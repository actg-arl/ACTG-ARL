I agree as to the original deliverables.  However, for the GE Turbine
Contract, an officer of the LLC who is named on the Secretary's certificate
(i.e., Duran, Calger or Thomas) should sign.  Just to be safe, we may also
want the M/D of the LLC who is named on the Secretary's certificate (i.e.,
Duran) to sign the LLC membership certificates. =20

Will you be sending the originals to me to forward to Freshfields and Paul
Hastings?

Here's what I have on my list as original deliverables

GE turbine contract - any officer of LLC
Amended LLC- any officer of ENA
Membership certificates - signed by MD of LLC, which isn't Jake

The only things I have which MUST be signed by Jake are the written
consents of the LLC, which aren't on the original deliverable list.  These
will be ready first thing Wednesday am.

I'm sorry,  I don't recall you telling me that the original membership
certificates had to be in New York on Wednesday. However, we will be able
to handle this.

This pre-closing drill is why I asked for a definitive, signed off  closing
list by mid-day Friday.

Thanks,

Kay

It won't be a big deal if we can get these documents into Federal Express
Tuesday night for delivery Wednesday as indicated below.  If there is a
chance that Jake will be late so as to miss the Fed Ex deadline, then we
need to make alternative arrangements for signature.  Otherwise Paul
Hastings will be forced to renegotiate its legal opinion with Freshfields,
and we owe them the courtesy of letting them know this first thing Tuesday
morning, as I indicated to them as early as Thursday of last week that we
had no objection to getting at least the original membership certificate to
them by overnight delivery prior to closing to hold in escrow until the
closing, in order to satisfy opinion issues associated with perfection of
the lien on the membership interest.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

As soon as I get back to the office, I will re-check the Salmon resolutions
electing officers to confirm Chris Calger's title with Salmon and will let
you know.

I think we will be able to get the documents you listed signed tomorrow,
but Jake won't be here before 7pm, so anything he is signing won't be ready
until Wednesday am.  It seems to me that this isn't a big deal, but I would
appreciate it if you could confirm.

Thanks,

The original membership certificate for the 80% interest should be
forwarded
for delivery on Wednesday, May 2, to the following address:

           Ms. Isabel Parker
           Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP

(Greg has asked that the membership certificate be faxed to him (fax
203-674-7646) and me (fax 713-751-3280) on Tuesday before depositing this
with the overnight courier).

If you will also be sending the original signature pages to the Turbine
Contract and the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement, these documents should
be forwarded for delivery on Wednesday, May 2, to:

           Mr. Gregory F. Lang
           Paul Hastings Janofsky & Walker LLP

Please confirm absolutely that fax signatures will be sufficient.

I need the address of where to send the membership certificate.  There is
not enough time for the document to pass back through Houston if the
Portland team wants to sign the documents.

The original membership certificate needs to be in the lender's hands
(i.e.,
Isabel Parker's office) on Wednesday in order to release escrow.  If you
have the original to me by Tuesday, I can forward it to Isabel by overnight
delivery for Wednesday.  It must be an original, in that the lender's lien
on the membership interest is not perfected without possession of the
original certificate.  With respect to the remaining documents, fax copies
of signature pages on the closing date should be sufficient.

Can we at least get the membership certificates signed by Tuesday?  This
seems to be the only document required in advance of closing.  If we can't
get the 80% membership interest certificate in the lender's possession on
the closing date, then there is a lien perfection issue for them to deal
with, and I thought we could accommodate their request and avoid the
problem
altogether.  Please advise, as Greg and Isabel will be calling within an
hour or so to finalize the mechanics on this.  Thanks.

I've asked GE for the LOC by Wednesday, but I haven't gotten a response.

I'll have difficulty getting executed docs by Tuesday, since sigs are
coming from Portland.  I'll have to check to see what can be done.

Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested
that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80%
interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to
hold
in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in
possession
of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on
Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing
documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with
another client most of the afternoon today).

There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for
the
retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I
advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after
receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE
about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts
on this?

Alberto Usobiaga who initially headed Azurix in Mexico is now working for

He tells me that he contacted Rebecca Mark and  John Garrison and offered 
them to buy all of Azurix Mexico's business (Cancun, IASA in Mexico City and 
the Leon and Torreon concessions).  There was no clear response.

If the Argentinian Government approves they might be iunterested at taking a

They are certainly ready for Mexico.

"The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $2.00/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity ""NewAlb"" that will return 9% assuming a book value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year for the next five."
"Attached is the referenced list.  Again, my note about credit derivatives not 
being marked, and also, I am still not responding for Australia yet on a 
going forward basis.
"
"I would'nt have it introduced by the ""corporate policy committee"".  I would 
say Enron is introducing or ""there is a new tool available to you"".  I am 
anxious to see how this goes over; it's a great tool.

Thanks for offering to participate.  I will probably go ahead and get her the 
gift certificate from Urban Retreat.  I just need to hear back from Mary 
before I get it.  Looks like everyone else has already gotten her a gift.  
Things are going great here.  Charles is now a little over 4 months old and 
almost 16 lbs. and is doing great.  I'm sorry that I haven't been up there 
for a visit but hopefully someday soon before he goes off to college I will 
come up for a visit!  Hope that you are doing well.  Look forward to seeing 
you soon.  Also, we are beginning the ""nanny"" search.  If you know of someone 
or agency that you would trust please let me know.  We are looking for 
someone to commute to our house each day, but can be flexible on the hours 
because Bill will be here.  Take care and thanks again for the offer on 
Suzanne's gift.  If I do something different, I'll let you know.

"Zulie:
I am teaching a junior achievement course to a third grade class at my son's 
school.  I would like to reward these kids for the work that they have done 
and someone in my group mentioned that in some cases, Enron has something 
akin to a ""goodie bag"" that they give out to kids.  Would I be eligible for 
this?  I wasn't sure if I would and thought that at least it doesn't hurt to 
ask.  My extension is 33989.

Subject: Equitabel Gas Company Exchange on Tetco

CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas 
Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is 
giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new 
best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the 
January transaction is complete.

Here are my questions/comments;

1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 
146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange.  
I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC.  
If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the 
new deal.  Please let me know ASAP.

2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to 
see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment 
was due.

3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it 
above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?

4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES 
deals.  He doesn't know if he should bill CES or Enron North America.  Who 
should he talk to about that??


Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.

Thanks

Vince,
I realise that you don't have time for email or anything these days.   I just wanted to say that I'm very sorry to hear about everything that is going  on at Enron.  I hope that you are OK?  
 
I understand that Enron Europe is pretty much ending  business tomorrow, except for Enron Metals.  It's all very  shocking and unbelievable.  Just to let you know, and maybe it will benefit  someone, we will be looking to hire someone to head some things up for us in  London.  So if you know of anyone who may be jobless over here, feel free  to have them contact me, or send them the attached draft job  description.      
 
Please stay in touch and best of luck to you.
 
Sincerely,
Julie Brennan

Kay:

We have attached execution copies of the following documents for execution
by GE:

1.  GE Letter re Forms of Agreement;
2.  GE Consent and Agreement;
3.  Legal Opinion of Counsel to GE;
4.  GE Receipt.

These documents were circulated by Isabel Parker to Kent Shoemaker, you, me
and others on April 23, 2001.

The only other document is the GE Parent Guaranty.  Greg Lang circulated
comments (in a PDF file) by an e-mail 4/18 at 5:59 p.m.   Greg asked earlier
today whether the form of this document had been agreed by GE and I could
not respond.

You should have the following documents:

1.  Assignment and Assumption Agreement; and
2.  Turbine Contract.

Several of the ENA documents are not yet finalized, so I will try to get
those to you after lunch.  Please send over the LLC certificate book in
order that we may prepare membership certificates.

If you have any questions or comments, please advise.  Thanks.

"John, 
 You know the answer.  Can you call the central desk for the price for spot 
gas to be sold to Heartland.  I spoke with Sylvia Pollan and she was to get 
back to me.

Charles,
 Can you redo the statement for physical gas through the 23rd and include a 
line item for the Mark-to-market true-up value as a result of the termination 
triggered by their bankruptcy filing.  Jason R Williams of the Credit group 
was to redo the termination payment amount.

Gerald,

In reviewing the changes I need to see what the ""Firm Schedules"" are.  This
looks like it is new and is apparently part of the Firm gathering
agreements.  Also, would it be possible to get a red-line version of the
documents that compares these latest changes with the originally executed
documents as I think some of the interim changes have been absorbed already.
Give me a call if you need any clarification.  713-624-9003.

From: ""Gerald Nemec"" <Gerald.Nemec@enron.com>, on 6/22/00 3:36 PM:



Attached are the latest revised redlined documents for Lost Creek.   Please
note
the following:

1.  The changes include those that Chris and I discussed in Denver.  The
Capacity Allocation Agreement is redlined against the version BR had reviewed
earlier.  All other docs. are redlined against the originals.

2.  Due to the Credit Agreement structure, portions of the Natural Gas Fuel
Liquidation concept were placed into the Administrative Services Agreement.
This was done in order to allow that portion of the Natural Gas Fuel value
which
covers the Power Bill to be included in the Debt Service Coverage Ratio calcs
in
the Credit Agreement.  The remainder of the Natural Gas Fuel will be
distributed
under the Capacity Allocation Agreement to avoid the inclusive of these excess
amounts in any distribution tests under the Credit Agreement.

3.  Since more significant changes were made to the Admin. Services Agreement,
it is now being amended and restated.

Dean,  have you resolved the accounting questions you raised this past Monday?

		 Subject: California Update--Legislative Push Underway


	


Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon 
of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the 
""core/noncore"" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to 
brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution 
for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in 
legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the ""Plan B"" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) 
will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is ""comprehensive,"" a complete legislative package will 
be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., 
core/noncore, ""Plan B,"" Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address 
(e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is 
what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a ""conference committee,"" 
comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a 
comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to 
the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue 
its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue 
requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be 
suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to 
review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 
15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a ""thought piece"" on Monday the 9th and 
will use reactions to the ""thought piece"" to craft the develop the proposed 
decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of 
the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the 
Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process."
"Would you let me know if confirmation letters have already been sent out for 
these deals? If not, is there any way to get them out before the holiday?

Thanks,
Kate

Here's my thinking: Fuck Gore (excuse my French). He's worse than Bush, 
because he's more of a political robot. The logical choice is, of course, as 
Jeff pointed out, Nader. The result will be that Nader loses, Gore loses, 
and Bush wins. But, four bad years is worth the  political message it will 
send, especially if it's strong. People must perish in wars of belief! (I 
saw a movie about Communist Russia last night, so excuse the slogans.) 
Furthermore, the poor Democrats should remember the days when 'ole Ross ""I 
got a pig in my pocket"" Perot stole countless votes from the Republicans. In 
such an election, it's time to go with one's conscience, not the lesser of 
two evils.

Power line plan has new foes
La Cresta residents vow to keep electricity equipment out of the Cleveland 
Forest and a wilderness area.

By Thomas Buckley
The Press-Enterprise
LAKE ELSINORE
A new group has raised its objections to Lake Elsinore's proposed 
hydroelectric plant and the power lines that might carry its electricity to 
San Diego County. 
On Thursday, the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District board set aside for 
further study later this month a motion by Director Gary Kelley to ensure 
that both the lines and the actual power plant that make up a $450 million 
proposal from Enron North America proceed together. 
But residents of La Cresta, a mountaintop community near where the lines 
might run, did not care whether the plant and lines happened together. Many 
of them do not want the lines to be there at all. 
""We are resolved to keep power lines out of the Cleveland National Forest and 
the San Mateo Wilderness Area,"" said La Cresta resident Bill Stockmar. ""Our 
constituents and the local residents impacted by the proposed project are 
outraged and respectfully demand immediate intervention to stop this project 
at the planning level."" 
As it stands now, the power lines from the hydroelectric plant would run from 
Temescal Canyon to Camp Pendleton along the ridge line of the Elsinore 
Mountains just west of the lake. Those lines could run in a narrow strip of 
forest land just west of the La Cresta community. 
Enron project manager Rob Bakondy said the final determination of where the 
lines might run is not set, but he said the power lines could be built at 
least a year before the plant itself. 
Besides serving the hydroelectric plant, the power lines could be used to 
replace lines San Diego Gas and Electric wants to build through Murrieta and 
Temecula to bring power to San Diego. 
The water district also announced it is considering financing and building 
the lines itself. 
District General Manager John Rossi said Wednesday that it was too early to 
say exactly how the lines would be built, but that the district's building or 
owning the lines, or both, in cooperation with Enron is ""one possibility."" 
Board President Kris Anderson said it is too early to tell whether it would 
benefit the district to become so directly involved in the project. But he 
said the district would be able to borrow the approximately $50 million 
needed to build the lines at a lower interest rate than a private company 
could get. That difference, Anderson said, could mean extra dollars for the 
district. 
How Governor Davis' proposal to purchase thousands of miles of transmission 
lines from the ailing utilities will affect the project is not yet clear, 
said Enron spokeswoman Kathy Russeth. 
The timing of the construction of the project, if it is approved by state and 
federal regulators, will not be finally known until a contract between Enron 
and the water district has been agreed upon. That is expected to happen by 
the end of May.

GOP in a fix over power crisis
Leaders seek solutions that won't undercut past support for deregulation 
By Daniel Borenstein
TIMES POLITICAL EDITOR 
California Republican Party leaders are trying desperately to politicize the 
state's electricity crisis by blaming Gray Davis, but it seems that the 
harder they try the more popular the Democratic governor becomes. 
The latest GOP push will come today when party leaders, meeting in Sacramento 
for the start of their three-day state convention, hold a hastily organized 
workshop on energy. 
""We should be explaining to California that Gray Davis was asleep at the 
switch last year,"" said one of the scheduled speakers, Republican strategist 
Dan Schnur. ""But that message can only work if it's coupled with a proposal 
for an alternative solution."" 
So far, that hasn't happened. For all the complaints about Davis, Republicans 
are moving even slower. Looking to 2002, when Davis will stand for 
re-election, the GOP has run radio ads attacking the governor for delays. But 
the party has yet to distinguish itself with a solid plan of its own. 
""If Republicans are able in the next couple of months to articulate a clear 
plan, which is different from the Democratic plan, yes, we can use it as a 
political message,"" said Stuart DeVeaux, spokesman for the California 
Republican Party. 
""Are Republicans in Sacramento going to come up with a plan that articulates 
a future for our energy problem? I'm not telling you it's going to be 
revealed this weekend. It's my hope it will be articulated this weekend."" 
Republicans are caught in an ideological quagmire. Pushing for re-regulation 
of electricity conflicts with the party's basic tenet of less government 
interference. Conversely, arguing for full deregulation puts Republicans at 
odds with a solid majority of Californians. 
A Los Angeles Times poll taken Feb. 14-15 found that 60 percent of 
Californians want to go back to a regulated electricity industry, while 25 
percent are opposed. 
The GOP problem is exacerbated because there is no easy policy solution to 
the energy mess, said Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna 
College. ""It's difficult to see how we get out of this situation without 
considerable cost. If there were a silver bullet, somebody would have found 
it by now."" 
Republicans have attacked Davis for his plan to buy power lines from private 
utilities. ""Everybody agrees there's $1 billion or $2 billion in deferred 
maintenance,"" said GOP consultant Sal Russo, another speaker at the party's 
convention today. ""We need to be in this business like a hole in the head."" 
But the Times poll found that Californians, by a 52-36 margin, favor the 
idea. Moreover, Davis' job approval rating has climbed this year. In January, 
49 percent approved and 25 percent disapproved. In February, it was up to 
57-26. Californians give Davis better marks for handling the electricity 
crisis than they give President Bush. 
Republicans are going to have difficult time laying the political blame on 
Davis. ""It's 'Murder on the Orient Express.' Everybody did it,"" Pitney said. 
""Although you can make a case that Davis was slow in reacting, no one can 
seriously pin him with the primary blame for the problem."" 
The deregulation bill passed the Legislature in 1996 with the strong support 
of both parties and a Republican governor, Pete Wilson. Senate Minority 
Leader Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, is considered one of the Republican 
Party's top strategists. He was also one of the leading proponents of the 
deregulation bill. 
For all of those reasons, Garry South, Davis' political strategist, said he 
does not fear a GOP attack on electricity. ""If the Republicans want to get 
into a full-out firefight over how this mess came about, I'm more than 
willing to play. They don't have a very good story to tell."" 
For now, Davis' political strength is stable. But the 2002 primary elections 
are still more than a year away, and the general election is a political 
eternity from now. 
""If this isn't resolved, there is nothing to guarantee that there won't be a 
voter backlash against the government,"" said political analyst Sherry Bebitch 
Jeffe. ""And right now the government in California is the Democratic Party."" 
That's the message the Republicans want to drive home. But if they can't come 
up with their own alternative, they might have a hard time playing the blame 
game.

Davis says state has tentative deal for Edison grid 


Updated: Feb. 23, 2001 - 4:42 p.m. 
LOS ANGELES -- After a week of intense closed-door negotiations with utility 
representatives, Gov. Gray Davis said Friday he had reached an ""agreement in 
principle"" with Southern California Edison to buy the utility's power lines 
for an estimated $2.7 billion. 

The deal also requires Edison International, the parent company of Edison, to 
sell cheap power to the state for a decade. 

""This is the framework of a good, balanced deal,"" Davis said. ""It's not a 
final deal. There's a lot of work to be done, But we're making progress."" 

The governor said he did not expect customer rates to increase as a result of 
the deal. 

Edison did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 

The state has been in talks for a week to buy a total of 26,000 miles of 
transmission lines from Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric and Sempra Energy, 
which operates San Diego Gas & Electric. The total cost of the lines could 
range from $4.5 billion to $7 billion. 

The effort is intended to help restore the financial health of the state's 
two largest utilities, PG&E and Edison, both of which are near bankruptcy. 
The $2.7 billion price for the Edison lines amounts to 2.3 times the 
estimated book value, Davis said. 

The utilities say they have lost nearly $13 billion since June, trapped 
between soaring wholesale power prices and state-imposed rate caps for 
consumers. The tentative plan announced by Davis would allow Edison to issue 
bonds for a substantial portion of its losses. 

Davis said the state is making good progress in its talks with Sempra and 
""some progress"" with PG&E. Thursday, Davis said he will not sign off on any 
grid buyout without all three utilities' participation. 

""I do not believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without 60 percent 
of the transmission grid, and that would require cooperation with PG&E,"" he 
said Friday. 

PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Thursday night that talks had ended with no 
resolution that day. 

""These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight,"" Low said. 
""There are clearly some issues where we are very far apart."" 

Still, PG&E chief executive officer Robert Glynn Jr. said Friday the meeting 
with Davis was a ""milestone in the resolution of California's energy crisis"" 
and said he was willing to meet further to discuss the utility's proposal. 

""Each utility's issues and opportunities in this crisis are different, and we 
believe that PG&E has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer 
and shareholder interests,"" Glynn said in a statement issued Friday before 
the governor's news conference. 

The company said it would have no further comment. 

The tentative agreement also calls for: 

Edison parent Edison International to make payments to the utility of about 
$420 million. 
Edison International to commit the entire output of its Sunrise Mission power 
project at low, cost-based rates for 10 years. Davis said that arrangement 
could save ratepayers $500 million over the next two years. 
Edison to provide cost-based rates from generating plants it owns for another 
10 years. 
Edison to drop its lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission 
claiming that imposed rate caps were illegal under federal law. 

""This entire transaction, which I believe is fair and balanced for both 
sides, will be accomplished within the existing rate structure,"" Davis said. 
""We will not be asking any more of consumers to allow this transaction to 
come to pass."" 

Davis said negotiations will continue in the coming days. 

Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called the governor's plan ""an outrageous 
giveaway"" and predicted that if lawmakers didn't halt it, voters would 
revolt. 

""The most outrageous part of this isn't even paying 2.3 times what the lines 
are worth, but then allowing the parent companies that siphoned off billions 
of dollars to pay only the tax payment they already owe,"" Rosenfield said. 

The Public Utilities Commission already regulates how much the utilities can 
charge for power their own plants generate, Rosenfield said.

Utilities Search for Long-Term Fix During Breather
State purchase of power lines under discussion 

Friday,?February 23, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
Sacramento -- A break in the weather and a break in the energy crisis 
coincided yesterday, as California enjoyed its first day in more than a month 
without a power alert. 
With the short-term picture for power improving, representatives of the 
state's three troubled utilities met separately with Gov. Gray Davis and his 
staff to work on a longer-range fix for the power crisis that would include 
state purchase of the firms' transmission lines. Trouble loomed in at least 
one set of talks, however, as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it was ""very 
far"" from reaching a deal. 
The California Independent System Operator, which coordinates the flow of 
electricity through the state's power grid, removed all power alerts at about 
9 a.m. yesterday. Spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said that with springtime 
approaching and weather improving, and with some power plants coming back to 
full output from maintenance, the overall picture is brightening. 
""We're optimistic,"" she said. ""We're coming into the spring season, the 
majority of generators have had their maintenance completed. But everything 
is dependent on the weather and temperature."" 
The last day California had no power alerts was Jan. 13. Since then, there 
have been two days of rolling blackouts in Northern California and many other 
days of Stage 3 alerts -- when power reserves dip below 1.5 percent of 
available capacity. 
The mildest alert, Stage 1, is declared when reserves are between 5 and 7 
percent of capacity. 
The supply of power has been helped by warmer temperatures in other Western 
states, cutting demand there, and by an increase in generators on line in 
California, O'Donley said. 
Last week, when the state was still in Stage 3 alerts, 10,500 megawatts were 
offline in California. Yesterday, there were 8,200 megawatts offline, a 
difference that provides enough power for a couple million homes. 
O'Donley warned that the supply picture in California is still tight, and 
conservation still necessary. But the focus of attention was turning to 
Sacramento and Davis' talks with the utilities. 
Davis announced a plan last week for the state to purchase 26,000 miles of 
utility-owned transmission lines in exchange for backing bonds that allow the 
utilities to repay the almost $13 billion in debt they say they owe. 
While Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric have 
indicated willingness to sell their lines, PG&E has refused to comment on the 
proposal. 
It is not clear if PG&E is unwilling to sell or simply trying to strike a 
harder bargain. The utility had accumulated more debt than its Southern 
California counterparts, and also owns the largest part of the transmission 
line grid. 
Talks between Davis' staff and PG&E did not start until late yesterday 
afternoon, and indications were that they were more difficult than 
negotiations involving the other two utilities. 
""They're just on a different page,"" Michael Peevey, the former Edison 
president who is Davis' chief negotiator, told Bloomberg News. 
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said, ""These are difficult problems that cannot be 
solved overnight. There are clearly some areas where we are very far apart."" 
Davis hopes to make an announcement with at least one of the utilities before 
leaving today for the four-day National Governors Association meeting in 
Washington, D.C. 
The union that represents some 11,000 PG&E employees, meanwhile, called on 
Davis to negotiate state ownership of two power plants under construction in 
which PG&E holds large stakes. 
Jack McNally, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers, Local 1245, in Walnut Creek told Davis in a letter that a 
transmission line takeover would be a ""grand experiment"" fraught with danger. 
Acquiring the two prospective power plants, in Kern and San Diego counties, 
would do more to address energy shortages than taking over transmission lines 
that need hundreds of millions of dollars in maintenance, union officials 
said. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio countered that state acquisition of 
transmission lines ""would not affect one union job,"" as the state would 
simply lease the grid back to the utilities. Maviglio predicted union jobs 
would increase with investment in new capacity and system upgrades. 
Chronicle staff writers Patrick Hoge and Robert Salladay contributed to this 
report.

State's energy price tag increases 
Published Friday, Feb. 23, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY DION NISSENBAUM 

Mercury News Sacramento Bureau 


SACRAMENTO -- California's energy crisis took another big bite out of the 
state budget Thursday when finance aides to Gov. Gray Davis announced that 
the cost of buying energy may top $3 billion by mid-March. 
In a move that raised new alarms for lawmakers, the governor's finance team 
for the third time this month asked for $500 million to buy electricity in 
the coming weeks while Davis tries to work out a deal to bail out the state's 
near-bankrupt utilities. That, combined with money spent last month to buy 
energy, could drain the state coffers of $3 billion by St. Patrick's Day. 
The request for more cash came on the same day that California spent its 
first day in weeks without an official energy emergency and Davis held 
critical talks with the heads of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas 
& Electric Co. The talks are aimed at rescuing the two companies and Southern 
California Edison from financial collapse. 
While Davis had expressed hope last week of working out a deal by today, 
sources said that an agreement still remains elusive. 
Until a compromise can be hammered out, the state is being forced to pay 
upward of $50 million a day from the general fund to buy electricity. 
State leaders expect that the money will eventually be repaid to the general 
fund under a $10 billion bond package. But lawmakers are growing increasingly 
concerned about the short-term impact on the state fiscal plan. 
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, said the latest request for 
more money could create ``greater concern and anxiety'' among lawmakers and 
added that the energy crisis was going to make it harder to fund other 
programs, such as support for abused children. 
``It's going to be a bleak year for other budget priorities,'' said Migden, 
who is chairwoman of the powerful Assembly Appropriations Committee. 
Earlier this week, the state's independent financial analyst warned that the 
energy crisis could eat into state money the governor wants to spend on other 
things such as the environment and public safety. 
While lawmakers have so far bitten their tongues about the growing power 
price tag, Migden said the Legislature might be hesitant to allow the costs 
to go any higher. 
``I can't imagine another infusion after this being required,'' Migden said. 
``I think this has to be the last request because we're going to hit 
fundamental core programs.'' 
Waiting for bailout plan 
California stepped in to buy the energy last month after PG&E and Southern 
California Edison lost the financial wherewithal to do it themselves. At the 
time, state leaders reluctantly agreed to buy the energy for a short period 
of time as part of a larger plan for California to sign long-term contracts 
with power generators. 
But those negotiations have failed to produce much energy so far, and Davis 
said earlier this week that the power producers are hesitant to sign any 
deals until California agrees to a bailout plan for the utilities. On 
Thursday, one power producer -- Williams Cos. -- announced that it had signed 
a 10-year contract with the state to provide up to 1,400 megawatts of power 
to California. 
In a bid to work out the bailout plan, Davis and his advisers met Thursday 
and were to meet again today with top executives from all three electric 
utilities in financial trouble. The Democratic governor wants to buy 26,000 
miles of high voltage transmission lines owned by the three companies in 
exchange for helping the utilities pay off $13 billion in debts. The 
utilities are being asked to protect thousands of acres of wilderness lands 
they own, hang onto power plants that provide the state with its cheapest 
electricity, and drop explosive lawsuits that could allow the companies to 
dramatically raise customer rates. 
But sources said talks have bogged down on the transmission line deal, which 
PG&E has been reluctant to accept. 
Alternative energy helps out 
While talks slogged along in the governor's office, state lawmakers announced 
that another key piece of the puzzle needed to solve the energy crisis was 
falling into place. 
State Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa 
Cruz, said that alternative energy producers had agreed to dramatically lower 
their prices in a deal that could save California $3 billion to $4 billion. 
Those energy producers, nearly 700 wind, solar and natural gas-fired plants, 
provide about a third of the state's energy.

Paying for power still a big question
POWER CRISIS 
PG&E doesn't like the plan the PUC proposed to collect electricity costs 
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
Three weeks after Gov. Gray Davis signed into law the state's centerpiece for 
stabilizing energy costs, big differences remain over how the solutions will 
be implemented and who will pay for them. 
The plan, outlined in legislation known as AB1X, was intended first to stop 
the financial bleeding of California's two largest utilities by asking the 
state to buy enough unsecured power to keep the lights on. Next, the state 
would enter long-term contracts for less expensive power that would 
eventually lessen the need for more costly, last-minute electricity. 
But the state has balked at buying the entire portfolio of last-minute 
electricity that is needed, and a disagreement emerged Thursday over what 
portion of consumers' bills should be used to reimburse state coffers. 
Meanwhile, progress on completing contracts has been slow, although two were 
signed Thursday. 
A spokesman for Davis said more contracts for relatively low-cost power would 
be signed once the state bought the utilities' transmission lines and other 
assets, because then the utilities could pay their past-due bills. The 
governor said last week that he expected a deal with the utilities by today, 
but that might not happen. 
""Clearly, there's been challenges getting long-term contracts, but we've 
turned the corner,"" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. ""We've got three in 
the bank and 10 more once we get these deals (with the utilities) done."" 
Also Thursday, the Public Utilities Commission was poised to allow the state 
to collect the entire amount that customers pay specifically for electricity. 
But Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said it is entitled to deduct other costs from 
customers' payments before reimbursing the state. That would reduce payments 
from PG&E to the state by about half, according to the company. 
The PUC proposal was in response to a request from the state Department of 
Water Resources that it be allowed to start collecting money so that energy 
companies would be more willing to sell power to the agency. 
The two Republican-appointed commissioners of the PUC blocked the move, which 
needed four of five commissioners' approval to reach the agenda. 
""DWR's (action) is exacerbating a problem AB1X was meant to alleviate,"" said 
Commissioner Richard Bilas. ""It is pushing the utilities closer to 
bankruptcy."" 
PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the proposal brought by PUC President Loretta 
Lynch would have been unfair to the utilities because AB1X allows them to 
deduct expenses for buying electricity and generating energy at their own 
power plants before reimbursing the state. 
""All of those costs need to be paid going forward. Otherwise, you still leave 
the utilities to bleed,"" Nelson said. 
That stance appeared to be at odds with the office of Assemblyman Fred 
Keeley, the Boulder Creek Democrat who wrote AB1X. 
""For PG&E to think it can keep money for electrons it never even owned is 
astounding to us,"" said Guy Phillips, a Keeley aide. 
While nothing has gone smoothly, Phillips and others expressed optimism that 
the state's biggest effort to date to fix the energy crisis would work. 
""We think those will be sorted out,"" said Phillips, who acknowledged there 
has been much confusion about what lawmakers intended in AB1X. 
For example, Keeley's office said lawmakers wanted the water resources agency 
to make up the entire amount of electricity that the state's two largest 
utilities had not secured ahead of time. The high cost of this last-minute 
electricity -- and the utilities' heavy reliance on it -- is what drove PG&E 
and Southern California Edison to the brink of bankruptcy. 
But the water agency has balked at buying electricity offered at prices it 
calls ""unreasonable."" While state officials have refused to say how much 
electricity it has left to utilities to purchase, the state is paying about 
$55 million a day to keep electricity flowing. 
And that amounts to about 90 percent of the electricity purchased on behalf 
of the utilities on the same day it is needed, according to Phillips. 
The state's reluctance to buy all of the so-called real-time electricity has 
led to fears that the utilities will continue to run up debt and that power 
companies will not collect money owed to them. That dispute has landed in 
federal court, where a Sacramento judge is forcing three major power 
suppliers and a marketing company to continue selling power in the state. 
If a settlement is not reached today, U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell is 
expected to decide whether to extend his order, to modify it or to drop it.

Lowenthal returns utility money 

By Will Shuck
From our Sacramento Bureau 

SACRAMENTO Assemblyman Alan Lowenthal, D-Long Beach, this week joined a small 
group of legislators who returned campaign contributions to California 
utility companies and other energy firms. 

He sent $5,000 back to Southern California Edison and $500 to Sempra Energy, 
parent company of Southern California Gas. It was a small portion of the more 
than Lowenthal $500,000 Lowenthal had raised in 2000 for his re-election 
campaign. 
He said he returned the money, as did nine other Assembly members, at the 
urging of the consumer advocacy group Global Exchange. 
""We think it's fantastic that he has recognized that in the eyes of the 
public there is a very serious potential conflict of interest,"" said group 
spokeswoman Medea Benjamin. ""We applaud him for wanting to ensure the 
integrity of the legislative process."" 
While Benjamin says it's critical that lawmakers not be tainted by energy 
money during the state's power crisis, others wonder where the line should be 
drawn. 
""In the real world of politics it costs money to run for office and you have 
to get that money somewhere,"" said Paul Schmidt, a political science 
professor at Cal State Long Beach. ""To say that you can only make decisions 
on things involving individuals that haven't given you any money would result 
in paralysis of government."" 
Benjamin and other consumer advocates say the power crisis calls for special 
consideration. 
""There are not many cases in which they're actually voting whether a company 
will survive with billions of dollars of taxpayer money or go bankrupt, as 
they're doing with the utility companies,"" Benjamin said. 
Lowenthal agreed. ""I thought it was an appropriate request,"" he said. ""These 
are unique circumstances, and I just think it's in the public's best interest 
that I return that money.""

Dan Walters: A power grab by politicians 


(Published Feb. 23, 2001) 
Slowly, but inexorably, control over the generation, acquisition and 
distribution of electric power in California is being shifted from 
professional utility managers and independent regulators into the hands of 
politicians. 
The 1996 utility ""deregulation"" scheme enacted by the Legislature was an 
initial foray into politicization. Legislation granting the governor more 
control over the makeup of the Public Utilities Commission was another. But 
the current power supply/price crisis has led to even more direct political 
influence over -- or interference with -- electric service. One hastily 
enacted bill, for example, gives the governor direct control of the 
now-misnamed ""Independent System Operator,"" which operates the statewide 
power grid. 
More political intrusion is in the works, from a state takeover of the 
intercity power transmission grid to the creation of a state power authority 
that would buy, generate and sell electricity directly. And while local 
public utilities function well, a state power agency might operate on the 
whims of professional politicians. The Legislature, for example, wants 
appointments to the board that would direct a state power authority, and big 
state power projects would be subject to the same kind of pork-barrel 
mentality that distorts other public works appropriations. Where power plants 
were to be built, or where high-voltage lines would be strung, might well 
depend on who could, and could not, bring political influence to bear, rather 
than what the system needed to work efficiently. 
Clues to the potential pitfalls of a state-operated power system are found in 
the approaches of Capitol politicians to the current crisis. There is, for 
example, the unspoken goal of avoiding big power rate boosts until after the 
November 2002 election -- even if it means running up billions of dollars in 
debts to do it. Would future rates charged by a state power authority be 
raised or lowered to enhance the prospects of the dominant party or an 
incumbent governor? There's no evidence in past performances to indicate they 
wouldn't be. 
And then there's the knotty question of who would get vital power supplies in 
the event of shortages -- a situation that is already looming and could 
become worse in future months. 
Emergency legislation already gives the state the right to sell power as it 
pleases, without competitive bidding or even public notice. There's nothing, 
really, to prevent politically influential power customers such as big 
industrial enterprises from cutting their own supply deals with politically 
directed state officials. 
And whose juice would be cut off if shortages mean blackouts? Approximately 
45 percent of current power customers are effectively exempt from rolling 
blackouts because they are connected to circuits (called ""blocks"") that also 
include vital services, such as hospitals, fire and police agencies, water 
supply systems and communications centers. The Capitol, not surprisingly, is 
in one of those noninterruptible blocks. 
With the threat of further blackouts looming, legislation is being drafted to 
designate which customers will suffer and which will not -- thus taking that 
authority out of the hands of utilities and regulators. And that, in turn, is 
generating pressure from lobbyists from all sorts of interest groups to place 
their clients on protected lists. Should farmers be cut off, or biotechnology 
facilities, or computer chip plants, or schools? 
When politicians control any process or system, one can be certain that they 
will always make expedient political decisions, regardless of the long-term 
or wider consequences. Thus, we may someday regret allowing the Capitol's 
self-serving politicians to get their hands on our electric power system.

Discount Urged Near Power Plants
Senator urges electricity rate break for neighbors of generators 

Friday,?February 23, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
As California officials propose building 32 new ""peaker"" power plants across 
the state by July, one legislator from plant-rich eastern Contra Costa County 
thinks residents should get a discount on their power bill for having a 
generator in their backyard. 
The proposed bill would provide a little payback for residents of state Sen. 
Tom Torlakson's district, which is home to a half-dozen plants and has three 
more in the construction pipeline. 
Under the bill introduced yesterday by Torlakson, D-Antioch, people living 
within a 20-mile circle around a power plant would receive a 20 percent 
discount on their electricity bill and be exempt from blackouts. 
The legislation was partially inspired by San Jose officials' rejecting a 
proposal to build a 600-megawatt power plant in the Coyote Valley, as well as 
Gov. Gray Davis' plan to build 5,000 megawatts of new generating capacity by 
July 1. 
""It's a question of fairness,"" Torlakson said. ""People in communities who are 
shouldering the burden for having plants in their backyard should get some 
benefit from it."" 
Torlakson said consumers who lived in communities without plants could pick 
up the tab for the discounts. ""But the utilities would have to figure that 
out within their rate system,"" he said. 
A PG&E spokesman said yesterday that the company does not comment on pending 
legislation. 
While consumer advocates, environmentalists and power generators were 
lukewarm to the proposal yesterday, many admit that the state has not thought 
about how to -- of even if they have to -- offer communities a little 
incentive to approve a power plant within their borders. However, the state 
has allocated $30 million for plants that get online by July 1. 
""As far as incentives, I'd think most communities would see the value of the 
employment they'd get and the increase to the tax base,"" said Larry Hamlin, 
the governor's recently appointed project manager for the plant-building 
campaign. 
A spokesman for California's Environmental Protection Agency, which permits 
plants, said the plan might be a ""worthwhile idea for making power plants 
more palatable to Californians."" 
Michael Shames, head of Utility Consumer Action Network in San Diego said the 
bill was attacking a ""not in my back yard"" problem that doesn't exist. ""Many 
San Diego communities are clamoring for plants in the hope that they would 
bring stability to the market,"" he said. 
James Peters of Mirent, the Atlanta-based company formerly known as Southern 
Energy, said the plan wouldn't encourage generators to build the number of 
plants needed to solve the energy crisis. 
Already, communities like Pittsburg have cut deals with power generators 
before letting them build. In exchange for letting the Calpine Corp. build 
two large plants in town, Pittsburg received the lifetime option to purchase 
100 megawatts of power at below-market rates. 
Next week, a Pittsburg group is going to begin gathering signatures demanding 
that city leaders use the estimated 26 megawatts it would take to light 
residences and businesses to give local residents a break on bills. The group 
will hold an organizational meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Los Medanos 
Community Hospital, 2311 Loveridge Rd. in Pittsburg.

At last, power alerts are lifted: Enjoy respite because crisis far from 
resolved, experts say
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published Feb. 23, 2001) 
As oddly as it arrived, California's electric emergency lifted Thursday 
morning. 
At 9 a.m., the Independent System Operator, which controls most of 
California's grid, ended a Stage 1 alert. 
It was the first time since Jan. 13 that the state hadn't been under a power 
emergency, declared when low supplies threaten grid stability. The alerts 
included 32 straight days of Stage 3 emergencies, the black clouds that 
gather before rotating outages. 
The clouds cleared on a day when predicted peak use was low -- but not the 
lowest it has been for the last five weeks. Many power plants were back on 
line after repairs -- but more plants had been operating during at least one 
Stage 3 day. 
So what happened? 
A little luck, a little planning and maybe a little group psychology, said 
those who have closely watched recent gyrations of the state's electric 
roller coaster. 
""It is a roll of the dice,"" said Gary Ackerman, head of the Western Power 
Trading Forum, which represents plant owners and marketers. ""If it continues 
for the next three or four weeks I wouldn't be too surprised. That'll be our 
respite. Enjoy it."" 
The end of a 40-day string of emergencies could mean a few more lights in 
store aisles or a little less worry about running an electric furnace. Some 
speculated it might also mean lower wholesale prices. 
But major changes are not likely in the steady rain of conservation calls 
that have fallen on Californians since the north state was twice plunged into 
rotating blackouts last month. 
""I hope people don't just go back to wasteful ways,"" said Mike Florio of The 
Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. 
Now that the emergencies have dissipated, ""we don't have to talk about 
imposing hardships on people, but prudent use of energy is an idea we're 
going to have to live with for a long time,"" he said. 
At the ISO, longer days and slightly warmer weather was credited with 
decreasing peak demand for electricity. Supplies are up within the state, and 
power imports from the Pacific Northwest have risen significantly, said Jim 
Detmers, who manages grid operations. 
Plus, in one of the biggest changes, the state Department of Water Resources 
has begun getting more power supplies lined up at least a day in advance, he 
said. 
Since the department stepped in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped 
utilities, it has often managed to line up about 70 percent to 75 percent of 
what the state needed to supplement utility-controlled supplies, according to 
Detmers. That meant grid operators had to scramble to buy the rest on very 
short notice. 
But starting last Friday, the state began to schedule about 90 percent of its 
purchases at least one day in advance. 
""The operators are able to enter a day with a lot more confidence about being 
able to make it,"" Detmers said. ""You don't have to search to find those 
megawatts at the last minute."" 
Closely in sync with increased purchases by the state, the ISO dropped from a 
Stage 3 emergency to Stage 2 on Friday, and then slid to a Stage 1 Wednesday. 
The stages are based on how much reserve power is left for unexpected crises; 
a Stage 3 is declared when reserves slip below 1.5 percent. 
For their part, power buyers at the water resources department weren't sure 
what has made the difference over the past few days. 
""It's certainly not that people are lining up to sell us power at cheap 
prices,"" said Jim Spence, the department's director of emergency operations. 
""We're just buying whatever we can, and it turned out that it was easier to 
make ends meet."" 
He said he couldn't make any prediction about how long that would last. 
The string of power emergencies has been unpredictable from the start, 
erupting in winter, when California's hunger for electricity traditionally 
declines and supplies are usually so flush that plants close for tune-ups. 
Consumer advocates and power traders blamed finances for the emergencies, 
rather than a fundamental lack of supply, as fears of utility bankruptcies 
triggered a descent into market chaos and high-stakes political maneuvering. 
But basic supply shortages are expected to move to the forefront by summer, 
when temperatures rise and demand soars. 
Meanwhile, the brief respite -- whatever the reason -- brought palpable 
relief to those charged with keeping the power grid stable. 
""When we found out yesterday during the board meeting that we were only in 
Stage 1, we broke out in applause,"" said Florio, who sits on the five-member 
ISO board. 
The change also could be good news for consumers, who may one day be paying 
higher rates for the wholesale electricity now being purchased by the state. 
""Getting out of a Stage 3 typically means prices are going to ease,"" Florio 
said. ""When you're even in a Stage 1, that's a signal to everybody, 'They're 
short, that means we can hold them up now.' ""

Davis' deadlines on energy much easier set than met
By Emily Bazar
Bee Staff Writer
(Published Feb. 23, 2001) 
Exactly one week ago, Gov. Gray Davis sounded hopeful, optimistic even, when 
he predicted that the state and its debt-ridden utilities would forge an 
agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom. 
Problem is, it won't work out that way. 
Negotiations between state officials and the investor-owned utilities have 
produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today. 
Davis' predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before. 
For weeks, he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that 
haven't been met. On deadline days, even when there's little substantive 
progress to report, Davis often holds news conferences anyway -- many of them 
on Friday afternoons after financial markets close. 
The Democratic governor's office scheduled an ""announcement"" for today in Los 
Angeles, even though one utility representative said agreement is far away. 
Davis' actions have fueled speculation that he's trying to force consensus by 
setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news, and tarnishing 
the state's credibility in the process. 
""I can't see how you would negotiate such a complex deal, like the purchase 
of the transmission grid, in such a short period of time. It doesn't seem 
realistic,"" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an 
association of wholesale generators. ""I guess the people I represent have 
turned it off. They have stopped listening. They hear it and say, 'OK, sure. 
Here's another photo op.' "" 
Last Friday, Davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the 
utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities. 
""I believe we'll have agreement before next week is out, on exactly what 
should go in a piece of legislation,"" he said at the time. ""And hopefully, 
that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week."" 
Legislative veterans said his comments were ill-advised and unrealistic. 
Davis met into the night Thursday with top officials of Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., but no agrement was reached. 
""These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight,"" said PG&E 
spokesman Ron Low. ""On some issues, we are very far away from agreement."" 
Sources said PG&E has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission 
lines, which Davis has said is a necessary component of a deal. More progress 
was reported with the two other near-bankrupt companies -- San Diego Gas and 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison -- although sources said talks 
with them were far from concluded. 
Davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the Legislature for 
months: 
In November, the governor promised to present a comprehensive ""plan"" by Dec. 
1 to stave off a full-blown energy crisis, but ended up offering only a 
modest slate of proposals. 
Davis called Feb. 12 a ""drop dead"" date by which he hoped to cement a deal 
between lawmakers and the utilities. There's no deal yet. 
Davis told reporters that he and the state's legislative leaders would reach 
a ""consensus agreement"" on the proposal to take to utilities by last Friday. 
It didn't happen; he made the announcement alone. 
Leon Panetta, a White House chief of staff under former President Clinton, 
said it's important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of 
politics is to delay. 
However, he cautioned against missing deadlines. 
""You have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish, because 
the more that you establish and not meet, the more that begins to lose its 
value as a political tool,"" Panetta said. 
The governor can't continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing 
consequences, cautioned Steven Fetter, managing director of the Global Power 
Group at Fitch, a credit-rating agency based in New York. 
At some point, he warned, creditors and power suppliers may push the 
utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, which would trigger an official 
deadline that can't be ignored. The dispute would be tied up in court at a 
judge's discretion. 
""Eventually, there is going to be a real deadline,"" Fetter said. ""The problem 
is it's probably not a deadline that will be set by Gov. Davis. It's a 
deadline that will be set by the banks and the (electricity) suppliers."" 
In several cases when deadlines haven't been met, Davis has held a news 
conference regardless, unveiling little new information and scant detail. 
On Jan. 26, for instance, the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan 
to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated. 
One prong of the plan: ""Aggressively promote energy efficiency, conservation 
and demand reduction among consumers, businesses and public entities."" 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said that the governor continues to set 
deadlines because it's important to show that the state is making progress, 
particularly to Wall Street. 
He added that it's not the governor's fault the deadlines have been missed. 
""Many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to 
foresee or have control over: court decisions, actions by creditors, weather, 
you name it,"" Maviglio said. ""The governor sets deadlines that continue to 
move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that."" 
Many of these announcements came after 2 p.m. on Fridays, triggering 
suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate 
the markets. 
Timing announcements after the close of East Coast financial markets is 
commonly used by politicians who don't want to send stocks soaring or 
tumbling by making an announcement, Panetta said. 
""You want people to evaluate what's happening so there isn't a panic reaction 
to a news flash going over the wire,"" he said. 
But market analysts say that ever since PG&E and Edison stocks plummeted in 
early January, the governor's statements haven't significantly affected their 
performance. 
""There has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that 
I don't think it makes much of a difference,"" said Ed Schuller, a senior vice 
president for the full-service brokerage firm Sutro & Co. ""It's beyond that 
point now.""

GOP Sees Power Crisis as Davis' Achilles' Heel
Republicans line up to run for governor 

Friday,?February 23, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, politically wounded by the state's power woes, 
has become the target of a growing pack of Republicans looking to turn him 
out of office. 
""Four months ago, Davis looked on track to get re-elected by a voice vote,"" 
said Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist. ""But the energy crisis has exposed 
vulnerabilities that have encouraged others to look at the (2002 governor's) 
race."" 
The governor's backers, however, are confident California voters will 
recognize Davis is dealing with a problem that has been brewing for years, 
through previous Republican administrations. 
""If the Republicans want to have a full-out firefight over who brought this 
(energy crisis) down, we're ready for it,"" said Garry South, the governor's 
top political adviser. ""It's a fight they can't win."" 
With the primary election still more than a year away, no one but Davis is a 
sure bet to leap into the contest, but at least three names will be 
circulating when California Republicans meet in Sacramento this weekend for 
their state convention. 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, Los Angeles investor Bill Simon Jr. and actor 
Arnold Schwarzenegger all have made noises about challenging Davis, but so 
far their incipient campaigns have been more talk than action. 
Simon's effort might be the farthest along, but he also has the longest way 
to travel. A political unknown, the 49-year-old Simon runs his family's 
investment company and has been active in a number of charitable 
organizations in Southern California. 
Simon, whose father was treasury secretary under President Richard Nixon, has 
brought in veteran GOP consultant Sal Russo to study a possible run for 
governor. 
""Bill Simon feels we need a governor who's prepared to lead and not one who's 
focused on fund-raising or the next political office,"" Russo said in a jab at 
Davis. 
Simon was an assistant U.S. attorney in New York, but founded William E. 
Simon & Sons with his brother and late father in 1988. The $2 billion private 
investment firm owns a number of companies and has also invested heavily in 
South of Market real estate in San Francisco. 
Wealthy political outsiders don't have an enviable record in recent 
California elections. Republican Michael Huffington spent $29 million to lose 
a 1994 Senate race to Dianne Feinstein. Darrell Issa dropped around $13 
million in a losing race for the 1998 GOP Senate nomination. Al Checchi spent 
about $38 million of his own money to lose the Democratic primary to Davis in 
1998. 
While Simon likely would be spending plenty of his own money on a governor's 
bid, he's working to get outside support, both political and financial, 
before committing to the race, Russo said. 
With the state's problems mounting and the economy increasingly shaky, the 
time may be ripe for a political unknown, he added. 
""When things start going bad, people are willing to look outside for a new 
face, someone who will get things done,"" Russo said. 
Jones is anything but a political outsider. A veteran legislator from the 
Fresno area, he is now serving his second and last term as California's 
secretary of state. He managed to hang onto his job during the GOP's 1998 
electoral debacle, which cost the party every other constitutional office. 
While Jones has long talked about a run for governor, he's still playing coy. 
""We have not made any decision and probably won't make one until early 
March,"" said Rob Lapsley, one of Jones' top advisers. ""Right now we're 
putting together information for Bill to make a decision."" 
While Jones' role as the state's top GOP officeholder makes him an obvious 
choice to challenge Davis, he's made a number of political enemies over the 
years, many of them in his own party. His surprise decision last year to 
switch his support from George W. Bush to Arizona Sen. John McCain in 
California's presidential primary won him no fans among Bush supporters and 
could hurt his attempts to raise money for a gubernatorial bid. 
Money is a major problem for Jones, who listed $118,000 in his campaign fund 
last month, compared with nearly $26 million for Davis. Some of his opponents 
have suggested that fund-raising woes may force Jones to run for an office 
other than governor. 
""Right now, we're focused on the governor's race,"" Lapsley insisted. 
The real Republican wild card is Schwarzenegger, the movie action hero who 
would be instantly recognized by nearly every California voter. 
While Schwarzenegger's publicist told The Chronicle last month that he had no 
plans to get involved in next year's governor's race, the Austrian-born star 
was on the telephone to a Los Angeles Times columnist days later, talking 
about his love for politics and his political ambitions. 
Fame, however, has its drawbacks, as the 53-year-old Schwarzenegger has 
found. An article in Premiere magazine entitled ""Arnold the Barbarian"" 
accused him of groping women on movie sets and generally boorish behavior, 
while the supermarket tabloids have him on the cover this week, suggesting 
that his marriage to Maria Shriver is on the rocks. 
South, Davis' political adviser, gleefully sent copies of the Premiere 
article to reporters across the state, suggesting that ""the piece lays out a 
real 'touching' story -- if you get what I mean."" 
Whoever ends up with the GOP nomination still will face an uphill battle 
against Davis, a popular governor and a ""take no prisoners"" campaigner. 
""I've been predicting since Day One that the GOP would find some moneybags 
candidate to throw against Gray,"" South said. ""That's why we've kept our 
political and fund-raising operation going since election day.""

Pressure Is on Utilities to Accept Grid Sale 

Energy: Gov. Davis wants accord today, but Edison executive says company 
might prefer bankruptcy. 

By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers 

?????SACRAMENTO--His credibility at risk and California's energy future on 
the line, Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday turned up the heat on the state's 
utilities to accept today a series of tentative rescue accords that would put 
the companies' transmission systems into public hands.
?????How far the utilities are willing to bend to the governor's intensified 
pressure was unclear late Thursday. Given Davis' mandate, a top executive of 
Southern California Edison said his company is now being forced to seriously 
contemplate whether it might fare better in Bankruptcy Court.
?????""We are weighing two very unpalatable alternatives,"" he said.
?????Two alternatives facing the utilities are either to sell their 
electrical transmission systems to the state at a price they consider too low 
or gamble in Bankruptcy Court that they could hang onto their valuable assets.
?????After nearly a week of negotiations, Davis administration officials said 
they hoped to announce today a partial deal that would calm the utilities' 
jittery creditors and help subdue California's runaway electricity market.
?????State officials said Thursday they were close to agreements with Edison 
and San Diego Gas & Electric but remained at odds with the state's biggest 
utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, which has balked at giving up its 
transmission grid.
?????""These are complex issues that cannot be resolved overnight,"" said PG&E 
spokesman Ron Lowe. ""There are clearly some areas where we are very far 
apart.""
?????On Thursday, Edison Chairman John Bryson conferred with members of his 
utility's board of directors. But by evening, the company's top executives 
still had not decided whether to acknowledge that an agreement is near.
?????Although the utility has begun to contemplate the protections of 
bankruptcy, it is unclear when, or if, such a dramatic action would occur.
?????Davis is believed to be offering roughly $7 billion for the utilities' 
transmission grids. The companies could use the cash to restructure their 
debt, which resulted from the utilities' inability to pass along their 
soaring wholesale electricity costs to ratepayers.
?????Davis has significant political and fiscal reasons for wanting to make 
an announcement today. He is scheduled to arrive in Washington for the 
National Governor's Assn. conference this weekend, meet with U.S. Energy 
Secretary Spencer Abraham on Sunday, and attend the Democratic Governors 
Assn. annual fund-raising dinner Monday night.
?????Davis, a prodigious fund-raiser, is chairman of the Democratic Governors 
Assn., and the dinner is expected to raise more than $5 million. Of that 
amount, Davis' political organization raised in excess of $1 million, said 
Garry South, his chief political advisor.
?????Any progress Davis can cite could help improve his national political 
standing. But his aides say it's especially important to be able to show at 
least a semblance of an agreement when he travels to New York on Wednesday to 
confer with Wall Street analysts.
?????On Thursday, those analysts reacted exuberantly to early hints from the 
governor's office that settlements with the utilities might be announced.
?????The recently anemic stocks of Edison International and PG&E Corp. soared 
on the New York Stock Exchange on a day when most utility stocks closed lower.
?????Edison jumped $1.50 per share, or 11.15%, to close at $14.95 while PG&E 
gained $1.49, or 11.41%, to $14.55 per share.
?????""That suggests that someone thinks something good is happening in 
Sacramento,"" said analyst James D. von Riesemann of Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter & Co.
?????But some analysts fear investor enthusiasm might be hasty.
?????""I'm concerned that the governor's optimism may not coincide with all 
the parties at the table and it may not coincide with the Legislature,"" said 
Paul Patterson, utility analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.
?????Davis met Thursday with Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra, the parent 
company of SDG&E. Administration officials are confident that an agreement 
can be reached. But the San Diego company is the smallest of the state's 
three major private utilities, and its debt is far smaller--$605 million, 
compared to the combined $12.7 billion that Edison and PG&E say they have 
amassed.
?????""[Baum] is willing to listen,"" said Sempra spokesman Doug Kline. "" . . . 
We're on the record as stating that we are willing to consider the sale of 
those [transmission] assets if it helps solve the crisis.""
?????PG&E executives had been scheduled to start meeting with Davis at 11 
a.m. Thursday. But in what was seen a slight against PG&E, Davis' aides did 
not summon negotiators for the Northern California utility, including company 
Chairman Robert Glynn, until after 3:30.
?????Although the parties continued to wrangle over details, there was 
progress Thursday on the sidelines. 
?????State officials announced they had signed a long-term contract for a 
relatively small amount of electricity with a major energy supplier--an 
achievement that was perhaps more symbolic than substantive.
?????Tulsa-based Williams Cos. said it had agreed to a 10-year deal to sell 
power to the Department of Water Resources. By April, the company will 
provide at least 175 megawatts--enough electricity to supply 175,000 
homes--at times of the day when demand for electricity soars. Such peak 
supplies will increase through next summer and reach 900 megawatts by 2006, 
according to Williams.
?????The agreement is only the second such long-term contract since Davis 
signed a bill Feb. 1 putting the Department of Water Resources into the 
power-buying business for many years to come.
?????At least 10 other power suppliers have reached understandings with the 
state, Davis said Wednesday. But those companies refuse to sign deals, the 
governor said, until the state finds a way to help California's two biggest 
utilities pay off their billion-dollar debts.
?????""As soon as we revitalize the utilities,"" the governor said, ""I think 
you'll see a lot of movement on long-term contracts.""
?????Another small but important piece of the state's energy plan emerged 
Thursday when legislation was introduced by Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta) to 
slash the rates paid to alternative energy producers--a move expected to 
shave $3 billion or more in annual costs charged to the big private 
utilities. Reducing the amount paid to producers of renewable energy such as 
solar, wind and biomass power is considered a crucial step in keeping 
expected consumer rate hikes down.
?????And, after 40 days of dangerously low electricity supplies, the state 
got a reprieve Thursday morning when grid officials lifted the state's 
""electrical emergency"" status for the first time since Jan. 13.
?????So far, the state has spent nearly $2 billion buying electricity on 
behalf of the utilities, according to the Department of Finance, which 
informed the Legislature on Thursday that it will release another $500 
million for electricity purchases.

Energy Firms Won't Pay All of Monster Debt
PUC reverses, taxpayers could foot the bill 
Christian Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff Writer
Friday,?February 23, 2001 

 Under a ruling yesterday by state regulators, California taxpayers could be 
on the hook for hundreds of   millions of dollars in power purchases the 
state has made in behalf of two troubled utilities. 
The California Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously to absolve 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison of responsibility 
for any costs above the revenue they collect from ratepayers. 
The ruling reversed a position taken earlier by the commission, which had 
said the utilities were responsible for making up the difference between the 
state's costs and their own revenue. 
John Tremaine, a PG&E spokesman, said the funding needed to make up the 
difference could come in the form of a surcharge imposed on customers who use 
130 percent of the baseline amount of electricity. That is one option under a 
bill passed last month by the Legislature, he said. 
But Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor does 
not believe the money will come from ratepayers' electric bills. The costs, 
Maviglio said, could be covered by the $10 billion bond measure the state 
recently issued to cover power purchases. 
As California tries to resolve its power crisis, state officials are working 
out the precise way that should be done. 
Under the state's deregulation plan approved in 1996, the utilities have been 
forced to absorb skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs while being 
prevented by law from passing the increases on to customers through higher 
rates. 
Since the California Department of Water Resources began buying power last 
month, details showing how it will be repaid, how much or by whom have not 
been established. 
Yesterday's PUC decision was an attempt to begin setting the repayment 
criteria. 
A precise accounting of how much money is at stake is impossible to determine 
at this point, officials said, because PG&E declines to release ratepayer 
revenue figures, and the state is refusing to say exactly how much it has 
spent buying power. Officials estimate the state will spend $2.3 billion by 
the beginning of March and Davis authorized the expenditure of $500 million 
more yesterday. 
The state's Department of Water Resources became the buyer of record on Jan. 
17 when the two utilities' credit was so damaged that they were no longer 
able to buy power. 
Both utilities had opposed the commission's previous position that they be 
responsible for all power costs. 
The PUC's shift yesterday was summed up by Commissioner Richard Bilas, who 
said he could not support holding the utilities responsible for the revenue 
shortfall. ""The DWR is not about to go bankrupt; the utilities are,"" he said. 
Yet consumer advocates downplayed the commission's ruling yesterday. Nettie 
Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, said the ruling only 
dealt with the narrow issue of who has to account for the revenue shortfall, 
and did not reach an overarching decision about who, ultimately, will be 
financially responsible for it. 
""This is not a huge deal,"" she said. 
The state has been buying the lion's share of its power in the real-time 
market run by the Independent System Operator since the demise of the longer- 
term California Power Exchange, said Jesus Arredondo, a spokesman for the 
exchange. 
The state has been paying premium prices because it is buying in a market 
that was designed to handle last-minute emergencies. 
The governor's office has been seeking cheaper, long-term power contracts 
with only modest results.

Small electric producers OK big price cut

By Ed Mendel 
STAFF WRITER 
February 23, 2001 

SACRAMENTO -- Legislators said yesterday that small generators who produce 
about 30 percent of the state's power have agreed to cut their power prices 
in half, an important step toward easing the electricity crisis. 
Negotiations continued on what Gov. Gray Davis has called the final step: the 
state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investor-owned 
utilities in exchange for paying off their huge debt. 
Meanwhile, the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the 
customers of the utilities grows. Officials gave notice that an additional 
$500 million will be needed in 10 days, bringing the total to $2.6 billion. 
But for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert 
yesterday due to power shortages. More power was available from other states, 
and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance resumed 
operation. 
Two legislators, Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, 
D-Boulder Creek, said they introduced legislation that sharply reduces the 
prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult negotiations. 
""Ultimately, this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its 
ratepayers by billions of dollars,"" said Battin, who represents eastern San 
Diego County. 
About half of the small generators use ""renewable"" technologies such as 
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass. The rest is ""co-generation,"" when fuel 
is used for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a by-product. 
The small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of California's 
power under a two-decade-old federal ""qualifying facilities"" program, which 
requires utilities to buy their power. 
Battin and Keeley said that under the bill, SB 47X, the average price for 
these QF contracts could drop from the current 17 cents per kilowatt-hour to 
about 8 to 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
""We believe that the rates are at least that low, if not lower,"" said Jan 
Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, which 
represents small and large generators. 
The small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable 
price for five years, avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state 
regulators might make a more unfavorable price cut. 
Much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the 
California border, which has soared this winter. The legislation spreads the 
price bench mark over a five-year period. 
""We encourage the Legislature to take quick action to approve SB 47X as 
quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis,"" Smutny-Jones 
said. 
He said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a 
portfolio of long-term contracts to purchase natural gas for some 
co-generators, lowering their production costs. 
The legislation was applauded as ""a major step forward"" by a group of small 
generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to take 
the utilities into bankruptcy. 
""We call on the Legislature and the governor to act on it immediately,"" said 
Chris Thompson, a spokesman for the group. 
Thompson said Southern California Edison continues to collect money from 
ratepayers, as the state buys power for its customers, but is not paying 
anything to the small non-polluting generators. 
A spokesman for a geothermal generator in El Centro, which filed a lawsuit 
seeking $45 million from Edison for power provided since November, welcomed 
the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers cheaper power. 
But Vince Signorotti, a spokesman for CalEnergy, said it would be ""premature"" 
to consider dropping the lawsuit. 
Battin and Keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the 
governor's attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of 
Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric in exchange 
for payment of their debt. 
As part of the governor's plan, the utilities would agree to provide low-cost 
power for five to 10 years from their generators, which provide about a third 
of the state's power. 
Davis aides are attempting to negotiate long-term contracts with generators 
for the remaining third of the power required by the state, sharply reducing 
the cost of buying power on the expensive spot market. 
But the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign 
long-term contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for 
previous power purchases. 
The state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since 
mid-January, rescinding a Stage 1 alert declared Wednesday. Grid operators 
made the change after increased power supplies became available. 
""The supply situation this week has gradually been improving,"" said Lorie 
O'Donley, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator, 
which manages most of the state's power supplies. 
However, she said the improvements shouldn't deter consumers from 
conservation. 
""It is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to 
remind everybody that we are looking at a long-term power supply situation 
here,"" she said. ""And the high-demand summer is just around the corner. So we 
would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts."" 
In San Francisco yesterday, state power regulators decided unanimously that 
the Department of Water Resources is responsible for buying any power that 
cash-strapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own -- no 
matter what price wholesalers are charging. 
But the PUC voted 3-2 against taking action that would have allowed the DWR 
to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help cover 
the cost of buying electricity. 
The state, through the DWR, was authorized by a recent law to buy power for 
the utilities. Edison and PG&E have such low credit ratings that no power 
companies will sell to them. SDG&E's rating is much better, but its debt also 
was mounting. 
The DWR purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities 
provide through their own generating plants and through existing long-term 
contracts. But the DWR has refused to buy power beyond a certain price. That 
means more last-minute power purchases on the expensive spot market. 
The utilities and the state had disagreed over how the DWR will be reimbursed 
-- whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars -- and the extent of its 
power-buying role. 
The author of the bill authorizing the long-term contracts, Assemblyman 
Keeley, said the legislation's intent was to fully cover the one-third of the 
power that utilities purchased on the spot market, either through extended 
contracts or through the state ISO.
Staff writer Karen Kucher and The Associated Press contributed to this 
report. "

Years riding
How often currently riding
type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
type of saddle preferred
age, height and weight


Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour
ride
on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like
to
know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the
four-hour ride, and prefers the beach.  How about an all-day ride in the

"Definitely clever!  I wish that I had thought of the changing the clock thing 
when the girls were younger and had slumber parties.  

I didn't know that there were computer games that work on higher level math

I wish that we could meet for lunch.  Keep me posted on Cara  -- I have 
called her a little more frequently lately in hopes that she would spill the 
beans, but no movement on that yet!  

I think that next week we will know the schedule of games when Meagan will be 
dancing.  She did not make the dance for the first try-out.  It was jazz;  
not her strong suit.  But she did make the dances for the next two try-outs:  
a kick rountine and a pom routine.  There are two more try outs -- one more 
for kick and one more for pom. Hopefully she will make both.  Each routines 
is danced at two games -- one at home and one away.  So if she makes the next 
two dances, then she will be in 8 out of 10 dances for the football season.  
I think that she would feel pretty good about that.  The last two try-outs 
will be next week.  I will keep you posted.  

Have a great weekend.  Love, Sally

Sally,

Wish we could meet downtown for lunch--if only we weren't in different

Bummer about Meagan--I agree that physics and precalc would be a killer.
You've probably looked into this but there are some great computer
""games/drills"" for math.  Brigeda does the early ones but there are some for
the heavy duty stuff as well...

Amanda must have aced that lock/locker and changing classes thing if she
loves her classes...

Brigeda doesn't start until the 21st.  It is always a strange week when all
the other kids (and her best friend) is in school--kind of waiting week but
we should be getting ready for her party.

GREAT IDEA:  I'm going to change the clocks in my house the night of the
slumber party--to 2 hour ahead.  So they can have their midnight swim and
snack (at 10pm!).  I don't know whether this makes me a creepy or clever
mom...

Let me know when you get Meagan's football schedule...Brigeda has been
moaning about wishing she was in Houston since we left...

Today is Cara's appt with the gyn/ob--maybe an announcement will be
forthcoming.

I'm meeting a guy I took my web certification classes with on Monday.  He
owns a design firm in Georgetown and has some freelance work.  It would be
great to be able to accelerate our return to solvency!

Talk to you soon...

That was always one of my favorites!  The old Parent Trap is always great

about the slumber party.  When does she start school?  Today is day #2 for
the girls --Amanda loves her classes.  Meagan thought that the first day
""sucked"".  I have been on the phone with her counselor and assistant
principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her
class selection.  Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she
signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!   I don't know what she was
thinking!!  Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive
enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 22
deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and
add a study hall.  She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars
class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which
is probably exactly what she needs.  I was prepared to go all the way to
the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but
luckily I didn't have to go that far.

to receive an offer.  I will forward this to Kevin and Kristin Gandy.  
Although they are responsible for Graduate recruiting at Cornell, perhaps it 
is possible for him to interview when they go on campus.

Kevin and Kristin,
Please see Vince's message below. Would it be possible for an undergraduate 
to interview while you are at Cornell?  Please let me know.

Charlene,

Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in 
the recruiting process.
His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a 
Super Saturday? I really want
to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting 
efforts.

All:

Attached is a draft of a term sheet for a financial resid-power spread option 
purchase by EPMI from FPL for NEPOOL.  I am hoping to share this term sheet 
with the customer sometime early-mid afternoon on Tuesday 9/26, so I'd 
appreciate any comments you all might have.  I will be out of the office in 
the morning at a customer meeting, but will be available by cell 978-314-5614 
or pager 877-246-3206 (i'll be in the car for a good 3-4 hours between 8 AM-2 
PM Eastern traveling to and from the mtg).   If you have trouble reaching me, 
please feel free to go through Joe Gordon at 5-8956; Joe is an Associate 
newly assigned to the Northeast mid-market team (Joe will only be around in 
the AM though).  

Some specific points I'd like to raise:

Oil price index/curve -- Pearce Hammond (structuring) and I spoke with Dave 
Botchlett (our resid trader) Monday about:  (1) the most appropriate resid 
oil index to use; and (2)  the ""correct"" resid curve consistent with that 
index.   Dave did not sufficiently answer these two questions, so I called 
Paul Racicot and asked him what he thought.  Paul suggested using the Platts 
Daily New York Harbor Resid Cargo Mean index (which i've included in the term 
sheet attached), as that was probably the most hedegable index.  Other 
alternitives that I am aware of include Platts Daily New York Harbor Barge 
Mean and perhaps others.    We have the daily option to ""dispatch"" the energy 
or not, so I think we want to use a daily oil index rather than a first of 
the month index, etc.  Paul Broderick - do you have any thoughts on this?  
Assuming the Cargo Mean is the right index, we then need to make sure the 
resid curve we use is consistent with that index.  Pearce - could you perhaps 
connect with Dana/Paul Broderick/Ed Baughman/Joe Gordon to see if we can come 
to aggreement on index and appropriate curve.
Resid-power coorelation -- Dana - what coorelation do you want to assume;  
Pearce, please connect with Dana to confirm that number.
Janice/Ed -- if it's not evident, this proposed transaction is with the 
unregulated marketing sub of Florida Power & Light, not the regulated 
utility.  We have done other trades with this entity so I'm assuming we're 
all set with Master Agreement, etc.  Does our basic Master cover financial 
structures like the one outlined in the attached?

Any comments/feedback you have would be much appreciated.  Thanks

Regards
John

Dear Mr. Skilling,

On behalf of Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr. (San Francisco), it is my
pleasure to invite you to meet with him regarding energy issues in
California.

Mayor Brown wishes to meet with you in his capacity as a trustee of the
Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement

delegation of trustees to meet with the CEOs of CalPERS' largest energy
holdings.  Enron represents one such holding.

The Mayor would be pleased to host you in his office at the newly
renovated City Hall in San Francisco or arrange an alternative location at
your earliest convenience.  I
will await your response.

Sincerely,

Monique Moyer

Hello Steve,  I hope you and your family had a great holiday.  Steve, I heard 
on a talk show that the Bush Energy Policy would tackle such topics as 
Alaskan Gas, ANWR and also would mention the Powder River coal bed methane 
play.  I would like to get a copy of the Energy Policy when it becomes 
available.   I would also like everyone to be aware of the large investments 
made and planned by Northern Border Partners in the Powder River and Wind 
River Basins of Wyoming.  In addition, the Denver office of Enron North 
America has a large stake in gas trading in the Rockies.   Everything 
considered, the development of Rocky Mountain gas reserves, including the 
gathering and pipeline infrastructure will be less controversial than ANWR 
and will get gas to markets much sooner.  For example, Northern Border 
Partners expects to file at the FERC by the 3rd quarter of 2001 for the Bison 
Pipeline project which will connect Powder River reserves to NBPL in 2003 
(versus 2007 for Alaskan gas).  You can see the latest on the Bison project 
at Inside FERC, December 18th page 5.

One pending federal action that would do much to enhance coal bed methane 
production, is the completion of an EIS  presently being prepared by the 
BLM.   The timely issuance of a favorable EIS would open thousands of federal 
acres in Wyoming and Montana to drilling by coal bed methane producers and 
would assist gas in getting to market within Bush's first term in office.    
I hope Enron and the new administration can set Powder River gas as a 
priority item in the coming year !"

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  ""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind,"" he said. ""The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators.""

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a ""blind pig could
make money"" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  ""It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it,"" Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP ""an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers.""

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

Jeff & Mona:  We have confirmed that our contracts are silent on the issue.  
Question remains as to what the language of the original decision was...Can 
you suggest someone who can dig into this for us?  Should I just phone Mike

Subject: SDG&E Credits

Likely needs to be a legal analysis based on the language of the original 
decision etablishing the credits.  But seems to me that we have a deal with 
our customers to receive service according to price, terms and conditions 
stated in our contracts with those customers, and that the contract language 
would govern how the credit is treated.  If  the contracts don't speak to the 
issue of credits, seems that our contract agrees to provide rez customers 
with service for a a certain price, and as such, it would be up to us whether 
we flow it through.  But a lawyer, I am not.  Are our contracts silent on the 
issue?

Best,
Jeff

Diane Huddelston called Lori Pinder about an issue;  Here it is:

Due to the merger btw SDG&G & Sempra Energy (about a year or less ago), a 
savings was realized.  The CPUC said these savings must be passed on to 
customers 1 time per year, in September.  They are called Annual Merger 
Credits.

Pursuant to all commercial contracts, Enron is entitled to keep the savings 
(per Diane).  What about the residential customer accounts?

Enron keeps the savings or should the residential customer receive?

Who could handle this issue for Diane?

Thanks, KC

You probably know this, but the most important stuff is:

assignment

scope (if available), schedule guarantees
option price not credited against purchase price (and lately, not refundable)

I thought you've been saying Financial are largely 2-way but a few are 1-way and we would need to check for those.  Now ""financial contracts are 1-way.""  I'm confused.

As we move forward with CPs we need to know weather there is 1-way or 2-way termination payment methodology in the contract.  (Plan is to add a column to our spreadsheet to track this.)  You have mentioned that almost all CPs are 2-way.  What is the best approach to determining which CPs are 1-way versus 2-way?  

Additionally, there is other data we need to complete our spreadsheet, such as:
Contract type (ISDA, GTC, other)
Global contract number
What are your thoughts on getting this information?

Dear Sara,

Thank you for recently visiting ShareBuilder and opening your new account!
I hope you're excited to put the benefits of ShareBuilder to work in your
investment portfolio.  Regular investing over time can help you build wealth
with the stocks you believe in.

With ShareBuilder, we have made it easy by setting no account or investment
minimums; you simply choose which stocks you want to invest in, how often
you would like to invest (weekly, monthly or on a one-time basis), and how
you would like to fund your account.

Investors have already begun to accumulate some of the biggest name stocks.
Below are the most popular companies chosen by thousands of ShareBuilders
over the last few weeks:

1. Cisco - CSCO
2. Microsoft - MSFT
3. America Online - AOL
4. Nasdaq-100 - QQQ
5. Wal-Mart - WMT
6. Intel - INTC
7. Home Depot - HD

While ShareBuilder does the work for you, it can't start a recurring
dollar-based investment plan until you create a ShareBuilder Plan and specify 
how
you want to fund your account.  I would like to encourage you to complete
your ShareBuilder Plan at http://www.sharebuilder.com!

Once you've completed your ShareBuilder Plan you only need to choose a
funding option to begin investing.  We offer three easy ways to fund your
ShareBuilder Plan: automatic transfers from your checking account, automatic

In order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with t=

Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, =

organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale=20
Services.  NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under=

John Gillis, President.

With the majority of EE&CC and OEC=01,s activities focused on assets and=20

of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports.  While EEOS will be a=

stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely=

with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports.

This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabiliti=

Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units=20
which they support. =20

With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wid=

that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design,=20
construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron=01,s assets=

"I just talked to Bob, and I don't know if he's responded yet, but I thought 
I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation 
about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet. 
I've reminded him and he said he WILL talk to the guy and resolve it today. 
I'll keep on it, and let you know when these deals have been changed.

Thanks,

Hello, I hate to bug you with this.  Whenever you can spare a second would 
you ask Bob about this?  I am afraid it is going to slip through the cracks.

Thanks for your help!

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa

"tomorrow is absolutely horrible for me.  let's talk in the am.  perhaps you 
and mona, sue and sandi can cover sans moi."
"Hey - what the heck is zero week? I might be interested in signing up for 
that - pack in some quick credits for my pre-grad school work. I figured out 
I'm going to essentially have to get a second bachelor's degree before going 
to grad school. But hey, it's all about the credentials man - as in, being 
able to tell people at my 10-year high school reunion that I have two 
bachelor's degrees, a master's, and a Rhodes Scholarship to study Italian 
wine in a 12th century villa, surrounded by buff, tan, and unusually 
good-looking farm workers.Tres important! 

So yeah, maybe we'll hold off on the visit for now. I think it's more 
important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right 
now - then we party! I could maybe make it out there in April, overlap with 
mom's trip (I don't think I could handle the whole thing with her...) - I'll 
keep it in mind. And yeah, she's giddy about this whole house move thing. I 
hope it works out for the best - I really think it will. I'm starting to feel 
really bad about leaving Kitty with her, but I'm in a weird situation with 
Amber's cat at our house already. Part of me wants to just bring Kitty over 
and tell everyone to deal with it because it's my house too; but the other 
part of me doesn't want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between 
her and Amber's outmatched feline. Oh well, I'm thinking about it. 

The most excitement I'll be having this week is my haircut with Brett 
tonight. I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt, a totally extraneous 
and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I hadn't insisted on 
getting a ""real"" house with a ""real"" bed and all that other crap that goes 
along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise 
spent on beer. And as the sands flow, these are the days of our lives....

I'm so impressed with your dating maneuvers. I told Amber and Molly about it 
last night at dinner, which we ate together around our new dining room table, 
and they both said in unison, ""Like sister, like sister."" I guess I have some 
kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters - go figure. Anyway, 
it's time for me to go find something to eat and then come back to my desk 
and consume it while it flows directly to my butt. Can't wait! Write back 
soon.

Subject: RE:


I'm so glad to hear everything's better at your house!  I totally want to
come visit, but my last two paycheck deposits have only raised the balance
to $0 so it may be awhile.  I'm definitely coming in June, when I take a
zero week class in Eugene.  Mom's supposedly coming out here in April and we
might go to Glenwood Springs (hot springs, spa, MASSAGES!).  You should
come, too!  Fun female family bonding time!

I am so excited for Dad to visit, not just because of the car but also
because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about 100%.
I'm a little worried about the effect it's having on Mom, who asked me when
he was coming so she wouldn't ""run into him"".  Like I would allow that to
happen - how stupid does she think I am?  But it sounds like she's pretty
stoked about this house thing, so I'm excited for her.

I have a date with that waiter guy tonight, but I'm not really that excited
because I am fat, ugly and on the third day of my period.  Did I mention
broke and car-less?  I think I should just put off this whole dating thing
until I increase MY net value (to use Kate-speak), which is just ground zero
for most people.  I am trying to pay off some debt (Dad took care of most of
it, but I didn't have the heart to show him my Nordstrom account).  It's
slow-going, though.  And car payments will not make it easy, but seriously
this city is so pedestrian-unfriendly that I feel I have no choice.  I tried
to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the
shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes.  And every person in Denver feels
the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby (I
am SO afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a Doberman).
So I need a car,  and I don't care if it means weekly visits to the plasma
""donation"" center.

I actually met Marky's ex the other night (maybe don't mention to Amber - I
don't know why but the whole thing seems weird and I would rather stay out
of it).  Anyway, she is really cool!  She reminds me of my friend Jen
Sturmer, except less anorexic and depressed.  Speaking of, have you been
going out in Portland a lot?  I miss Veritable Quandary!  I haven't found
anything like that here yet.  Downtown has some cool bars, but you have to
pay $90 plus an appendage to park and cabs are not cheap either.  My
neighborhood has some good dives, like the one on our corner that has a
flickering neon sign outside announcing ""Don's Mixed Drinks"" - not sure, but
think that's the name of the bar.  I went in once and met Don, the king of
multiple body piercings here in Denver.

Okay, I'm rambling.  Time to get back to work (which is so good lately, by
the way!  I get to start grant-writing this month!).  Hope all's well for
you.  I'll give you the dirt on my date later, if my acne doesn't scare him
away in minute one.  Miss you, love you!!

Love, yo sista

Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck
in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are
going really well though (Rocky Mountain ""highs"") and that you've made it
through most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain
""lows""). Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour,
he mentions how they've got to get together with you when she comes to town
- which will be on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets
to go and I don't, being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of
college and therefore do not enjoy such things as ""Spring Break Mania""
anymore. And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that she'd
love to hang out with you more often. It sounds like you guys had a ball at
dinner, eh? So you've got options, girlfriend, which is worlds more than I
can say for my life at the mo'. It pretty much consists of working, eating,
and sleeping. I'm definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing,
because I think it's got me in its clutches. But the recent abundance of
sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life
after winter. We're doing lots of gardening, cooking, and decorating at the
house - it's like having three Martha Stewarts all working together, only
slightly less stylish , immensely less efficient, and drunk. Other than
that, I've been trying to organize and simplify my life - taking care of
mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, sorting out all those nagging little
post-it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain.
I'm actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, like maybe
I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months, or even buy a SECOND pair
of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy just yet. So I heard Dad and
Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile. That
is, in the immortal words of the guys in ""Dude, where's my car?"", SWEET...
DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load off - just make sure to
keep your finances in check and not get in over your head. Take it from one
who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old beater car; but then I
start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and suddenly $30,000 doesn't
seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. Lately I've been doing
a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I just applied for
post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking economics and
poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from work!) I'm
also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get serious
about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies and/or
economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found my
dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a
two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington
and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does
it get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for
government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in
my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not
getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it,
dude. As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so
much energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as
I'm having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By
the time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in
100 million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest
paragraph of my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a
thrilling tour of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in
exchange for a finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the
information for it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever
make it home for a weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray
is coming to the Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your
concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me
soon if you can, or I'll call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!

Love,
Kate

Hey Lady!

What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long.
You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met
while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like
Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see
that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so
fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And
now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr.
Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In
fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news
about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home.
How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with
the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited
than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm
getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day.
Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I
have
to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to
afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you!

Greetings Professor:

Our group consists of Jeff Dasovich, Mark Guinney, Anil Sama and Carolyn
Vavrek.

We propose to examine the recently failed acquisition by Coke of Quaker
Oats:  Why merge?  What was the value?  Upside?  Downside?  Why did it go
bust?  Should it have gone through?  What's up with this Buffet guy,
anyway?

If you have any concerns with this proposal, please let us know.

Finally, if possible, we'd like to present on Thursday, April 26th.

Best,
Jeff

Miss Tana,

Are you interested in going to the Nutcracker Market this Saturday morning
and being there for the early bird special (8 a.m.)??  It costs $25 to get
in early, but that covers $10 admission, $5 parking, coffee and
refreshments.  Otherwise, you can go at 10 a.m., pay $10 to get in with the
rest of the crowd and $5 for parking.  I think I am going to plan to be
there around 7:40-7:45.  Let me know if you are interested.

Patti

Hi Jim: 

As we discussed, your client, the California Independent System Operator, 
contracted with MCI to build a high-speed, broad band network (predominately 
OC-48?)as the platform to launch electricity deregulation in California.  
Since that time, the ISO has discovered that it has capacity substantially in 
excess of what it needs to operate the grid (and certain markets for power, 
e.g., ancillary services).  

Rather than try to re-negotiate the contract with MCI, the ISO is now looking 
at marketing the capacity.  Sounds like the capacity runs between Sacramento 
(Folsom?) and Southern California (Alhambra?).  Please correct any 
(unintended) inaccuracies I may have included in this very brief description.

Tom Gros is VP of Enron's global bandwidth trading group and can help 
determine the value/feasibility of having the ISO make use of Enron's 
bandwith trading platform.

Tom, meet Jim.  Jim, meet Tom

Best,
Jeff

"whadup! i'm so happy for you re: the love thing. love is sooooo in the air 
lately. molly just fell head over heels for some cowboy dude evan introduced 
her to. they've been attached at the hips, literally, for the last three 
weeks. and amber spends about four quality hours a day on the phone with 
marky, then cries when she has to hang up. seriously. but your romance sounds 
much more interesting - you absolutely have to keep me posted on how it 
unfolds. and what's the guy's name anyway? you know what's weird is that last 
night after my haircut i met up with molly and her man for dinner. we decided 
to check out the brazen bean, this little swanky cigar bar across the street 
from the blue moon on 21st. (we heard they had a martini happy hour, and we 
felt like pretending we were sophisticated.) so we're walking into the place 
when molly suddenly remembers that she knows the people who live upstairs 
(it's in one of those old rambling victorian houses) so she runs upstairs to 
say hi and then comes back down with them. it turns out to be blake and jill, 
this really sweet couple i've met before, friends of friends, you know how it 
goes. anyway, we all end up staying longer than we should and having more 
martinis than we planned on, and then blake remembers his friend dave was 
coming over to watch a movie. so he runs upstairs to meet dave and brings him 
back down. well dave happens to be amazingly cute and have amazingly great 
legs (he had just come from the gym and was amazingly good about sitting in 
this dimly lit velvet-couched candle-lit shi-shi joint in shorts and a 
sweatshirt). so dave, molly tells me as she begins to put the hard sell on 
IMMEDIATELY (i've noticed as i get older and stay single that many of my 
friends feel the need to try vehemently to get me coupled), plays the guitar 
amazingly and has an amazing voice. i find out over the course of the evening 
that he also reads A LOT and is interested in irish literature and quantum 
physics. well, who isn't, y'know. he also likes to sail - and this is really 
quite scary - LASER SAILBOATS. yep. i've officially met my father in a 
younger form. barf. anyway, he and blake and i all had a jolly time talking 
about books and parents and that show blind date. it was all very 
intellectual, i assure you. what was weirder still was that every time i said 
something, dave looked at blake and kind of laughed. and every time i was 
like, stop your laughing or i'll beat you senseless, and he was like, no i'm 
just laughing because we were just talking about that the other day or 
because i've done that or because i'm doing that next week. i said i wanted 
to start a book club - apparently he suggested that to blake two days ago. i 
said i lived in italy and wanted to go back - he's going there in two months. 
oh, and then there's our common love of running. okay, i'm rambling, so i'll 
get to the point, which is that in my single and cynical state i didn't think 
much of the poor guy last night, but today i've noticed i'm increasingly 
interested and, i'll admit, maybe even attracted. so as we were leaving i 
kind of waved goodbye and said see ya around, because you always do in an 
incestuous vat such as portland, and went on my merry way with molly and 
josh, which i'm sure they were happy about since they practically tried to 
push me into dave's car and run away. dave got in his car and drove off, then 
all of a sudden appeared in front of us as we were crossing the street to our 
car. he had driven around the block and was now getting out of his car to 
give me his card, which he handed to me under the pretense that we couldn't 
start a book club without each other's contact information. i already knew he 
worked at a running store, whatever that is, but when i turned the card over 
it had his name on it and the word ""owner"" underneath. do you think that 
means he's the actual owner? or is it one of those places like les schwab 
where they give all the employees stock options and call them ""employee 
owners""? i'm going to look into it. now i'm probably making way too much of 
this because he was probably like, yeah i need some more members for my book 
club but i definitely don't want to talk to this drinking, smoking, lump of 
unmolded flesh for any other reason....why would i, the proprietor of a 
running store and owner of such amazing legs, do a thing like date a girl who 
shudders at the thought of exercise and loses weight only when she ups her 
alcohol consumption to the point where she forgets to eat? that would just be 
silly. okay, i've got to go. get back to me with a detailed account of your 
evening such as the one i just sent you.

"I agree with you 100%.  I hope that Mike can make it clear to John that it is 
never appropriate to criticize another department - whether Legal or anyone 
else - in such a public manner.  If he feels there is a problem that should 
be corrected, he should proceed through proper channels.  In this case, a 
direct one-on-one conversation with Andrea strikes me as the most obvious 
route and if that is not possible, not productive or just too awkward, he 
should have approached either you or Mike.  Sending out an e-mail that might 
be considered personally critical of Andrea in such a public way is clearly 
contrary to our core value of Respect.  I hope you are able to have some 
input into the review process for John and this should certainly be 
mentioned.  If you need my help in any way, please let me know."

FYI...

Jeff Shankman and Fred Lagrasta are trying to change Enron's Tape Retention 
Policy from four months to forever on a number of individuals in their 
group.  Due to the inner workings of our recording system, selective tape 
retention is impossible.  It is a all or none type of situation.  Please 
review this email and our current Tape Retention Policy and decide what 
course of action is needed.  As you know this email is not enough to 
permanently stop the company's retention policy.  A new policy would need to 
be drafted and signed by John Lavorato and yourself before this could occur.

If you have any questions, please call me at 853-4764

Sara:

Any chance you are available at 1:30pm on Wednesday for a call regarding the
Enron/Corrugated Services ISDA?  If that time will not work for you, please
suggest another time tomorrow afternoon that would.

Also, you will be receiving on Thursday morning a copy of some of the more
relevant documentation relating to the June 2000 drop down of the Corrugated
Services, Inc. operating assets and liabilities (including the original
Enron/Corrugated Services, Inc. ISDA) into a newly formed limited
partnership known as Corrugated Services, L.P.  In connection with that
transaction, Corrugated Services, Inc. changed its name to CSI Holdings,
Inc.  CSI Holdings, Inc. also formed at that time and now owns 100% of CSI
GP, Inc., which entity serves as the general partner of Corrugated Services,
L.P.  All of this was done to create a more franchise tax efficient
operating and ownership structure.

Based on the foregoing, we believe that it will be necessary to redocument
the original agreement either through an amendment thereto or the
cancellation thereof and the creation of a new LP/Enron agreement.

We plan on discussing the foregoing during our call tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks.

Dear Mr.Viverito

Attached Word file is ISDA draft amended by our legal desk.
(please take the amended points as our comment on your draft)
Please check it all and kindly reply ASAP.
(CSA is not acceptable as I mentioned you before, and we'll check your
LETTER OF CREDIT after
the schedule is almost agreed)

In your draft, we cannot understand the meaning of ""EDGAR"" on page4,
so please show us what it is.

We are very hoping to conclude this process rapidly.
So, I very much appreciate it if you could send back your comment before
Holiday in U.S.(4th Sep)
(it's ok if only the rough prospects of concluding ISDA)

Best regards,

Subject:	RE: Franchise Players and the Draft

The snake thing is good and bad.   But I think the first round should be
randomly selected for ALL teams because the current way gives those not
keeping a franchise player a double benefit by picking in the supplemental
and then also at the top of the first round.   Theoretically the non keeper
teams are getting the 8-14 best players who are arguably also franchise
players.  In effect by not keeping a player you are randomly selecting a
lower level franchise player.  So they shouldn't get the an automatic shot
at 15-22 or whatever it might be as well.  So snake or no snake all of round
one should be random order.

"Steve,

The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication
than RISK MAgazine.

If the article is published it will give you more exposure in 
the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant
accomplishment.

On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK
among the practitioners.

I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

Good Afternoon Sara,

I wanted to document our discussion this afternoon regarding the Early 
Termination Letter for our Deal No. M368796 that settled on 2/2/01, with the 
Bank of Montreal. You stated that the Master ISDA Agreement states that the 
valuation method for early termination should be the process of obtaining 
Market Quotations from Reference Market Makers. This Early Termination Letter 
reflects that BMO determined the value through its ordinary valuation methods 
instead. This was agreed upon by, the trader, Ellen Su. Therefore, you 
provided your approval for us to execute this letter. Please respond with 
your agreement for our files.

Many Thanks,

"Francisco,

You should have gotten my email back to Justin.

 We have two sets of online customers coming thru, one set that originates 
from Houston Credit and one set originates from London Credit.  We are 
responsible for responding for Houston Credit based customers, and London 
Legal for London based customers.

A side issue to all of this is how we gather legal advice on trading around 
the world.  We don't want to duplicate efforts and costs by having both 
Houston and London Legal Departments requesting separate advice.  Our office 
is responsible for legal advice in the Americas and Southeast Asia, while 
London leads the efforts in Europe .  After we each receive advice we provide 
copies and communicate to each other the advice received.  Even though we 
both receive the same legal advice, sometimes we don't always agree on the 
approach in a particular country, and at the end of the day, each Legal Dept. 
is responsible for their own clients.

As far as the advice on Mexico, Chile and Argentina, as I told Justin, the 
advice I have received from the Houston lawyers is that although we can 
transact financial products in these countries, we have certain legal risks 
in doing so, and we need to do corporate due diligence to check their 
appropriate corporate documents to see if they are allowed to do these, and 
further, most of these counterparties have not filed consents to service of 
process here in the U.S., which we require in order to trade with us.  Since 
what these counterparties usually want to trade are physical products, we 
don't waste our time doing the due diligence at this point.  If a 
counterparty really wanted to trade financial we would spend the time 
resolving those issues.

As you become the responsible lawyer, first in Mexico, and maybe in the rest 
of South America, you may have a different opinion on these issues and we can 
certainly change our policies at any time.  All of the above is just what my 
current direction is from our lawyers.

Hi Francisco

Just so that I can inform the rest of my team and the marketing people - why 
is it that we require Masters with Mexican counterparties and not with 
counterparties from other countries?  Would it make any difference if the 
Enron Entity was in the UK like Enron Metals Limited rather than US?

Does this apply for offline trading as well?

 I am the ""new"" lawyer in charge of our financial trading operations in 
Mexico.

I am told that we do not trade financial with any Mexican counterparty 
without going through our normal due diligence process.  At the end of the 
day we need a Master in place with any Mexican counterparty with whom we 
trade (financial) online or otherwise.  I checked and we do not have a Master 
in place with this counterparty.

Subject: The Enron Corporate Policy Committee Retreat

Ken and Jeff have decided that the Enron Executive Committee Retreat will 
include only the Corporate Policy Committee this year.  (See list of members 
below.)  You may be holding the timeframe of January 16-18, 2001 on your 
calendar, which you can now free up if you are not on the committee.

The location of the retreat is under consideration.  When a decision is made, 
we will get the information to the members of the Corporate Policy 
Committee.  Departure for the retreat will be early afternoon on Tuesday, 
January 16 with return to Houston late afternoon on Thursday, January 18.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions at 713-853-6088.

Vince,

Sean tells me that the structured deal libraries, probably requires a more thorough hand-over....

...do we have that expertise still in the building?... can we extend someone here to make that happen?

regards

Steve

PS: I hope you and your wife can attend on Saturday 6pm?.... is there anything you both can't eat? (vegetarian etc...)

Monday and plan to be there through Thursday.  Much of my time will be spent 
with Fernley and Mike Jordan.  

If you have a few minutes while I am in town, it would be great to get with

you in supporting the continuing growth of your business in 2001.  I will

Good Afternoon Tana;

     Can you provide me with some quick information?

 My traders entered into a transaction with the above group via London and I
need to scurry to get the ENRON CORP. PARENT GUARANTY AMENDED TO INCLUDE THIS
ENTITY (provided I have the correct name).

Do I have the correct entity name? Can we do AN AMENDMENT TODAY? I would like 
to
get it amended today so as not to have to break the trade?

In addition, if you could give me the Legal Contact Person in London for the
above named entity with phone and fax numbers it would be very helpful.

If you can assist, thanking you most kindly in advance. With kind regards.

It's Friday, and I'm here settling Nymex.  I got a phone call from Evelyn Wednesday before Thanksgiving to come in today.  It's o.k.  I don't mind.  I get Monday off.  Just a few notes to let you know what's going on.  EDF Mann, Paribas and Carr Futures London pulled a fast one.  They set the margin at 150% more of what it would have been.  Here are the numbers incoming and outgoing.

        OUTGOING                

                Smith Barney Financial                  $232,499.00 
                Paribas                                 $46,026,588.00 
                EDF Mann                                $760,515.00 
                Carr Futures                            $12,331,010.66 

        INCOMING 

                ABN Amro                                $33,852.00 
                Saul Stone                              $19,800.00 
                HSBC                                    $291,325.00 
                HSBC Canada                             No Margin Call 
                R. J. Obrien                            $12,320.00 
                J.P. Morgan                             $292,827.00 
                Credit Suisse                           $200,261.00 
                

Lori at Smith Barney was not in Friday, so we did not settle.  

FIMAT was not in, and the numbers came out like this.  They were supposed to have paid down on the loan by $2,931,087.24.  I don't know how you handle this.  Hopefully they will do this on Monday.

I know this is a terrible welcome back, but it was something that had to be done.  "
"Basic summary for Teco:

Still working with Finance Group to come up with different finance structures.
Working with Insurance group (weather desk) to wear the risk of the project, 
since the Power desk will not wear that type of risk.
Pricing of the put, call and spread option values is still not finalized, 
because Kevin Presto has said that he does not put much value into these 
plants in Eastern PJM
Don Black is beginning to look at other companies for his price risk 
management product.  
He feels he will not be able to get a deal done with Teco at this point in 
time.

Let me know if this is suffient for your analysis.

"It is hard for me to say how this would work on behalf of all of my direct

at 3:00, you all would have to leave around 2:30, which could be early in the 
day for some groups to lose assistants.    Would it work to start a little 
later in the afternoon?  If before 5:00, I think that all assistants will 
have to check with their managers on the convenience of an earlier departure

Hi Sally
Hope you had a great Easter!
Are you okay with us leaving the office early on Wed May 3rd?
Sometimes it is hard for some to break for lunch and others can't do a dinner 
after work.  I thought mtg at 3pm would be inbetween.  And give everyone a 
chance to relax without thinking about coming back to work.
I wanted to check with you before I asked for RSVP's.
Thank you

Hi Ladies,
If you don't know already, Patti Thompson (Sally's Assistant) is now an 
official Enron Employee!!!!  Yeah!!!!!  I couldn't be more pleased and would 
like to arrange a get together to welcome her to our group!  Plus, we haven't 
all gotten together for awhile!  Instead of having lunch or dinner, maybe we 
can meet in between.

 How about this? 
Little Papasito's (on Westhiemer and Kirby) or Tilah's (on West Dallas)
Wednesday, May 3rd
Meet at the restaurant at 3:00pm
There is one thing about this. . . .no returning to the office!
(It hasn't been decided whether to go to Papasito's or Tilah's, place your 
vote!)

I  would love to accommodate as many assistants as possible.  So if this 
conflicts with many of your schedules, we can be flexible on the date.
Please let me know what you think as soon as you can.  I'll keep everyone 
posted!
Lynn

Per your request, here is what we have decided:

1. Our 2 best candidates were Jackie McCoy and Samantha Boyd.  As I mentioned 
to you, Mark will be talking to HR about making an offer to Samantha Boyd but 
until she formally accepts, we don't want to lose Jackie or say anything to 
her.

2. We have passed on the following candidates:

Stephanie Panus
Patricia Slaughter
Donald Duhon
Debra Vincent


Of this group, we may pass on to other groups that have expressed interest  
to Mark Taylor in hiring for a non-legal position, the resumes of Stephanie 
Panus and Debra Vincent and certainly Jackie McKoy if Samantha accepts.  It 
would be helpful to know from you when these particular  passed over 
candidates have been notified so that we don't cause confusion if we send 
their resume elsewhere.

Also, do you have references for Samantha? 

Please call me if you need any additional information.

Power purchase bills exceed $7.5 billion 
Published Tuesday, July 10, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY MARK GLADSTONE, NOAM LEVEY AND DION NISSENBAUM 

Mercury News Sacramento Bureau 


SACRAMENTO -- Six months after jumping into the electricity business, the 
Davis administration on Monday provided the first detailed glimpse of 
California's daily power purchases, showing more than $5 billion in payments, 
much of it to government-owned utilities and private companies that state 
officials have branded as price gougers. 
The state spent an additional $2.5 billion on a variety of contracts and 
other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy markets, 
according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a 
legal dispute over public access to the data. 
In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2 
billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for 
electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro 
in British Columbia. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power. 
The documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have 
arisen around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of the 
state's purchases have come from government-run power generators in 
California and elsewhere, but not Texas; some of the biggest suppliers are 
from the Northwest. 
Gov. Gray Davis, who has ambitions to run for the White House, has put much 
of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in 
President Bush's home state. 
The figures are tucked inside 1,770 of pages of invoices that Davis has 
resisted divulging, saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge 
more. The state, which last month released information on its long-term 
electricity contracts worth $43 billion, agreed Thursday to release the first 
quarter details. 
Short on explanation 
The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Water 
Resources, which buys power for the state's financially strapped major 
utilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the 
price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for 
what prompted the decrease. 
In January, for instance, the average price for power on the spot market was 
$321 a megawatt hour. It peaked in April at $332 and dropped to $271 in May. 
One megawatt powers about 750 homes. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's 
assertions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the 
out-of-state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant 
shift of money out of California.'' 
But the documents fail to shed much light on whether, as the administration 
contends, the price drop was due to long-term power contracts negotiated by 
the state earlier this year. Critics contend that the Davis administration 
panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for 
many years. 
Used for support 
Republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks 
against Davis, a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power 
generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down, 
partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many 
plants. 
``It's more clear than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,'' 
said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt 
the ratepayers for the next five or 10 years.'' 
The newly released bills highlight the volatility of California's energy 
market, where the price per megawatt hour ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any 
given day, the records show, the prices from seller to seller varied widely, 
with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and 
companies outside Texas. 
On one day in February, for example, San Diego-based Sempra Energy was 
charging $165 per megawatt hour, the Eugene Water and Electric Board was 
charging nearly $500 and Duke Energy, a North Carolina company, was charging 
up to $575. 
The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million for all power, 
including the spot market and contracted power. 
The state began buying power in mid-January on behalf of the state's major 
utilities, which were unable to borrow money to buy power after amassing 
enormous debts for electricity. 
San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which is building several new power plants 
around California including one in South San Jose, did only $29 million worth 
of business with the state in the first five months of the year, according to 
the figures. 
The state began buying power in mid-January when Pacific Gas & Electric Co. 
and Southern California Edison Co. were on the ropes financially. PG&E later 
went into bankruptcy. 
On Monday, state lawmakers took another shot at trying to cobble together a 
plan to rescue financially ailing Edison. 
While most concede that a rescue plan Davis worked out with Edison will not 
win the necessary support in the Legislature, lawmakers have created several 
working groups to come up with alternatives. 
Compromise plan 
On Monday, state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Redwood City, unveiled the latest 
compromise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small 
businesses from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help 
finance the Edison bailout. 
The ``shared pain'' proposal would force power producers, owed about $1 
billion, to take a 30 percent ``haircut'' and agree to forgive about $300 
million in Edison debts. Edison would be asked to swallow $1.2 billion -- 
about a third of its debt. And big users would be asked to pay off the 
remaining $2 billion in debts, possibly by paying higher prices for power. 
In exchange, large companies would be given the opportunity to buy power on 
the open market, a system that would allow many of them to sign cheap energy 
deals. 
Sher presented the proposal to Senate Democrats Monday afternoon, but it 
remains unclear how much support the framework will receive in the 
Legislature.

Dear Ms. Williamson:

    Per an autoresponder from Yorleni Mendez, I am forwarding to you
what I sent to Enron & others a couple of days ago, which was in
supplement to what I sent on Feb. 6th.  Time is of the essence and not
on your side.  Nor are the facts & the law on your side.  Therefore, you
need to find a way to get us to be on your side.

    Due to the urgency and foreseeable and announced forthcoming event
horizons, I believe you may wish to provide copies of the attached to
the proper persons at Enron for their immediate attention.  Please let
them know that if I have to continue to give information & documents to
the U.S. Senate and the proper others, that I will do so and then also
show that the failure of Hughes interests/companies to take remedial
measures was indeed blatant refusal.  We have already logged where
Hughes companies/interests have been to
http://willgriffin.com/hughes.htm thus you might as well continue to
visit there and see where we have posted changes and new information.
The knowledge of the Hughes companies/interests of these matters is now
clearly established.  We've already submitted some of our visitor logs
and other documents to the proper others, establishing the knowledge of
Hughes companies/interests to others.  This is something I am sure will
be most meaningful to the lawyers, along with a few other things I'm
sure which will get their attention..

    Also please have someone forward the attached to William Rice
Lummis, James A. Baker and others and advise them that surprises,
attention getters & wake-up calls are just around the corner.  They need
to contact us soon, before it becomes improper to discuss how a
reasonable (fanny & facing-saving) resolve for Hughes
interests/companies may be achieved.

in the news as being the biggest beneficiary of the California energy
woes, while also being the largest contributor, fund-raiser and general
benefactor to President George W. Bush.
http://www0.mercurycenter.com:80/premium/business/docs/enron07.htm
Another article goes even further showing the relationship of James
Addison Baker III to Enron and Hughes ""Bush's Biggest Donors Gain From
High Prices in California Crunch""
http://www.villagevoice.com:80/issues/0106/ridgeway3.shtml

    You may wish to re-visit the updated
http://willgriffin.com/hughes.htm (refesh/reload the page to clear your
browser's cache of the previous copy) after reviewing the news articles
links about Enron provided above.  You should know and reasonably
foresee that you are not the only visitors to my Hughes pages.  You
should also know that I've had contact with the proper authorities and
this to include correspondences within this past week.  Then again, I'm
sure many in the pipeline of those who review this and my previous
advisory know this to be true, or to reasonably foresee the interest of
many others at a minimum.

    I believe you to foresee more to soon become public difficulties for
you and that the intensity will no doubt increase significantly.  You
should know that any political related problems will include Democrats
in volumes, but there exists quite a few Republicans who will disavow
and distance themselves from you.  The China-Hughes missile & satellite
technology transfers, that were cited in the Cox Committee report, and
the arming of Sadaam Hussein with Hughes technologies issues are about
to pop up their heads and see a longer shadow than the groundhog
recently did.  This, in addition to the recent articles about Enron,
current activities and forthcoming event horizons, is not good news for
Hughes interests.

    You just might want to ask William Rice Lummis and James A. Baker
III, et. al. how they intend to solicit the help of the guy who holds
the keys to resolve, who they've got a little miffed at them, because of
what was done to him in an ad hominem attempt.  Certainly, when it is
true that if he now does nothing and a profound correlation exists
between how bad things go for you and how good things go as a result for
him, then why should he help y'all?  It appears if you ask Mr. Baker
about the Matter of Hughes and how we hold the keys to an amiable
resolve, that he will stipulate that it will take some real ""Politics of
Diplomacy"" to persuade us to help you, but that this needs to be
urgently accomplished.

my humble opinion are quite troubling statements, particularly when those

Dude,

Thanks for the abalone last night. Too bad we had to wash it down with that 
discussion. Actually, wasn't so bad, really -- just a bit frusterating. 
Anyway, let me know what I can do for Prentice's birthday. Do you want me to 
go out there and check it out? Let me know about deposits and stuff like 
that as well.

I'm sitting here in the new place in the 'Loin listening to that great

out and organizing all my papers.

Hope you're having a good day.

Stella:

The Swift deal is not pathed correctly in POPS.  I set up an accounting 
arrangement on the 012-41500-02-015 contract with the Track ID 80705.  Would 
you put the contract in POPS with the associated Track ID?  

The transportation contract (012-41500-02-003) for the Liquids Replacement 
gas is not POPS.  I looked in Path Manager and there is no deal for it 
either.  In December, the deal for this gas was 114096.  Could you extend the 
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one?  I need to set up 
an accounting arrangement so I will need for you to verify the deal number 
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on.  When I set 
up the accounting arrangement I will let you know what the Track ID is so you 
can put the contract at meter 9643.

Let me know when all of this is done so that I can reallocate the meter.

Thanks,

Fred

Jeff--so what is a state librarian?  Must be a west coast kind of specialty!!

With regard to Glen Thomas, I believe that he is the newly appointed chair who was previously Governor Tom Ridge's policy guy in the governor's office. I think he is pretty young (early thirties) and that he still has strong ties in that office and should be vocal on markets working and political leadership (the right kind!) being neccesary.  Steffes might be able to give you more insight, but if my recollection is right, he wasn't involved in the early PECO fights--I think he came on the scene a little later.

On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, ""Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California.""

I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: ""Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation.""

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:

Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
Bob Foster--Edison
Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
State Senator Debra Bowen
David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Please see comments on PG&E strategy.  I have made some modifications to be 
more consistent with the three main messages of the ISO MSC report dated 
9/6/00.  Any proposal should address the three messages of this report 1) 
Eliminate mandatory UDC day ahead purchase requirement from PX (this may 
allow generators to exercise mkt power during time periods of high demand) 
and allow utilities to hedge forward purchases in bilateral markets at 
shareholder risk, 2) Provide demand price signals in PG&E/SCE service 
territories ASAP but no later than 10/1/2001 and 3) eliminate incentive for 
large SCs to under schedule in ISO real time market (adopt ISO proposals for 
imbalances in excess of 250 MW per hour).

lines to gathering lines.  As part of that Docket, several transmission lines 
were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to 
further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.   
On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting 
reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines.  
The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, 
H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, 
CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective 
April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff 
sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff 
sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel 
retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have 
questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at 
(304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.

Dear Pool Operator:

 CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings 
Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance 
starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires 
that the ""wet gas"" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.  
The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no 
unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations 
are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions 
concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed 
to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.

 Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets 
other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. 
on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations 
to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight 
and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per 
CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT 
considering 
the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your 
pool.

 As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult 
to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your 
pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's 
local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators 
notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify 
producers individually.

 We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted 
to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us 
to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled 
shut       down will not be until 2002.

 If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to 
contact me at (304) 623-8698. 

      Sincerely,



      Nancy M. Aucremanne
      Manager, Producer Services
      And Business Agreements

   CORNEY & BARROW, the mainly City wine bar chain, is going into the
derivatives market. The chain is thought to be the first in the
hospitality industry to take a position against our atrocious
weather.

   Sarah Heward, the managing director, got the idea after meeting a
bunch of customers who had just left Garban to set up their own
business, Speedwell Weather Derivatives. About half her wine bars
have outside terraces which have understandably not proven too
popular of late.
   ""They set me up with a hedge - my counterparty is Enron US,"" says
Heward. This safeguards a modest Pounds 15,000 of turnover.

SoCal Edison unsure banks will extend deadline

NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Embattled California utility Southern California 
Edison said on Tuesday it didn't know whether its bank lenders will extend 
their Tuesday deadline for the utility to clear up its credit line defaults.

``We don't have any indication'' the banks will extend their ``forbearance,'' 
said Ted Craver, chief financial officer of SoCal Edison parent Edison 
International (NYSE:EIX - news) in an investor conference call Tuesday 
afternoon.

Craver said the utility formally asked for an extension in a Tuesday morning 
conference call. Failure to get one could tip the utility much closer to 
bankruptcy, though Craver said the banks aren't looking to worsen the power 
crisis.

``My view of the relationship with the banks is that it's strong, and that 
they are, generally speaking, looking for ways to be cooperative and 
constructive in this process,'' he said.

SoCal Edison, California's No. 2 utility, and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the 
No. 1 utility and unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG - news), 
are trying to avoid bankruptcy.

They have been unable to recover about $12 billion because of a rate freeze 
imposed under California's 1996 utility deregulation law, which has left them 
unable to pass on their soaring wholesale power costs to consumers.

SoCal Edison has about $800 million of debts due this week. On Thursday a 
grace period to pay about $206 million of principal and interest on a 
five-year note issue expires.

Pacific G&E and its parent are also in default of various credit lines.

Creditors including independent power suppliers Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN - 
news), Mirant Corp. (NYSE:MIR - news) and Reliant Energy Inc. (NYSE:REI - 
news), meanwhile, are threatening to send both utilities into bankruptcy if 
they don't pay their debts.

Gov. Gray Davis and the state legislature are expected soon to create a plan 
that could allow the utilities to pay down some of their debt. Craver said 
``we're not betting the farm on getting a proposal'' by Friday.

Shares of Edison International, which is based in Rosemead, Calif., closed 
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $12.10, down 43 cents. PG&E shares 
closed on the Big Board at $12.30, down 25 cents.

Several bank lenders declined on Tuesday to discuss how they plan to address 
the utilities' defaults.

Bank One Corp. (NYSE:ONE - news), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C - news) and J.P. 
Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM - news) are among PG&E's lenders, while Bank of 
America Corp. (NYSE:BAC - news), Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase are among 
the lenders to SoCal Edison and its parent.

``We do not comment on customer relations,'' said Bank One spokesman Tom 
Kelly. J.P. Morgan Chase declined to discuss the matter. Bank of America and 
Citigroup did not return phone calls.

Sally,

Per Catherine at Travel Agency in the Park, bulkhead seats were all that were 
available when she booked flight 3 or 4 weeks ago.  Says those particular 
flights have gotten quite popular lately.  Only other option for return:

Same isle (E)
 - Row 8 (also bulkhead, but maybe not as noisy)
 - Last row window seat (doesn't recline as much as other seats)

If you like either of these better that existing seat, let me know & I change 
it.

I agree that we need to get together.  I am going to grind out a spreadsheet

night.  I know Ted is going to be gone for the weekend.

Can we get together tomorrow or over the weekend without Ted?  Ted is going
to do some research on the discount rate, which can be dropped in to any
analysis that we come up with.

What do you think?

Hey, I know it's a pain, but I think there would be value in getting
together (if folks are available) on Thursday evening from 7-10 with (lots

apartment, or anywhere else you folks would like to do it.  Thoughts?

"Peter,

Mark took a look at your termination and he thought it looked fine.  
Actually, he liked your termination and release better than the language we 
have in our form, so we're changing our form.  You are the man!

I checked the New York law when I drafted the termination so you're ok 
there.  

I'll be out all next week, my Mom's coming into town for the Thanksgiving 
holidays.  If you need to get hold of me my assistant will have my cell phone 
number (since it's NYMEX bid week and both Mark and I will be out, I have to 
be reachable.  Mark will have an international cell phone with him, he's 
sailing in the Caribbean, so if you need to get hold of him for any reason, 
Taffy will have the number).

Let me know if I can be of further help today!"

"Whew!! Your schedule makes me tired!  I am sure that Brigeda is happy that 
you are involved in so many activities with her school - and then on the 
other hand, sometimes you wonder if they notice!  Work sounds crazy for you, 
but how nice that you will be off from December 21 until the 2nd.  

I hope that make it over the week before Christmas.  The week is kind of 
crazy for us, so I am trying to find a time that will work.  Sunday the 17th 
we are having a dessert party at our house, inviting neighbors, old Huntwick 
friends, etc.  It is for families, and Meagan and Amanda each included 4 of 
their friends in the invitiation list, along with their familities.  It will 
be multi-generational - I hope fun, as it would be a nice tradition to 
continue.  On Monday, I think that David plans to take Tyler and Amanda to 
Longview for a visit.  A commitment that Meagan and I have to sort toys at 
Northwest Assistance Ministries from 12:30 to 4:00 that day has excused us 
from the trip.  So it may be best for Meagan and me to drive over to Austin 
after 4:00 on Monday.  We could be back by the time David and company return 
to Houston on Tuesday afternoon.  Wednesday we have matinee tickets to see A 
Christmas Carol at the Alley  Theater, sans Tyler.  Thursday I am having all 
of my girls in NCL over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for 
Christmas and then we will deliver the presents.  And Friday is Tyler's 
birthday, with a 102 Dalmation theme planned (cake ordered from RJ Goodies, 
but nothing else done yet!).  So I really think that our only shot to make it 
to Austin is for Monday night, which would mean only Meagan and me.  

I talked with Mom last night and invited Dad and her to Houston for 
Christmas.  I don't really think that they will come, but if they do, I hope 
that doesn't mess up your Christmas.  They have only been here for one or two 
Christmases with us since we have had kids.  I think that Tyler at 3 this 
year will be particularly enthralled.  And next year they will have 2 
grandchildren in Austin, so it just seemed that this could be a good year for 
them to come.  She said she would think about it, and I told her that I 
wanted her to know that we would love to have them, but that it was perfectly 
okay if they decided that they did not want to come.  

How about Dad playing golf this week?  What a difference!! I am so glad that 
he is doing better.  

I hear you about Mom.  I think that a blow-up or some drama is highly 
predictable, unfortunately.  She seems to do that a lot at special occassions 
for Cara, doesn't she?  I will certainly help in any way I can.  And I will 
be very interested in the gosipy details.  

Happy baking!    I do have to make 5 batches of fudge tonight and tomorrow 
night so that I can attend a cookie exchange luncheon on Saturday armed with 
27 packages of fudge.

thing, since I have volunteered to be Martha Stewart at many school events
this week and next.  LAst night was ""lessons and carols"" by the school
choir--with me decorating, baking, and coordinating.  Today I go to school
to make Christmas stockings with the kids--Sunday is the school Christmas
Bazaar at the Four Seasons--need to bring an item for the bake sale.  Also
need to start baking 12 gingerbread houses for Brigeda's class.    Did find
a matching mold to the smaller one we have so I can at least bake two at
once--twelve bakes is MUCH better than 24!  And then there is that dollhouse
that needs my attention by the 25!

I am totally ok with us not doing the shower.  We get credit for offering
but don't have to do anything.  Both money and time are in such short supply
for me that it works out for the best.  At work we start on a contract for
Dell in January.  The company is also going to pay for Java programming
classes for some of us (if I can nail this down then I can jump up to a
programmer level on that pay scale).  I also have a private contract job
with a needlepoint store in Memphis to setup their website.

Am somewhat concerned that Mother will have one of her dramas when Cara's
baby comes...you know she will get her feelings hurt somehow.  Not to
mention the fact that she will be sharing the grandchild with ""the most
selfish woman on earth.""  Richard and Brigeda went out to the Lowrimore farm
(they sold it and offered us all of the firewood).  Jane couldn't have been
sweeter to Brigeda--spent a lot of time with her.  Can just imagine that
""pained"" look in Mother's face at the hospital.  If you are not here may
need you to carry your cell phone so I can call for moral support--or at
least give you gossipy updates on the drama....

Are you planning to come later this month when you are off?  I'm taking off
the 21st and 22nd--they have given all of the technical production staff the
days between Christmas and New Years as comp time so I will be off until the
2nd...

Well, she declined our kind offer, didn't she?  As busy as life is between
work and home for me right now, I can't say that it will bother me too much
to attend a shower where someone else makes the finger sandwiched and
punch!  Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.  I
noticed some at a rack at Randall's the other day... (Just kidding!)

Hope you all are doing fine.  I was on jury duty three days last week -
really interesting, but totally screwed up my schedule at work.  I have
been doing double-time to try to catch up, especially since I plan to be
off the week of December 18th.

Thank you for the update.

Is not having the CPCN an absolute bar to beginning construction?  What are 
the risks?

Subject: CPCN Update

Sami Salib of the Public Staff is drafting the agenda item that will go on
the Commission's Open Agenda Conference for approval to establish the
procedural schedule for the CPCN application (intervention dates, intervenor
testimony, rebuttal testimony, etc).  Although he wanted to schedule the
evidentiary hearing for the last week in September, the Commisssion's
calendar is currently full.  So he has tentatively scheduled it for Monday,
October 2.  The problem with that is that it makes it virtually impossible
to meet the November 1 construction date if the Commission allows the
customary 30 days after the hearing in which to file briefs and proposed
orders.  I urged Sami to please see if he could calendar the hearing for the
third week in September.  

One of the things that ENA will have to do is to have notice published in
newspapers in the Rocky Mount area for several consecutive weeks prior to
the hearing so that affected persons will have an opportunity to comment.  I
am trying to get Sami to place the draft agenda item and procedural schedule
on the Commission's July 31 Open Agenda Conference so that the notices can
start to run August 7.  That action, along with scheduling the hearing for
the third week in September, will make it far more likely than not that the
CPCN will issue before November 1.  

Failing that, we can work with the Public Staff to shorten the period within
which to file briefs and proposed orders after the hearing to three or
preferably two weeks.  It will not be difficult to do that if there are no
intervenors, or if the intervenors do not object.

Sami has promised to let me know by tomorrow when the agenda item will go
before the Commission, and the dates in the procedural schedule.  Please
call me if you have questions.  Thanks.

"Susan Bailey, the paralegal working on this master, spoke to the Company 
after receiving these emails.  They faxed to her a copy of the assumed  name 
certificate wherein Northern Illinois Gas Company transacts business under 
the name Nicor Gas Company.  Per her conversations they have not changed 
their name, they are only operating under the assumed name Nicor Gas 
Company.  Being so, the online account would have to be renamed as Northern 
Illinois Gas company dba Nicor Gas Company.  Per my conversation with Stacy 
Dickson, a physical gas lawyer, they still transact physical gas under their 
master with Northern Illinois Gas Company.  I will have a copy of the assumed 
name certificate walked down to Adnan.  If we are all in agreement after 
this, it seems like we need two counterparty names ""Northern Illinois Gas 
Company"" and ""Northern Illinois Gas Company dba Nicor Gas Company"".  Upon 
receipt of the assumed name certificate, please confirm your agreement and I 
will contact Credit and the Online team.

OK, guys, based on Adnan's information from the counterparty, all contracts 
under Northern Illinois Gas Company will be changed (via name overlay) to 
Nicor Gas Company once Adnan has received the proper name change 
documentation.   Since no changes have been made in GCP to correct the HQ 
company and trade name relationships, the recent ISDA contract was set up 
under Nicor Gas Company.  Once these changes are made in GCP, the contract 
can be changed to the trade name if still needed at that time.

I apologize for all the confusion and hope this helps all parties concerned.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company  

Per my conversation with Nicor Gas Company's attorney, Northern Illinois Gas 
Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company. Therefore, Nicor Gas Company 
is the only entity that all the deals needs to be booked under. However, the 
attorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name ""Northern Illinois 
Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company"" eversince the name change happened. He 
said they had been using both names ""contractually"" and interchangeably even 
though it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.

I'm currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks 
like thats going to happen:
The main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the 
trades/contracts/deals being merged into one record. However, if need be we 
could have a Tradename set up as ""Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor 
Gas Company"" since this is how the company does business as, in some cases.

Nicor's legal Dept could be reached at (630) 983-8676 for any further 
clarifications in this matter.

Subject: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company

There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading 
with these entities.

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only 
trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.

The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under 
both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will 
resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical 
gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.

When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we 
want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the 
correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.

Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too.

State's Electric Bill Gets Lighter


Energy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO
Times Staff Writer

October 20 2001

SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday. 

Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. 

The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won't see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. 

Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state's power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. 

Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts. 

California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state's large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state's economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. 

In August, state officials estimated the department's power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. 

But in what consumer groups angrily called a ""jailbreak,"" Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state's power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state's power costs. 

Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to Consumers

The PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. 

However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration's latest numbers. 

""Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers,"" said Pete Garris, who oversees the department's power-buying division. ""Put simply, the PUC's delay in suspending direct access means [the state's] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers."" 

State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the ""stampede"" of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. 

""What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that's happened to consumers in this energy crisis,"" Angelides said. 

And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. 

""The PUC first gave Edison their bailout,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. ""Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place."" 

But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission's figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. 

Lynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration's request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. 

The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. 

""If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve,"" Lynch said. ""The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts."" 

Also adding to the state's financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan's interest rates. 

The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state's planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. 

Davis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on Strategy

In a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. 

If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. 

In another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. 

But Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. 

""I don't think it's real smart to tell you that,"" said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary."

Hi.

How's it going?

Any more thoughts on tomorrow night?  We could ask your mother to sit for a

The head of the power trading legal group stopped by and said to let her
know if I ever want to change groups.  I thought that was nice.

I'm contemplating doing something special with Michael over spring break.
I figure you guys have lots of ""guy only"" stuff coming up, but there aren't

Dear Dr. Kaminski

My name is Jaesoo Lew and I am referred by Dr. Wayne Lee.

Currently I've been working at Aquila Energy in Kansas City as an pricing
analyst since July 2000.  Since then, I have developed a natural gas storage
valuation model applying the swing options (forest method) pricing approach.
The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation
since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c++
programming using Excel DLL has been developed, too.

I attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking
forward to talking about an opportunity at Enron.

My home phone number is 913-649-0578, Dr. Kaminski, I will wait your call in
this week as Dr. Lee informed me.  If possible, please let me know your
expected calling day through the mail.  I appreciate your consideration.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew

P.S.  Nice use of ""birthday"" as the segue to the deal.

Speaking of birthdays, Prentice has informed me that, despite my
protestations (being a very low-key sort of guy), there ""must"" be some
party for my birthday this year (which I'm still opposed to--and I may be
in Houston that MONTH anyway).

I was thinking (cuz I hate spotlights), that it might be fun and
interesting, since your Dad and I are both hitting interesting birthdays
this year, if we had a joint party---double the people, double the fun.  (I
don't know if he'd rather have a solo party for his, though.)  And since my
dad's met your dad, but our mom's ain't been in the mix,  I though it might
be a good (and hopefully safe) atmosphere to get them together in.

Am I smoking crack on the whole idea?

"Enron to cut one-fifth of jobs at broadband unit.

04/06/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

HOUSTON, April 6 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Friday 
it will eliminate some 250, or roughly 20 percent, of the jobs at its 
broadband telecommunications unit, detailing a move which it has previously 
described as an internal redeployment of staff. 
Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said the company is 
cutting jobs at the unit, which now employs 1,150 people, because it has 
completed the build-out of its 18,000-mile (29,000 km) fiber-optic network 
and because of slow demand for streaming media products delivered to personal 
computers.
""The network is substantially complete now, so that means fewer people are 
required for technical positions,"" she said. 
The job cuts also reflect Enron Broadband's decision to play a less active 
role in the market for streaming media services, such as video of corporate 
events delivered to personal computers, where demand had been slower than 
expected, she said. 
However, Kimberly said Enron Broadband will continue to pursue 
entertainment-on-demand services actively. 
Kimberly said employees whose jobs are being eliminated will be eligible for 
redeployment to other positions at Enron Broadband Services or other Enron 
units, although there could be some involuntary terminations. 
Previously Enron officials had dismissed rumors about job cuts at Enron 
Broadband Services and had spoken instead of an internal redeployment of 
staff within the unit without detailing its impact on overall employment 
there. 
The company's stock, which peaked at just above $90 last year and was trading 
in the $80s as recently as mid-February, has recently fallen into the $50s in 
line with broader weakness in the stock market and among technology and 
telecommunications stocks in particular. On Friday it was up 95 cents at 
$56.65. 
Since early last year Enron has been building a high-speed broadband 
communications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth 
marketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and 
electricity trading operation. 
Excitement among investors about the broadband business and about Enron's 
success in developing a strong Internet-based trading platform for energy and 
other commodities drove an 87 percent rise in the company's share price last 
year, outpacing a gain of 54 percent for the S&P utilities index. 
Kimberly said Enron's bandwidth trading operation is continuing to perform 
strongly, with more than 500 trades carried out in the first quarter, 
exceeding the total for all of 2000. 
Despite the jobs cuts at Enron Broadband, she said, the unit is recruiting to 
fill some other positions.

I share your pain about increased deal flow.  Have you spoken with Lavo about 
getting additional resources or is there a way to better allocate resources?  
Is the Entelligence database used by anybody?  Should we not focus those 
resources on GCP?

I am getting hammered on the exposure questions.

Subject: Re: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty  

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

Taking a look at BPA from the 3/8/01 list, I noticed that we've got them 
opened up for west coast power only on the offer and not the bid.  I have no 
notes that they are restricted in that manner.  What's the scoop?  Marcus, do 
you see any reason they should be restricted to the offer side?"

Dan:

Will Enovate cause us to become ""undone"" or what?  Today, one of our
Accountants asked me to change the address for Enovate to the Enron,
Houston address.  Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gas
management system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section from
the Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feed
the Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being the
Chicago, Illinois information.  So, I politely told the Accountant that the
info in the gas management system was correct as entered.  He (the
Accountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at
713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go to
Enovate c/o Enron at 1400 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 77002.  Do you
have any objection to changing this in the contract?  Please advise, we'd
like to do what would best streamline this process.

Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everything
will run smoothly.  Thanks again for your help.

Regards,
Ellen

Subject:  Enovate, L.L.C. Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we ""need"" ""financially firm"" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that ""financially firm"" ""needed"" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
""financially firm"" out and ""firm"" substituted.

The definition for ""firm"" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for ""firm"" that is in the GISB as follows:

""Firm"" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that ""Financially Firm""
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of ""Financially Firm"" to just
""firm""?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through ""Financially"" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX ""1"" would have to be
redone to replace ""Financially Firm"" with just ""Firm"".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

Ellen Dailey

Daren,

As you know, we have experienced some fluctuations at the Berryman well for 
OCT, which in turn affects our volumes at the Gulf Plains Plant.  From a 
physical standpoint, I think that we are fairly well balanced.  My concern is 
that we are ""overproduced"" on paper by 76,162 Dth/Mo.   I think that we need 
to bring the nominations up to balance in Sitara at the Berryman well and, a 
corresponding volume at Meters 708 and 6363, with an offset on Strangers to 
keep the physical side in line.  If my understanding is correct (and if not, 
please correct me) this should have a positive impact on our current month 
UA4.

Thank you,

Mary

to absorb the shortfall between the price cap and DWR's cost of power.  
Instead, she said that DWR will be responsible for those costs.  (That ought 
to make DWR an even less creditworthy entity.)  I'll check in with Mike Day's 
folks to make sure that I heard correctly and get more details.  Will report 
back just as soon as we get more information.

This is not good.  It seems as if Rozja (Peace's right hand man) or the CPUC 
handed Hoecker the questions and he said:  ""Oh, I'll take care of getting the 
answers to these for you!""  Ron Carroll at Bracewell said he would work with 
the CPUC subpoena group in addressing these.

Subject: VaR numbers for the 26th

Hi Andreas,

I have run the VaR model for the 26th July and have attached a zip file of 
the results:

The total VaR is $4,170,653 and the Cu position is $1,852,876.


I have had trouble getting hold of you so I thought I would summarised what I 
wanted to talk about (also I thought 
I would give your ears a rest!)
Basically it is wrt the second point in your mail yesterday (we briefly 
discussed it earlier). 
The fax you sent me to explain the risk calculation suggested that you use a 
5 day period of adjustment to calculate 
the risk (in this case it is called Capital at Risk). The VaR calculation for 
our model is for a one day holding period which means that your risk factor
will be reduced by a factor equal the sqrt(5) or 2.24. 
Since :

Old risk factor (%) =  1.65*(std of the price movement) = 3.99%
 
New daily risk factor = 3.99/2.24  = 1.78%    which actually equates to std 
of approx 1.1% a day.
I am happy with this as a estimate of the vol as the annualized spot vol we 
are showing for Cu is approx 19% which equates to approx 1.2% daily.

Using this new risk factor for the daily VaR the Cu positions would give a 
VaR (for the 19th) of approx $2m which is less that the 
figure we estimated ($3,100,568).
The other thing is that by taking net numbers we are disregarding the term 
structure of the price curve/vol curve and position 
curve and are hence collapsing everything into a one factor model which means 
that it is difficult to compare the numbers.
I hope that this helps to explain our number.

Hopefully we can talk tomorrow,
Cheers
Kirstee

Subject: Enron Industrial Markets - Super Saturday Recruiting

I need your help!  On Saturday, 01/20/01, EIM is having a Super Saturday to 
recruit experienced Commercial Support personnel to fill many of our 
vacancies.  Unfortunately, we don't have enough personnel to do the 
interviewing.  To round out the Logistics team, I am looking for one more 
interviewer.  The current team is Roy Lipsett, Dan Hamilton and Del Davis.  
Both Dan and Del are new to Enron (Del started 1/8 and Dan is still 
transitioning his prior job and moving to Houston), but bring a wealth of 
Logistics experience for our industries.  I would love to have one additional 
team member to provide input from the Enron perspective.  Will this candidate 
fit into the expectations of Enron?  Will the candidate compete when compared 
to their peers.  Unfortunately, Logistics candidates below Manager have been 
difficult to find from the industry.  There seems to be a tendancy towards 
clerical skill sets but compensation at a Specialist level.  Consequently, I 
have been cautious around these candidates as I would not want to set them up 
to fail.

I know the sacrifice of a Saturday, but I would value the input that any one 
of you might offer.  We do expect it to be a full day commitment as we have 
several candidates, and we will have a follow-up evaluation session.  I know 
I can't adequately compensate you for your day, but I would be happy to buy 
you a dinner for two.  Please let me know ASAP.  Assuming worst case that noe 
of you are available, I would welcome other suggestions.

In advance, I appreciate your help.

I received a call from Carr Futures this morning.  Their parent, Cr?dit Agricole Indosuez, is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with Enron North America Corp. and Enron Capital and Trade Resources International.

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

How do you want to proceed?

Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  Cove Point LNG is a peaking facility.  There are three 10-day peaking
contracts for 50,000 Dthd each or a total of 150,000 Dthd of peaking 
capability
by delivery from the Cove Point pipeline into the east side of TCO's system.
The gas can also go directly into Washington Gas Light or into PEPCO's Chalk
Point electric generation facility.  The variable transport cost on Cove Point
LNG is less than $0.005/Dth.  This gas was hedged by CES as baseload 
withdrawal
during the January 1999, but can be withdrawn any time before the end of the
contracts which is 2/29/2000.

2.  The TCO storage is the CES retail storage.  Enron's contract with CES
retail contains the withdrawal schedule for this storage.  I would work with 
Ed
McMichael's group who should be getting this schedule from CES Retail.

I have 2 storage questions for now.

1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking 
facility.
The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or
were you going to use this as peaking gas?


2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current 
storage
balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??

Subject: Spreadsheet database for purchase

Hi Mark, as per our discussion earlier today, here is the contract that KMI 
wants us to sign.  Please review as soon as you can.  As I mentioned in our 
discussion, I am heading up the EBS research group reporting to Vince 
Kaminski and Stinson Gibner (MDand VP of Enron Global Research, 
respectively).  Vince has asked me to talk you directly on matter such as 
this rather than using EBS service since we will be performing much of the 
work stationed out of Enron Corp and the database itself and any resulting 
analysis will reside in Research.

I took a quick look at the contract and already found some things that seems 
too restrictive.  For example, the following clause may need to be removed 
unless you think it would not affect us:

Fourth paragraph:  "" (ii) that you are in a business that does not include 
the operating of an online exchange or auction for bandwidth""  

Strictly speaking, we are NOT in the business of online exchange or auction 
for bandwidth (since that is how we differentiate our market-making activity 
from other online exchange players such as Band-x and Rate exchange), our 
trading activity can be loosely defined as such in an very immature trading 
market such as the current status of telecom market.  What do you think?  I 
would like to set up a meeting with you to discuss EBS and our role and how 
this database will be used, etc... Please have your assistant call Kristy 
Carnes to set up this meeting this week.

I thank you very much for offering to take a look at this at such a short 
notice.



Regards,

Ravi.

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and 
Alexander has asked for you to talk to Bears directly.

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

Subject:	Thoughts on PX Credit Claim with Edison

Chris:
A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday):
A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.
After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) 
We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.  
In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution.
We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.)
For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs.
We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC. 

With respect to what else we could offer them:
From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge.
One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.  Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.)
Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective.
One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.  
This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.
The ""note"" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Jeff

is any opportunity for me to work at Enron during this summer for free. I am
confident that my sincere interest in derivatives will allow me to greatly
contribute to Enron during this summer. I am particularly interested in

31st, and I sent him email yesterday asking for the opportunity to work for

I am looking forward to hearing from you. If I can provide more information
or answer additional questions, please feel free to contact me either by
telephone (615-496-1132) or via e-mail

Thanks for the message.  I don't think there is any way that we will get 100% 
pay on all 8 weeks so let's just go with the 100/90 split.  you may want to 
ask michelle how best to code it with my vacation time so that they get it 
right the first time.    as for charles, he is doing great.  i'm typing all 
small letters now because he is insisting on me holding him, but i'm learning 
how to do more than 1 thing at a time.  he is a night owl so i try to sleep 
some in the afternoon and so far so good.  i'm learning how to exist on 
little sleep.  it is a big help to have bill at home and while charles 
sleeps, we get alot done as there are still some house things that we need to 
finish.

tell dan happy birthday and as for yours, i'll catch up as soon as i become 
more portable which should be soon.  as for flower pick-up, feel free to stop 
by after work whenever.  just call and let me know.  i've got 2 baskets that 
will probably only survive here another day or so so you are welcome to them 
and you can sneak a peek at charles at the same time.  

well i've got to go.  i'll talk/see you soon.

Well, I survived the dentist (7 hours in the chair),  Of course I started my 
period too, so I had cramps a backache and headache and my mouth open all 
going on at the same time.  It was NOT fun at all, but I made it through. 
It's nice to know the worst is over.  My temporaries look pretty good too.  I 
still have to go by the lab and do a couple of other things, but my permanent 
teeth should be put in on August 18th.  I'm just going to take the day too 
because lord only knows how long it'll take!  Then I'm finished until next 
year!  Whew!

I'll figure up 4 weeks of sick time and then I'll do your vacation and then 
do 4 more weeks of sick time.  I emailed Michelle Word from your email if the 
8 weeks were all 100% paid, so if you get that email, be sure and let me know 
what she says.  I'm trying to get you 8 weeks at 100% pay.  

It's pretty quiet around here so far today.  Dan's birthday is next Monday 
and we are going to take him to lunch and I'm getting him cigars (of 
course).  Mine is also coming up so Ric is going to take me to Pappas 
Steakhouse.  I've never been there and have been wanting to go.  He's already 
made the reservations and everything.  I can't believe I'm going to be 
45!!!!!!!  My body feels every year though!

How are you adjusting?  Charles sleeping any longer?  Keep in touch.  Oh, I 
received the thank you cards and will distribute them.  Thank you for the 
nice one to me.

"1. 468359 is Mike Swerzbin's deal. He entered it incorrectly in his log. It's 
changed now.

2. 468404 and 468405 - Bob Badeer was given the wrong numbers by Amerex. He's 
changed the deals to reflect Amerex numbers.

3. 468302 is Donald Robinson's deal. I'm tracking him down right now to check 
on the term.

4. 468427 is $177, not $197. Jeff has really bad handwriting. I'll change 
this as soon as the calc is done (about 30 min.).

5. I've left Jeff a message - he's at an off-site meeting today and is

To: Edmund Cooper/LON/ECT@ECT
cc: gilbergd@sullcrom.com 
Subject: Re: EnronOnline - Credit Product Documentation  

Edmund:

Thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay, just a couple of 
questions and minor points ont eh GTC - 

In paragraph 1, the usual practice in North America would be for the executed 
confirmation to control over other evidence.

Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master 
agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions 
should not be included when they determine their rights to call for 
collateral under the masters.

I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.  Is 
this particular to credit derivatives?

With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that 
these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by 
the Mater User.  It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the 
authority to amend the ETA.  Is the purpose of the second sentence to 
""deactivate"" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction?  
If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a 
master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected 
counterparties.  (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty 
execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC 
would acknowledge that the master did not control.)

I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy 
Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is 
impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.  If we 
actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have 
the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods 
for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to 
more than 60 days).

I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term ""Month.""  What would the Effective 
Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?  You could argue that 
it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March.  
The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day 
convention.

This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives  -  should we apply a 
different interest rate to non-US$ payments?

It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives 
trading agreements be subject to arbitration.  We rarely submit to the 
jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the 
US.  Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some 
straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.

Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we 
decided not to include one here for a particular reason?

Again. sorry for the delay.  I will be here all week and happy to discuss any 
of these points.

Mark

Dear Gavin,

Thanks for the latest drafts of the GTCs. 

I have spoken with Paul about the comments on the GTCs from Tax in Houston, 
and I have also spoken with Tax in London, and there are a few small changes 
to the tax provisions of the GTC which London Tax feel appropriate.  I have 
marked-up the proposed amendments and have also made a few other small 
tidy-up changes as well.

I have made the changes to the US GTC (with collateral) and these changes 
should be reflected in all the other GTCs EXCEPT that the amended references 
to ""the United States"" in Section 11(B) should remain as references to ""the 
United Kingdom"" in the non-US and non-Canadian GTCs.  Please let me know if 
this is unclear.

Unless you have any comments on these revisions, please could you prepare 
amended versions of the GTCs in anticipation of any final changes from local 
counsel.

Many thanks,

Edmund.

"Michael Tribolet:

In response to your question, yes, Edison did file in federal district court 
in L.A.  The filing asks the judge to force the CPUC to 1) declare that the 
rate free is over and 2) raise rates to compensate Edison for its 
undercollections.  (Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court 
agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass 
through the power purchase costs to customers.)

The filing is apparently very large.  The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but 
said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to 
us to make a copy for ourselves.

Question to the lawyers:  Do we have contacts in L.A. that can go to the 
courthouse and get a copy of the filing for us?  Probably a good idea to have 
that filing passed around to this distribution list.

Jeff"

Subject: Notes from Wednesday (9/13/00) Development Meeting



CPCN
Allyson filed the ammended application 9/13/00.
Intervener and staff testimony is due 9/15/00.  This changed to 9/22 based on 
Allyson's email.
Enron rebuttal testimony is due 9/22/00.  This will be moved back as well.
Commission hearing is on 10/2/00.  This should stay firm based on Allyson's 
email.

Note:  If the AG's office and NCNG, the intervenersm, elect not to file 
testimony on 9/15/00, they can still come to the hearing and cross-examine.

Commission may issue CPCN conditional upon execution of the PPA; however, 
this is not certain.
Staff is worried about Merchant Plants--the VEPCO PPA has the shortest time 
period they have seen.
Allyson will call the AG's office 9/14/00 to discuss the AG's intervention.
The Commission's hearing will be October 2, 2000.
We will ask for an expedited briefing schedule (i.e. 2 weeks)
Optimistically, CPCN may be issued by the end of October.
We can only do site preparation work without the CPCN.  NO CONSTRUCTION.

Action Items:
Get a copy of the AG's intervention papers.
What is the status of NCNG's intervention?
Get Allyson to define the schedule going forward including potential hurdles.


Electrical Interconnect

Reagan and Terri spoke with Tim Talmadge (VEPCO) 9/13/00.  It appears that 
VEPCO is not far along in the study process.  We will follow-up with Wayne 
Duman of VEPCO and set a meeting as necessary.  Before we talk with VEPCO 
again, however, we need to understand the interconnect process with respect 
to the Edgecombe project.  Are we subject to the VEPCO tariff interconnect 
procedures, does PPA specify, or is this VEPCO's problem not ours? 

Action items:
Meet with Heather to discuss interconnect as it stands to date (i.e. with 
respect to VEPCO RFP and PPA negotiations).
Review VEPCO tariff.
Review PPA for reference.
Review draft interconnect agreement and submit/negotiate with VEPCO.
Followup with Wayne Duman to further discuss VEPCO interconnect issues and 
set meeting, as necessary.
We need to find out who VEPCO's attorney is who is working on the 
Interconnect and Operating Agreement.


Gas

The gas deal is a function of annexation of the property by Rocky Mount 
insofar as Rocky Mount will be the gas supplier.

Action Items:
Where does Rocky Mount (LDC) stand with repsect to getting their allocations 
from NCNG increased?
Is our site behind the Rocky Mount gate?
Do we need to work on an interconnect agreement with NCNG concurrently (as an 
insurance policy)?
Develop a construction schedule.
Check with Bill Sherk to see what his progress has been regarding NCNG 
negotiations.
Meet with Heathe and Ozzie to discuss/strategize.

Annexation/Zoning/Conditional Use Permit

Bill Sherk referred us to Bill Hoyle, attorney for the city's planning 
commission.  Hoyle referred us to Deck McCain, senior planner for the city.  
Discussions with McCain (9/13/00) reveal some timing issues with respect to 
annexation.  If we begin construction prior to annexation, we must go through 
the county's process--Stuart Bass is the county planning director.  Once 
annexation happens, we go through the city's process.  

The city process would include re-zoning as I2CU (CU = conditional use).  
This would take care of zoning and the conditional use permit at the same 
time.  This does involve filing notice AND holding a public meeting AND is 
expected to take approximately 60 days.  McCain was to prepare a package of 
information including the annexation petition, general statutes, and a letter 
describing the city's process and Enron deliverables.

In a follow-up conversation with McCain (9/14/00), he indicated that the 
city's expectation is that Enron would begin construction before annexation.  
We would, therefore, be subject to the county's zoning and conditional use 
permit processes.  He put his submittal preparation on hold as a result.

Action Items:
Talk with Kay Mann regarding expansion of Kilpatrick's scope to define these 
processes (zoning, annexation, and conditional use permitting) for us.
We need to build the ""road maps"" for annexation, zoning, and conditional use 
permitting processes.
Understand how zoning and conditional use permitting-- at the city and county 
levels--effect construction.
Begin Conditional Use Permitting process with county and city, concurrently.

Taxation

Rocky Mount made a verbal tax proposal totaling approximately $750,000 over 4 
years.  We have not evaluated or discussed with them further.  Financial 
model uses Enron tax assumptions.

Action Items:
Calculate present value of the Rocky Mount proposal.
Get with Kay Mann to see if Kilpatrick can get a copy of the deal Dynegy 
negotiated for their project.
What is the legal framework through which Rocky Mount has to offer such a tax 
deal?

like?
Determine what depreciation schedule the city will use.
Determine what we think the taxes ought to be and PV it as a point of 
comparison.


Land 

Mayor of Rocky Mount was contacted by Bill Sherk last week about getting the 
ball rolling on acquiring more land.  Bill Sherk is going to begin the 
discussions with Ms. Ryerson and wants to make sure how much additional land 
we are asking for.

Action Items:
Review site map with respect to additional land desires.
Followup with Bill Sherk.
Talk with Kay regarding option conveyance document and lease agreement.

Air

Air permit is in-house.  To finalize the permit, we need to get a letter from 
the city, the county or both.

Action Items:
Get Janet's signature on the permit application.
Get check cut for application fee.
Get necessary letter from City of Rocky Mount and/or Edgecombe County (ENSR 
is engaged on this).
Send it all in.

Regulatory

During thsi politically driven CPCN process and considering the critical 
juncture, we should enlist external support, as we can.

Sara

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and 
Alexander has asked for you to talk to Bears directly.

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

Thanks
Simon

Jeff,
Is it possible for TW to get a copy of the Edison filing at the CPUC?  While 
the article [shown below] doesn't provide any details, I suspect Edison's 
complaint echoes earlier allegations against El Paso regarding their sale of 
the 1.2 Bcf/d block of capacity to their affiliate.  I don't think 
Transwestern and/or Enron affiliate marketing companies are implicated in 
this deal at all.  

Can you confirm this is an ""El Paso only"" problem and not something Enron is 
being drawn into?  I really appreciate your help here.

Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation

Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California 
Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices 
on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that 
Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen 
by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the 
withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the 
supply basins and the California border. 

""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential 
has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, 
collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and 
merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint 
""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998."" 

Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of 
$4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, 
to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the 
month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September 
bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in 
Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to 
certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month 
prior, the company told the CPUC. ""No mechanism exists to recapture the 
increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in 
another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time.""

Having said that, I agree that the weather information is probably the least 
risky, but it might be helpful if you were to visit their sites and see if 
there is any comment about further use of the information posted there.  As 
for the others, a little additional information would be helpful.  For 
instance, I know we were in discussions with NGTL at one time and were 
unwilling to sign the letter they asked for.  Was there ever any follow-up 
with them on that?  Is there any correspondence at all (it doesn't have to 
look like an official contract).  Is the Telerate information also available 
from other sources?  Is it possible that Telerate gets it out really fast and 
that is their advantage but others are right behind with the same or very 
similar information?  Do we have an agreement of any kind with Telerate 
regarding the services they provide to us?

Thanks for your help and continuing attention to this - I agree we should be 
trying to do this the ""right"" way.

Mark

Subject: Legal Issues with EnronOnline Newsticker


	

Dear Mark (back from South America?)

I received this email from Donna Greif.  It explains the sources for her data 
which she puts on EnronOnline every day.  As best I know, Mark, we don't have 
any agreement with any of these people for content that we place online.

I'm not too concerned about the weather (it's from the Canadian and American 
governments) but I am concerned about the NGTL data and the data we get from 
Telerate.

We have a disclaimer Online for the NGTL data, saying that it's our 
reproduction and not a representation of what they have on their own site 
(their own site which can be accessed through a password only!), but I think 
this proves, rather than refutes, the fact that we're redistributing their 
data without a right to do so.  The same applies for Telerate--we don't even 
give them recognition--we just post their numbers on our site.

I know you're a busy man, and I'm sure you're dealing with things like 
lawsuits against Enron by South American governments, or something like that, 
but this issue should (a) be dropped, because you believe that it's really 
not that important or (b) resolved, becuase you think it is.

Please tell me how I can help, or if we should let this issue drop.  If I 
don't hear from you, I'll assume that you don't think it's an important issue.

Thanks

Jay

Subject: Re: EnronOnline Newsticker  

Jay,

In your original email (attached below), you requested my source of US Nat 
Gas Stats that are posted as a newsticker item on the website.   Please note, 
I would have been more than happy to provide you with source details on the 
Canadian Weather Forecasts and NGTL Pipeline Data if it was part of your 
original request.

US Natural Gas Statistics (Gas in Storage & Cumulative Heating Degree Days)
 * My source is the Producer Newsletter distributed by the Mid-Marketing 
Department (Ross Prevatt & Dan Diamond
    are both part of that team).  For your convenience, I've attached a copy 
for your records
 * The Producer Newsletter is distributed on a weekly basis (Monday nights or 
Tuesday morning)
     and is faxed.  
        - the Mid-Marketing Department gets those numbers from several 
different sources.
        - I called Ross again today to re-verify.  He confirmed the following 
for me:
  * Gas Storage data comes from a direct feed from Telerate.
  * Lucy Oritz passes on the cumulative heating degree days to Ross.
       > Her source is National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration
       > web address = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/grr/wfolocat.htm
     - Should you require any additional details and need to make contact 
with Ross again.....
       I did take the liberty of explaining who you are, the group you 
represent as well as
       why you were needing this information.  I am sure he will be fully 
receptive and understand
       the nature of your question should you need to contact him again.  

Canadian Weather Forecasts (4 day forecast for 5 cities)
NGTL Pipeline Data (Prior day deliveries, etc.)
 * Candace Spencer & Terri Brian in Enron Canada's office pull this 
information from two different sources.  
 * They pull this information together, and fax updates us each morning.
     - NGTL Pipeline Data is pulled from 
http://www.nrgexpressway.com/ngtl/index.htm
  * You must have a password to gain access to this information.
     - Canadian Weather Forecast data is pulled from 
http://weather.ec.gc.ca/alberta_e.shtml
  * Upon reaching the site, you would select the appropriate City.
  * Once in the city, scroll down to get the weather forecast data.

My apologies for any mis-communications on your original request.  Feel free 
to call me if you are in need of more 
details (x3-9517).

Thanks,

dg


P.S.  Currently, Noel Petterson is updating the website.  His back-up is Matt 
Motsinger.   In additions (just an FYI), this
will be my last week with the EnronOnline team.   Please forward any future 
requests to Frank Davis.

Subject: EnronOnline Newsticker

Following our exchange of emails two weeks ago, I spoke with Ross (whom you 
suggested), but he didn't know of you & didn't think that anything he 
produced was sent to you.  He suggested that I contact Dan Diamond, who wrote 
back saying that he didn't know anything either but that I should contact 
Rahil Jafry.  The only problem of course is that I work with Rahil, and I'm 
trying to find this information in response to a discussion that I had with 
him!

So, could you tell me exactly where you get your information from, for the 
following items:

Canadian Weather Forecasts (4 day forecast for 5 cities)
NGTL Pipeline Data (Prior day deliveries, etc.)
US Natural Gas Stastics (Gas in Storage & Cumulative Heating Degree Days)

Even if you don't know the specific source, if you could tell me how you get 
the information, then I'll try to follow it up.  So, for example, 'Each day 
at 6am I receive a fax from 713.853.2297 with a list of numbers.  I take 
these numbers and put them in the Canadian ...'

Sorry to keep bothering you, but this is a potentially serious issue for 
us--we need to know exactly where we're getting our content from, and no one 
seems to know!  So anything that you can do to help would be appreciated 
greatly.

Thanks in advance

Jay

The EnronOnline team gets those numbers from the weekly Newsletter 
distributed the ENA Commercial Team.   Ross Prevatt is the individual who
actually puts the information together.

In talking with Ross this morning, that information is taken from a Telerate 
feed  (the Telerate feeder gets the info from daily/weekly/monthly 
publications).  Ross did not give me the specific companies that publish the 
information.  Feel free to call Ross directly if you need additional 
information.

Thanks,

Dear Donna

(Following the voicemail that I left for you on Friday)  I was wondering if 
you could tell me whether or not the US Gas Storage data & the cumulative 
CDD/HDD data are taken from inside Enron only?  (I'm asking because Paul 
Goddard has encouraged me to update our letters of consent for content that 
we carry on the website.)

Many thanks,

Jay

I have been in contact with Ted Jacobs and have volunteered $1500 in 
scholarship funds to be awarded by Enron this spring.  By volunteering this 
money, we are now able to attend scholarship interviews on Tuesday, March 6 
on campus.  This will provide us with the opportunity to target candidates 
for next fall and lay the groundwork for a more competitive future.

After we have identified our scholarship recipients, we are invited to 
present our awards at the Scholarship Awards Banquet on Friday, April 20.  

Ted will (if he has not already) approach you, Mike, to see if you are 
interested in playing a role at this event.   If you are available to attend, 
please let me know.  I plan to have at least 2 Enron representatives at the

I just wanted to give each of you these details to keep you fully informed of

Both,

Thanks for your comments and comparisons, it is good to get context.

Based on your comments here would be my proposal

o63,500 basic salary - 
o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each 
anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 - 
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 
1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.  

Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so 
this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.  

Let me know your thoughts.

I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember

to Enron than Anjam.

Also, the term ""Relevant Price"" is used in the ""Negotiated Fallback""

Thanks for your comments.  A new draft should be out shortly that addresses
your comments.  Re the deleted language in 3.4, it is considered essential
that nothing can happen to terminate the Fixed Payment side of the Swap
since this could arguably taint the Floating Payment obligations.  The
investors are very sensative to this concern and I'm not sure we care.  Let
me know if you disagree.

Jeff:
Just a few comments:

1.   In the definition of termination Event, I think that the words ""due
to""
need to be put after the word ""means"" in the first line.

2.   In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae ""as it
relates to
the Assigned Interest"" has now been deleted.  Pursuant to my earlier
comment on
this, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Payment
piece of
this, we can never terminate the swap based on something that happens to
Pelican
.  Is that the way it is supposed to work?  If so, plaese explain why.

3.   With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of saying
in the
first sentence of such Section ""the amount determined..."" shouldn't it
say ""the
fair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under the
Transaction"".  Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to Disputed
Matters and
it is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default or
Termination
Event occurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events occur.
What
is the priocedure for coming up with this amount?  Does each party
calculate it
and then send it to the experts or do the experts just determine it?

"I have reviewed Tana's list of North American utilities and have the 
following comments:

(1)  I have tried to eliminate all governmentals and regulated entities.  
However, I suggest that we ask Kevin Leitao to take a quick review for 
obvious errors.  (However, I don't want Kevin to prepare unlimited research 
on our behalf.  I'll discuss with him).

(2)  I suggest that we ask Canadian counsel to review Canadian utilities on 
authority/regulatory issues.  In my experience, Canadian outside counsel was 
reluctant to even comment on utilities located in provinces other than 
outside counsel's domicile.

(3)  The online omnibus does not contain the ISDA Section 3(c) rep as to 
absence of litigation.  This rep drags in governmental bodies and all 
agencies (hence, a state PUC).  Thus, online parties will rep as to authority 
to transact each time they trade but we will not know about potential PUC 
issues.  (Under the ISDA, a party would have to notifiy us of a ""Regulatory 
Development"" and we may have an Event of Default for failure to notify; we 
may also have a Termination Event under our current format)."

Eric:

Am in the process of arranging your Shanghai leg of the journey. Will set up

a package that allows you to choose meals. I think you should have a little
guidance in your explorations of the Shanghai area. Shanghai is a friggin
mad-house (16 million people) and if you ain't got the language skills
they will bend you over a rickshaw and ride you like a poodle. So- let me
set up your hotel and sightseeing for you. You can break loose from the
""tour group"" vibe later in Qingdao. Keep in mind that you'll be in a
relatively small group (ie. it won't be a Greyhound bus packed full of
gawking blue-hairs). I'll send full Shanghai details when the biz is
finished later today...

In regards to the Beijing leg, we altered the itinerary to suit our needs.
We knocked out the bullshit and kept the bliss nuggets. You should have a
traditional Beijing roast duck dinner (it rocks!) and you should experience
Beijing Opera at least once in your life. We'll see the Beijing Opera in a
famous Beijing teahouse while sucking tea and brews and nibbling on pickled
chicken feet and other assorted delicacies. We knocked out the full two-hour

Beijing Opera performance that would have been later in the week. We'll be
staying in a Wangfujing hotel. Wangfujing is the trendy shopping street in
downtown Beijing; should make the wives happy. It'll be $70 USD/night.

Will send full Beijing details when we've finished the haggling and cheating

rituals that make life so wonderful in the middle kingdom.

Take care, guyeee.

Love,

Jon

December 26th, we will trading that day.  Lots of my logistics and risk guys 
will be in, so I will probably make an appearance that day.  I will be in for 
full days on the 27th -29th.  Very few commitments on the calendar for those 
days, so just let me know when you would like to get together.

Just wanted to confirm my availability   and maybe see if we should get

I think you said that you will be in London in early January - is that still

Also -- I am planning to be ready to start work with you on Jan 29th  
(hopefully I can get Lauren into her school the week before - so she can get 
used to it).   We are leaving London on the 20th (AA signs of on our year end 
earnings release on Friday the 19th)  and then I will have a week to sort 
things out at home before starting!



I am really looking forward to learning something new, and working with you.  
Thanks for the opportunity.



If we don't speak before the holidays, I hope your family has a wonderful 
Christmas.

"Clayton,

It translates into a credit risk for those on the other side of the hedge.
Many producers have a long history of poor timing of hedges.
I could give you quite a long list. They definitely need a bright
adviser who will tell them the price of gas two years from now.

Vince:

Here's an amazing factoid in today's paper related to the issue of how much 
money you can ""make"" (sic) by hedging:

...

Other companies analysts say are saddled with hedges include El Paso Energy 
Corp. and Coastal Corp., which are merging. 

A Coastal official declined to comment on the company's forward positions. 

Although El Paso is known for its pipeline business, it produces gas as 
result of its $6.2 billion acquisition last year of Sonat. ""More than 90 
percent"" of that gas is hedged through the rest of the year, said Bruce 
Connery, vice president of investor relations. The forward contracts are for 
$2.40, he said. 

Hedging in the current market plays to the company's primary aim of meeting 
investors' expectations, Connery said. 

""Our first goal is to deliver the earnings goal that we set out, and that 
dictates that we hedge out commodity volatility,"" he said. 


...

$2.40??? Are you kidding????

Clayton

"What's this - according to Navigator, we only have this contract for 1 day on 
Feb 23rd?  I just entered it in the ces retail sheet.  MDQ = 5000 and the 
rate is $.01?  Who did this deal?

The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley, NGPL, and Tenn-Egan.   The delivery 
point is Rayne.  It looks like we nominated gas on this contract.  I'm 
setting up this up in Sitara and on our 2000tran02.xls worksheet and I 
entered it in Sitara deal 223022.

Jesse, this will need to be scheduled in Unify."

"John and Molly:
I have reviewed the ISDA Master that we have with Range Resources and here is 
a summary of the steps that need to be taken assuming that we have already 
notified them that they needed to post collateral: 

1. An Event of Default occurs upon their failure to post collateral within 2 
Business Days after notice of such failure is given to them by us.  

2. Once an Event of Default occurs, then we can elect an early Termination 
Date.  The ""Loss: method applies here.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, we 
need to coordinate closely with whoever will be doing the Loss calculation 
(and it should not be Fred or someone in his group) to make sure that they 
have the appropriate back up.  We would send a notice declaring an Early 
Termination Date once the Event of Default had occurred and then subsequently 
provide them with our calculation of the Termination Amount.

As I mentioned in my voice mail message, I need copies of all of the letters 
that we have sent to them along with copies of the confirmations of all 
outstanding trades.

All notices will need to be sent by federal express delivery such that they 
won't be effective until the day after they have been sent out."

Gang:

The final letter and document will be given to the Speaker shortly.  As you
may know, TURN ultimately decided not to participate.  Also, late last week
the Utility Workers had an elected change of leadership and there was not
enough time to bring the new officers up to speed by our deadline.

The Speaker plans on using our product to simultaneously encourage the PUC
not to close the door on direct access and, if necessary, convince the
Legislature to pass this year a meaningful direct access program (if the PUC
goes south on us).  Also, I believe he hopes that our work will help
convince the Legislature to move to restore SCE to financial stability - and
to do so rapidly.

This last month has been very interesting to me - ""oddly satisfying"" is how
I described it, even if most of you did object to the phrasing - and I
appreciate the opportunity of working with you.  For whatever reasons, there
is nothing like an intractable social and political problems to get me
interested.  Thanks very much for participating.

"Hey guys,

PSA's are a hot topic, and I have a call into Lisa Bills to discuss it.  Lisa 
has been out of town for a few days, as has the GF TurboPark lawyer, Rose 
Engeldorf.  Rose is being seconded to ENA for TurboPark issues, and will be 
back in the office tomorrow.  We should sit down with Rose and puzzle through 
the issue.  

As for the ""standard"" EECC form PSA, it is a real bear.  Carlos has recently 
worked on a TurboPark/97-10 compliant form, and is waiting for Global Finance 
blessing.  He was going to talk to Bart about his experience, which could 
also add some extra insight.

When you guys have some time it is probably worth taking a half hour to

Right, Renee. We don't want to do sonething that might inadvertently bust any 
eventual off-balance sheet treatment that might apply. 

Hey, Ann. FYI, our usual form of PSA and Tasking Letter didn't fit these off 
balance structures on Mr. Clark's Ft. Pierce job. There was something of a 
controversy as a result and they had to be re-worked. We don't want to go 
there again.

Kay, Ann, and Steve, do you know if  this project is to be Turbo-Parked and 
if so is the work  that you need the PSA and TL hard cost or soft cost? If 
it's to be Turbo Parked, let's work from the  forms Bart developed for Ft. 
Pierce. Renee, please copy Ann on each draft you turn out, including before 
you launch to the other side.

John,

I have received the following request for a PSA and Tasking Letter between 
ENA and EDSA from Steve Rose.  I want to make sure that the Deerfield 
Project, part of the Florida Greenfield Projects, is not being done through 
Off-Balance Sheet Financing, as this would preclude us from using the PSA 
form of contract.  To this end, I am copying Ann Elizabeth White, the ENA 
attorney on the Florida Greenfield Projects.

Once it is determined whether a PSA and Tasking Letter is acceptable for the 
work, I will proceed accordingly.  

If the Florida Greenfields are being financed through Turbo Park, I believe 
Bart Clark has a Turbo Park form for the landscape artitecture firm being 
used on the Ft. Pierce Project and I could try getting a copy of that from 
him.

Thanks

Renee,

I let you a voice mail message about this on Friday.  We have up until now 
been using the landscape architecture firm of Curtis-Rogers, working under a 
subcontract with Parsons Brinckerhoff, on the Deerfield Beach and South Dade 
sites.  Steve Krimsky has decided that he wants to use EDSA (another 
landscape architecture firm we've used on Pompano Beach) to complete the 
landscaping design work on Deerfield Beach, and to have them work directly 
for ENA rather than as a sub to PB.  I've already discussed this at length 
with Doug Smith, one of the principals at EDSA, and have e-mailed him a large 
quantity of design information and got EDSA kicked off to do the work.  Doug 
is supposed to send me a summary of EDSA's NTE costs for the tasks I 
identified to him, which I will forward to you as soon as I get it.

EDSA is now working on the Deerfield Beach landscaping on the basis of my 
conversation and e-mail, and their preliminary deliverables are due Friday 
March 16 (i.e., the end of this week).  We need to get a PSA and TL set up 
between ENA and EDSA to formalize this arrangement.  I would like you to 
draft these two documents ASAP so that we can get the proper contract 
documents in place as quickly as possible.

I will forward to you via separate e-mails the various documentation you will 
need to help put this together.

I'm working at home today (typical ENA vacation day!), so you can reach me on 
my cell or at home if you want to talk about this.

My numbers are:

Cell:  713-854-4971
Home:  281-655-0185

Thanks in advance for your help with this task.

Regards,

Steve

As things change, so do call schedules.  We conferred and have recommend that:

There will not be a call this week.
Beginning next week, the call will take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT), same call-in number (we hope).
Until the next legislative session starts up, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento.

If you have any alternative suggestions, questions, and/or comments, please let me know. And please forward to others who need/would like to know.

The week of November 13 is the week of the Enron Management Conference in San 
Antonio.  It begins on Wednesday evening, so most people will be travelling 
on Wednesday afternoon.  I will be in the office on Monday and Tuesday that 
week, so those days work well for me for your visit.   I just wanted you to 
know about the conference in case that has an impact on other meetings that 
you might want to have in Houston that week.  Let me know.  I will look

Subject: Houston trip

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

I would like to ask you for a favor. We would like to have Sevil as an intern

Subject: Summer Internship Position


Hi Dr. Kaminski,

As I told you last Monday in Dr. Kao's class I am
looking for a summer internship position in your group
in which I can use my economics background together
with my quantitative skills and knowledge in
electricity markets. Currently, I am a third year
Ph.D. student at the Economics Department of  the
University of Houston. At the end of this semester
I'll be completing my coursework and starting to write
my dissertation which analyzes the access pricing
issue in network industries, especially in electricity
transmission.
I would like to give you a few examples from my
coursework. In addition to basic Statistics I-II and
Econometrics I-II, I have taken ""Macroeconomic
Modeling and Forecasting"" (Time Series) class in which
I learned RATS. In ""Applied Econometrics"" class, it
was given a great deal of attention to the case method
learning approach that involved extensive computer
analysis. We were taught SAS. As a term paper I worked
on electricity demand forecasting. This semester I am
taking ""Special Topics in Applied Econometrics"" course
in which I am being taught Qualitative Dependent
Models, MLE, Panel Data Techniques, and so on, and as
software STATA. Moreover, this semester I am also
taking ""Options Theory and Its Applications"" class and
auditing Dr. Kao's class. I definitely agree with you
in what you mentioned in your lecture last Monday
about the understanding of the options theory as a
necessity in the energy sector.
Besides, I spent my last summer in the Oil and Gas
unit of the World Bank as a research assistant. This
work experience in which I had great exposure to the
energy market issues and my own research area, which
is regulation of transmission pricing (congestion
pricing), made me believe that the ongoing
restructuring of the electricity sector, especially
the transmission network issue, could be well
understood by working in the industry.
Dr. Kaminski, attached you can find my resume. I would
be glad if you could find a chance to review it and
get back to me soon.

Many thanks,

handling that and, if I am not mistaken, has taken of that yesterday.  I do

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at
least BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

Yair:

Attached is my redline.  Call me so that we can discuss the remaining
issues, including:

(1)  Calculation Agent.  We believe that the existing dispute mechanism is
adequate.

(2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for
dual confirms.  This is too confusing.

(3)  Transfer.  We cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too
subjective.

The other changes were not substantive.

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

ERISK ESSENTIALS --
What's New at ERisk.com, 4 May 2001

****************************************************
This week&#8217;s Essentials is brought to you by ERisk Analytics 1.0, the first executive information system dedicated to strategic capital management. Learn more about this comprehensive new software solution and how it delivers enterprise risk management analytics that effectively link risk, capital and shareholder value.
http://www.erisk.com/about/PressRoom/releases/about_pressreleases_043001.asp
****************************************************

WEEKLY REVIEW
http://www.erisk.com/news/weekly/news_weekly2001-05-04_01.asp
This week's economic, banking and P&C insurance news, from an enterprise risk management perspective. Featuring exclusive coverage of this week&#8217;s RIMS conference in Atlanta.

ANALYSIS
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_analyses.asp
?	Who matters most - stakeholders or shareholders?
?	Risk managers neglect overseas operations at their peril.
?	Mobile banking is on the way - but will banks benefit from it?

BASLE RESOURCES
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_basle.asp
Now you can find all ERisk&#8217;s comprehensive coverage of the Basle II proposals on bank capital adequacy in one place: www.erisk.com/news/news_basle.asp. You&#8217;ll find all our recent coverage, including features, event transcripts, news stories, interviews and analysis along with links to other resources, regulatory summaries and rating agency and industry association responses.

BASLE SPECIAL
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_features.asp
Continuing our special coverage of the proposed new regulatory capital rules, we look at Basle&#8217;s approach to operational risk. Rob Jameson explores the proposals to set a regulatory capital charge for op risk, and canvasses industry opinion on how they might work in practice.

VIEWPOINT
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_viewpoint.asp
In this special Q&A, Ashish Dev of KeyBank talks to ERisk about what his bank has discovered so far from its internal testing on the impact of the new Basle proposals. It&#8217;s too early to say for sure, but many banks may not find much reason to improve their risk management practices. You can find out Dev's perspective on the Basle proposal in our iConference archive.

ERisk PRODUCT CATALOGUE
http://www.erisk.com/store/store_product.asp
ERisk&#8217;s comprehensive Product Catalogue is a one-stop shop giving full details of the systems and services available to risk managers. From Algorithmics to Zai*Net, we list the major software vendors, data providers and consultancy firms; as well as details of where to find risk management magazines, research reports, web glossaries, training courses and certification programmes.

Folks-
Ok, here is the plan. We need to draft language on the following issues
(including all the options under each of the issues) that were included in
our Roadmap Document:

Direct Access
Large Customer Utility Service options
Rate Relief
Customer Specific Generation
Renewable Energy

These are the pieces that are NOT covered in other plans, documents, etc. We
need to have the language completed no later than Monday 7/9 at 5:00pm.

I am open to suggestions on how best to handle the work -- maybe assigning
the topics above to folks and then getting together to refine and finalize a
work product? If everyone thinks this is a plan that can work and if there
is a specific topic you would like to tackle please let me know. I would
propose meeting on Sunday at say 3:00 at Mike Kahl's office if that meets
with everyone's approval.


Thanks,
Delaney

Subject: Notice to Global Counterparty

I spoke to Mark Dilworth about our discussion re: Global Counterparty being 
notified via e-mail whenever a customer 'signs' an ETA or GTC. Mark seems to 
think that this methodology is rather difficult, and the liklihood of it 
being accomplished anytime soon is LOW.

There is a report that will be generated with each days trading that will 
identify who our Active customers are (meaning a User ID and Password has 
been issued). That report will give us that day's exposure; exposure meaning 
there was activity for that customer, for that day; no exposure meaning there 
was no activity for that customer, for that day. With activity we would know 
that an ETA had been signed, and then you could go in and see that the GTC 
had been signed off (should be simple, as the GTC would match the Product 
Type being traded). This report would identify new customers as they traded, 
but would not identify those customers that sign an ETA and do not do any 
trades.

Mark has agreed that our idea is certainly do-able for Phase 2.

Sara,

Per your conversation with Phil Levy, attached please find our proposed
amendment to the Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement currently in
place between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  I
have reviewed the definition of ""Specified Swap"" as defined in Part 1(2) of
the Schedule and it does not appear to include foreign exchange
transactions.  Therefore, I have modified the definition in the amendment.

Please review the amendment and, if satisfactory, arrange for the execution
of two copies.  Both copies should then be returned to my attention at 270
Park Avenue, 40th Floor, New York, New York 10017.  In addition, once
executed, I would appreciate your faxing me a copy at 212-270-7368.  Once I
receive the originals and have them executed by Chase, I will return to you
one fully executed original for your files.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.  My
telephone number is 212-270-2673.

Best Regards,

Maureen Ryan

2. Yana is not a member of the Analyst/Associate pool. THIS IS NOT A ROTATION.

Elizabeth...  Can you tell us if the terms of the Formosa Plastics/Sport 
Pipeline deals have changed?  The terms USED to be Formosa got the first 
15,000/day (deal 229875), Sport deal #244626 got the next 5,000/day and Sport 
deal #244627 took the swing.  There have been new deals set up in Sitara for 
November production that don't mirror that.  Formosa deal #463959 starts on 
day 4 (what happened to days 1-3?) and gets the first 15,000/day.  Sport deal 
# 456694 covers days 1-3 but the prices are tiered to include what looks like 
Formosa's volume.  Sport deal #463958 covers the rest of the month but the 
prices don't mirror the first 3 day's prices.  Do you see a problem here??!!

Help!!

Lee  - I agree with your statement that LV needs the PSS.  But not with 
regards to Delta.  I do not know what Delta needs for siting their 
generation.  It is my understanding that generators in the WSCC need PSS's.  
I am trying to locate chapter and verse on that requirement.  It may be a 
size issue (ie - greater than ""x"" MWs of generator size). Don Hammond will 
help me locate the requirement in the morning, and I will get back to you.  
My concern was your e mails seemed to imply I said Delta doesn't need PSS. I 
want to stay silent on that issue.

In any regard, Nevada Power Co requires PSS, that is the reason we are 
obtaining them for all the generators at LVCII.

Kent/Kay-

I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams
advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent
with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).

I left a message for the manager of Transco's Rates Department to call me.  
If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities 
are the same now.  In Jan, the ""true backhaul"" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was 
$.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges.  We actually did 
some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.

I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until 
October, after the summer period?

approved the pro forma tariff sheets included with the filing.
The Commission's order also directed Transco to file actual

Here's another draft:



Note in particular changes in exclusivity (now bilateral), tax abatement 
(exh. A), termination rights, term.  I also made a minor change to dispute 
resolution.  As for their hesitancy to give us trade secrets, these should be 
covered by the confidentiality provisions, although this version is very 
basic (see underlined language).  I just want to make sure we get the gas 
supply contract ASAP. We can do a full blown confidentiality agreement that 
helps.  

I never heard back from Dutch Bumgardner.  I'll get the interconnection 
agreement started on this end, unless you think otherwise.

Hope you are having a good trip.

Subject:	FW: Impact and Influence

The past two years, Enron has offered a very effective two-day session called Executive Influence and Impact.  This is required of everyone at the VP level and above, and participation is definitely tracked.  I thought that the class was very helpful.  360 feedback is solicited prior to the session and is used in a very constructive and focused way to help each participant target two to three areas in which specific actions will be targeted to improve on the participant's leadership in communicating with and motivating employees.  

Enron will now offer this course tailored for Directors and Senior Directors.   I would like to have all directors and senior directors in our organization take advantage of this opportunity.  Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot out a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors.  I want to work with the entire management team to create that plan, as sessions will be offered in May, September, November and February (2002).  

However, today is the deadline for registering participants for the first session, May 16 and 17.  This will be given in Houston.  I would like to have several participants from our team in this first session.  My suggestion would be that Brenda Herod and James Scribner attend as senior directors and that we also extend this opportunity to Shona Wilson and Thresa Allen as directors.  I have asked Hector to secure four spots for us, using these names as participants.  If this timing does not work, please let me know and we can determine who could be substituted for the May session.  We would have to name a sub right away, so please get back with me ASAP and confirm that the four names that I have suggested will be able to attend, or let me know your recommendation on a substitution.  
Thanks.

"Hi Carolyn,

In addition to my comments regarding the definitions, here are some other 
thoughts:

Letter agreement:

I would bracket [Spawn], since we don't have it formed yet and we probably 
haven't checked on availability.  

2. Closing date should be at least five but no more than 10 business days.  2 
(a)  Facility Agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than Turbine 
Contract.  Not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology.

3. Make the guaranty for this agreement and the LLC agreement. 

5 (d)  change 1st ""shall"" to ""'may"".

7 (b) does this make sense?  Should we also have the right to specific 
performance?

9.  (iii) consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing 
of the letter agreement.  Should say by closing such will have been 
obtained.  I haven't done a reg evaluation, so I would delete the reg rep 
unless you are comfortable.  I want the HSR risk to be with them, so I don't 
want to contradict it with the rep.

I'll review the LLC agreement next.

Kay

The Dunn Committee will be taking up the contempt citations again on Tuesday, 
July 10.  We are currently contemplating two actions.   First, we intend to 
offer to produce some documents, most notably the ISO bid data sought (which 
the Committee already has anyway).  Secondly, as we do not expect this 
voluntary partial production to placate the Committee, we are preparing an 
action to file in federal court in Sacramento on Monday challenging the 
subpoena to the extent it seeks to require the production of documents other 
than those we offered to produce.  Robin Gibbs and Mike Kirby are on board 
with this.  Please let me know if would like any additional information about 
these matters.  Thank you.

them about all the activiy that is about to start up.

In order to identify and coordinate all of this, we would like to have a team

Vince,

FEA has arrived at a very simple, direct, and inexpensive approach to
licensing our two VaR-related patents as a package.  I hope that you will
agree that our proposed license fee of $2,500 plus $1 per employee, with
licenses to go to all of your affiliates, would be an attractive offer.  I
would love to sign up Enron for this package as an early customer.  Do you
think you could forward the attached pdf license agreement to the
appropriate people at Enron, together with your recommendation? I am highly
motivated to get Enron as a licensee, and I strongly believe that it will be
a worthwhile effort for both parties.

The Governor's office wants more information about what the meeting would 
""look like""/attendees, and has said that the idea sounds like one worth 
pursuing (but as we know, talk is very cheap with this Governor).
In response, Tyson and her very able helper are taking the 1.5-pager that I 
sent around and modifying it to describe the meeting 
optics/logistics/attendee attributes, etc.
They will forward it to me as soon as they've got it drafted.
Tyson hopes the document will seal the deal on the Governor's participation.
In the meantime, Tyson is trading calls with Doer and trying to line up other 
business face cards to assist in getting the business community to the 
table.  Any help/suggestions we can offer gathering up business folks would 
be useful, but seems that Tyson's going to have to carry that water.

Tim,

I hope things are going well in Resco.  I think somebody from Resco (or 
Research) may be interested in the email I received below from Brad Davids.  
Brad is now working at Abacus who works with residential customer patterns as 
well as predictive modelling.  He's going to be here the 25 and 26 of this 
month.  I'm not sure who is responsible for Resco Marketing, but I think they 
would find this interesting.  Who should I send this to?   Please let me know 
if anybody in Resco may have any interest.

Thanks,

Steve

PS:  Vince, simply an FYI since they do focus on modelling and research.

Subject: RE: Possible Meeting?


Steve:

I'll see if I can get in on the 25th . . . will let you know, but I think
it'll work.

Just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be
interested, Abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying
behavior in the world (89 million US households, 3 billion+ purchases),
along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer
response to various offers at the household level. Given the critical need
to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets, we believe
that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct
marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to
whatever the offer is--improving the efficiency of mailings and other
promotional campaigns (so there is an efficiency angle, see!)

Because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on
actual purchases, our results tend to be significantly more predictive than
demographic-based models. So far, the the response from utilities and ""new
entrants"" I've been talking to so far has been quite positive, and we have
some tests of our data underway, but we're interested in talking to as many
players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet
utility needs.

I can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested, but
I guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to
arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25th of April with whoever at Enron
might have interest in hearing what we're up to, and (most importantly)
listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets.

Thanks very much for any help . . . I look forward to catching up and
hearing how things are going for you.

Regards,

Brad Davids

"Some thoughts --

1. We argue against the PJM Installed Capacity obligation.  Basically it is 
another rent capture system for generators.  

2. Don't really understand your stranded cost recovery scheme.  Looks like a 
transmission level charge.  Is it $/mw or $/mwh?  

3. Your model for a pool doesn't solve the key problem of market power.  
Putting a pool in place w/o dealing w/ market power is a recipe for disaster.

4. You don't talk about ""Market Based Rate"" authority.  Would all generators, 
including incumbent generation be allowed to bid their price or must they bid 
cost?  This is critical.  This is the real carrot to get the Utilities off of 
the stick - mandatory participation with cost-based bidding for Incumbents 
until under 1,000 (?) HHI.

Good luck,

Jim

Subject: Recommendations for Japanese Electricity Reform

Please find attached the latest draft of the Brattle Group's recommendations 
for the Japanese power industry and the accompanying appendices.

You will find changes in emphasis and structure, which make the paper more 
convincing, comprehensive and readable. We have tried to include a global 
view of market objectives in keeping with your approach in Houston, to give 
better explanations of why our recommendations are right for Japan at this 
stage and to address potential objections from deregulation's critics in 
Japan.

In addition to its earlier content, the new draft:

includes a new section setting up the objectives of a competitive market and 
defining a workably competitive market, before making specific 
recommendations to achieve those objectives in Japan;

addresses objections by utilities, etc. in Japan to our proposals. Current 
opinions or issues circulating in Japan include: California crisis, 
discrediting of a tight pool, success of PJM ensured by lack of requirement 
to unbundle, nuclear power development;

emphasizes the need for a strong, independent regulator given METI's recent 
inability to provide clear rules to support its recommendations and lack of 
expertise in the Fair Trade Commission;

de-emphasizes final section on public policy issues to emphasize market 
structure, by merging the public policy issues into one section, placing 
reliability at the top of the list and providing alternatives to achieve 
nuclear policy issues;

proposes implementation timetable in keeping with Japanese review process;

takes a punchier, more urgent approach in the executive summary and the paper 
as a whole.

The paper will be published as a Brattle Group paper commissioned by Enron 
Japan. Much input has been provided by Enron Japan but the economic arguments 
and general approach are in keeping with Brattle's written positions and 
standards. The written style of the paper is, of course, theirs.

We would appreciate any comments you might have on the contents of this 
paper. Since we will release the paper on 15 May and will create completed 
published versions in both English and Japanese by 11 May, please send us any 
comments by the end of this week, i.e. Friday, 4 May.

comes up from time to time and we'd like to hear your thoughts re taking on

Hello Mark -- The European Energy Committee meeting was held in London
today. The attached documents, including the agenda, a memo on the
Bridge
agreement, and a copy of the Bridge agreement, were reviewed at this
morning's meeting.

Much of the discussion focused on explanation of the Bridge Agreement.
There
was some discussion about the German regulatory structure and the bridge
agreement.  Katia ran through the agenda in Houston and asked for ideas
on
December conference.  I was not able to hear all of the questions
entirely
but questions were asked about the outcome of the meeting.  Katia and
Christophe explained that it was a forum to exchange ideas and to
promote
use of ISDA within industry. The minutes should give us more detail.

In addition to a call re: the NA agenda, I think it would be worthwhile
to
also have a call w/Christophe, Katia and John Berry to discuss European
activities and to begin discussion on the December agenda. ISDA should
begin
to focus on an agenda as soon as possible so that we assure December's
conference is as productive as the Houston conference.  Thanks!

played  last night with Grant and 2 other guys (only the second time I've 
ever played doubles with Grant) - my forehand/backhand down the line won some 
respect (thanks to our practice sessions no doubt) but my net game continues 
to be wobbly, shaky, timid, erratic , random.... in a word, pitiful.  So here 
is to continued improvement - See you at 1130 on Thursday, court 1.

Also Genia sent you by email our EEI cover sheet last week but she just left 
me a message saying you may no have rec'd it.  Did you get it?  If not I'll

My only comment to this is to please make sure the contracts have IMNE and 
IMME as desks since most of them will be market area deliveries.  They are
already in Unify and the multiple desks may be all we need to path them.  The 
Transco schedulers are also going to have to know the receipt and delivery
points that are primary for all these contracts with Transco changes among 
other things.

Vince,

Here is my edited version of the software license agreement.    Can you read 
it once before I forward it for internal approval?   I specified that the 
$100,000 covers a single  user  perpetural license,  access to source after 
one year,  and covers maintenance and support for one year.

Any suggestions?

"I am not completely convinced that our attendence would be constructive.  
First, I assume that we can enter testimony into the docket without being a 
witness at this hearing.  Second, the way the hearing has two groups (a) good 
guys with facts finding the guilty and (b) the apologists for the guilty 
makes it difficult for me to know which panel I would recommend that we 
join.   Our message doesn't seek to find blame just solutions.  Finally, 
given the upcoming FERC hearing, why not make our case in that process where 
I think the witch hunt mentality won't be so high?

I can be persuaded otherwise on this case.   Either way, however, my 
assumption is that we need to work toward getting FERC informed and ready to 
do the right thing and manage the CPUC and other CA issues to do no harm.

Subject: Re: Comments on Wholesale Issues  

I spoke w/ Bill Julian, Cmmr. Wood's Advisor, about the hearing that is being 
held on Friday, September 8 in San Diego.  There will be a morning panel and 
an afternoon panel.  The morning panel will discuss ""pricing 
behavior/patterns"" and the afternoon panel will provide 
explanations/refutations of the morning presentations.  I'm not sure yet who 
will be speaking, but I have inquired from Steve Weisman, who appears to be 
heading this effort.  

Do we want an Enron representative on the panel?  Who would be the best 
witness?

While this investigation has the opportunity to turn into a witch hunt, I am 
also concerned about the record being developed in such a way as to lead to 
the conclusion that Wood, or the legislature, have in mind.  This could mean 
an attempt by the Commission to assert more regulation in the market, assert 
more state (vs. federal) jurisdiction, build a case for collapsing the ISO/PX 
into one organization, or hang blame on generators and scheduling 
coordinators.

I think Tim and Mary's presentation would be very effective in showing the 
other (real) side of the story.

The following is an exerpt from the pre-hearing conference transcript held on 
8/28 from Cmmr Wood:

27               I am not going to sit here and say that it's not 

           28    an appropriate time to assign blame.  If there has been 

            1    wrongdoing, we will assign blame.  We will ferret out the 

            2    wrongdoers, and we will bring them to account to the 

            3    greatest of our ability. 

            4               But I think that, as Judge Wetzell pointed out, 

            5    the scope of this proceeding is quite broad.  We are not 

            6    only addressing the immediate issues, but we are also 

            7    addressing the underlying problems of this market which 

            8    clearly is not functioning, which clearly is broken. 

            9               We have to look at problems with the structure of 

           10    the market, we have to look at problems with the behavior of 

           11    market participants; and getting beyond the wholesale 

           12    market, we have to look at the interaction with the retail 

           13    market because, after all, that's where the pain actually 

           14    occurs.  That's what consumers themselves face.

           15               There are probably implications for the long-term 

           16    viability of California's utilities that are connected with 

           17    this proceeding, and we have to get into that.  And for that 

           18    reason, as well as the fact that the other utilities in 

           19    California are going to be coming out of the rate freeze at 

           20    some point in the future, we have to consider the statewide 

           21    implications of what we're doing. 

           22               So this is not just the San Diego proceeding, 

           23    although we are focused on events here in the San Diego 

           24    area.

Subject: Comments on Wholesale Issues

Wood, the Assigned Commissioner in the investigation of wholesale electric 
markets, has asked for comments on the following questions by Friday, 
September 8.  We are an individual party to the case as well as a member of 
ARM and WPTF.  

This would be a good opportunity to get our version of what is wrong on the 
record.  The presentation that Tim and Mary put together for FERC will be 
helpful in answering these questions.  I will take a first cut at drafting 
response to be circulated by Tuesday of next week.  We can take liberties in 
providing responses that go beyond the question asked.

Market Structure:

Are the market conditions currently being experienced (price spikes and suppy 
shortages) inevitable under the current market structure?
Do generators and/or scheduling coordinators have market power?
Is there a need to mitigate such market power?
Which market participants or other entities are responsible for reliability 
planning?
Do California regulatory agencies have adequate jurisdiction to ensure 
reasonable prices and reliable service?
Do the structures and governance of the Cal ISO and PX adequately support the 
goals of providing reasonably priced and reliable service?

Market Rules:

Are there rules which allow or encourage unacceptable market outcomes?
What roles, if any, do underscheduling in forward markets, out of state 
transfers, uniform PX auction prices and ISO real-time and out-of-market 
purchases play in the outcomes being experienced?

Behavior of Market Participants:

What is working and not working in terms of price, reliability, information 
exchange, resource distribution, equity, service quality, and types of 
planned generation?

Subject: PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT



 Elizabeth & Janet:

Attached is a draft of the memo we spoke about the other day.  We tried to 
come up with as many arguments as possible, recognizing the strong commercial 
desire to put in the second interconnect.  As we have discussed, certain 
language in the Interconnect Agreement is troublesome, generally due to the 
fact that it does not appear that a second interconnect was contemplated at 
the time the project was initially developed.  Nonetheless, we believe that 
Caledonia does have a number of arguments in favor of the position that it 
should be able to build the second interconnect without a contractual block.  
The strength of some of these arguments will turn in large part on further 
factual development with the commercial group, as noted in a number of places 
in the memo.

Please let me know when you wish to follow up.  And, as I noted in my 
conversation with Elizabeth this morning, there is a possibility I may be in 
Houston next week and perhaps we could meet with the commercial folks at that 
time.  I think it would be advisable to walk through the various possible 
scenarios/strategies with them so that we have the benefit of the TVA 
""history"" and likely responses of TVA to some of the arguments noted in the 
memo.

Thanks  John

"Folks:

We're getting down to the wire.  The Legislature has failed to come up with a solution.  The Treasuer (Angelides) has been marketing the bond issuance.  The key component of his sales pitch to investors is his guarantee that the PUC will suspend DA at its August 23rd meeting, period.  Loretta's in a box with few options other than suspension.  

Attached is a proposal that Sue and I pulled together yesterday (all defects, errors, lapses of judgment, etc., included in the proposal are mine, not Sue's).  It's got two options:

Option A
Cap DA at the net short position for the next 12 months on a first-come-first-serve basis.  ""New"" DA customers would pay fixed charges for 1) utility past debt and 2) the bonds to cover DWR purchases from Jan to present.  ""New"" DA customers would be exempt from DWR long-term charges, however.  ""Old"" DA customers would be exempt from everything.  Absent legislation addressing DA, PUC would revisit in 12 months.

Option B
No cap on DA eligibility.  However, ""New"" DA customers would pay fixed charges for 1) utility past debt, 2) the bonds to cover DWR purchases from Jan to present, and 3) above-market costs of DWR contracts. ""Old"" DA customers would be exempt from everything.  Absent legislation addressing DA, PUC would revisit in 12 months.

Clearly, these are not ""first best"" DA constructs.  But the situation we face is arguably binary----DA suspended altogether, or a significantly compromised DA market, but a market, nonetheless.

Tomorrow is a meeting of the Direct Access Coaltion, where Sue and I intend to present the options and attempt to get ""everyone"" on board.  If successful, we would file the proposal (as a very large coaltion) with the PUC on Friday, accompanied by a noisy press release.

Please review and determine if there are defects in the options that would prevent us from going forward.

We'd like to discuss further on today's 1:30 (CDT) California call.

Best,
Jeff

All I know is as follows    On March 27,2001 the Commission issued a scoping 
memo in 00-11-002.  The scoping memo added the issue of the adequacy of 
SoCal's transmission system to the issues to be addressed in this proceeding.

An ALJ ruling dated April 26,2001, provided that the adequacy of SoCal's gas 
transmission system and the effect on its customers be bifurcated from the 
other issues in this proceeding.  The ALJ's ruling provided that any party 
filing testimony on March 23,2001 would be allowed to file supplemental 
testimony on the SoCal capacity issue.

SoCal filed supplemental testimony.

We are not a party. We need to know if it is too late to become a party, if 
we wanted to. Also was any other supplemental testimony filed by other 
parties??

Dear Dan and Gary,

     Given the FERC order for refunds from the power producers, I think
that the time has come for a serious paper critiquing the underlying
analyses and explaining market fundamentals.  Analytic errors are a
prominent feature of the Cal ISO ""Report"" on supply costs (February 28,
2001), and I would be surprised if the same were not true of the FERC
order and any supporting analyses that may have been prepared.  (Dan is
sending me a couple of relevant FERC documents now, but I will not be
able to review them in detail until Tuesday or Wednesday.)  In general,
however, it is fair to say that a common set of analytic errors
underlies such bureaucratic thinking, and the dangers inherent in the
ISO and FERC orders suggest that a detailed refutation is something that
ought to be done.  The central points that I believe I would make
include the following, among others.  (I'm using a small amount of
economic jargon here that I would not use in a report, but I really am
quite experienced at making such arguments in plain English.)

    1. Such analyses typically are incomplete, in that they ignore (a) a
risk premium for non- or under- or late payment.  They ignore also (b)
the fact that part of the marginal cost of selling today is the forgone
opportunity to sell tomorrow, given that units have to be taken down for
maintenance and the like.  In this sense, electricity can be ""stored"" in
the form of dispatch availability, and it is in the interest of
consumers for suppliers to produce when supplies are needed the most,
i.e., when (expected) prices are highest.  This is true even during a
stage 3 alert: Suppose, for example, that even greater problems are
foreseen for the ensuing summer.  Accordingly, this is not
""manipulation.""  In addition, as explained in my paper in the current
issue of Regulation, (c) market prices under competition include a price
premium for the provision of optimal reliability.  These three
components of cost are important, with measurement requiring econometric
and other tools; and they perhaps are impossible to ""verify"" in
regulatory methodology.

    2. The ISO and FERC analyses confuse marginal and (average) variable
cost, average and marginal producers, average and marginal units of
production, etc.  Other errors are likely as well: The ISO, and, I
suspect, FERC implicitly assume away rising input prices as demand
conditions increase.  This would yield in perfectly competitive markets
a supply curve steeper and a market price higher than measured ""marginal
cost.""  Moreover, the ISO, and, again, FERC in all probability,
implicitly assume perfectly elastic supply at whatever input ""costs""
happen to prevail.  That is simply incorrect: In the short run,
production capacity is limited, so that even if input prices do not rise
with demand, there is a ""kink"" in the competitive supply curve.  If
demand intersects supply above the kink=02=05that is, if the amount demande=
d
exceeds production capacity at the ""marginal cost"" that the regulators
measure=02=05price will exceed that ""marginal cost.""  Think about the
wholesale market for wheat, for example, which is close to a perfectly
competitive market.  In the face of bad weather in some agricultural
regions, the market price of wheat will rise, even though ""costs"" for
the remaining wheat farmers=02=05labor, insecticide, land rents, fuel, wate=
r,
etc.=02=05will not have changed, and indeed might actually fall because of
reduced demand from farmers affected by the adverse weather.

     3. The ISO report admits explicitly that it does not know market
marginal cost, because it complains that some suppliers bidding above
the ""soft cap"" have not submitted cost data.  Moreover, marginal cost
properly defined is for the market as a whole, rather than just for the
producers who bid in California.  This means, quite literally, even
apart from all of the other problems, that the conclusion of
""uncompetitiveness"" or ""unreasonableness"" cannot follow from the ISO
analysis or from what is likely to be the underlying FERC analysis,
because price will equal the marginal cost (defined correctly) of the
last unit produced in a competitive market.  In short: The sort of
analysis offered by the ISO and FERC cannot even in principle determine
competitive prices because the regulators lack data for marginal cost
for the marginal producer.

     4. The implicit definition of consumer welfare (""wellbeing"") used
by most regulators is incorrect.  Consumers are interested not in low
electricity prices alone, but in a maximization of the value of the
entire consumption basket.  Average electricity prices lower than
marginal cost reduce consumer welfare by engendering resource use in the
electricity sector that is too big, and thus prices in other sectors
that are too high.  Moreover, price controls of whatever form must
create shortages even in markets with inelastic demand, and the true
price with a shortage is unambiguously higher than the price that would
clear the market in the absence of the controls.  (Think about the
""cost"" of electricity during a blackout.)  This is easy to demonstrate
analytically.
     The ISO and FERC clearly are shunting aside the effects of price
controls masquerading as ""refunds"" upon long run expectations and other
parameters, which easily can be shown to make consumers worse off over
time.  Part of this problem is the creation of an asymmetric
distribution of expected returns, since suppliers clearly will not be
subsidized when prices are low.

     5. The ISO errs in its assumption that bids above the soft cap
reflect higher capital costs.  I would not be surprised if FERC is
making a similar error.  Capital costs, having been sunk, cannot affect
short run pricing; the differing engineering efficiencies of generating
units will be reflected in their market values, and thus the opportunity
cost of production.  This means, in a strict textbook sense, that
different generating units cannot have costs that differ, as
counterintuitive as that sounds.  More efficient units will have lower
fuel costs (for example), but higher opportunity costs for employment of
the capital assets.  I would make this point in a report, simply to
erode the credibility of the regulators, but I would not push it too
hard, since some people cannot understand it.

     6. The Report ignores the market power of the respective regulatory
bodies as monopsonists under the implicit system of price controls and
refunds.

     7. The definition of ""market power"" is entirely obscure, except
implicitly as bids higher than marginal cost as measured by the
regulators.  This is incorrect, and I think that this needs to be
explained clearly.



     I am sure that other errors and omissions will emerge as the
relevant documents and arguments are reviewed.  Anyway, I'd like to
prepare such a report.  I would have to see precisely what it is that
must be refuted, but my guess is that this is about a two-week project
in terms of required analytic and writing time.  An effort to measure
marginal cost correctly would be a good deal more involved and
time-consuming, and my sense is that at this stage a refutation is more
important.  If it is a two-week project, then I think that $15,000 would
be reasonable.

    Looking forward to hearing from you.  Ben

"This provision is an election which we have added to the Schedule for 
governmental entities.  I believe that it is intended to eliminate any 
confusion that historically arose during the debate between ""First Method"" 
(one-way payments) and ""Second Method"" (two-way payments) for Early 
Termination purposes.  Although I can't find a good reason to continue to use 
this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point), I can 
understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a 
governmental.  The only example that I could locate was our September 21, 
1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District.  For those of 
you who have never seen this form, it was one of the two types of master 
agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA.  Because 
these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties, we had to add many 
of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions.  The Part 
5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement.  It was 
included in the ""Event of Change"" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the 
ISDA concept of ""Illegality"", a ""Termination Event"").  I think it was 
probably included because in the ISDA, Second Method is the automatic payment 
method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early 
Termination purposes, but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ECT 
form.

Work Week
COMPANIES CRACK DOWN on the increasing sexual harassment by e-mail.

Using computer-monitoring devices provided by Enron Software Inc., 
Burlington, Mass., 20th Century Fox scans employees' e-mail to stop the flow 
of sexually offensive messages, says Jeff Uslan, manager of information 
protection. After an e-mail harassment incident, Image First, a New Castle, 
Del., uniforms maker, notified workers that e-mail will be reviewed for any 
violation of its antiharassment policy.

Fully 31% of more than 1,000 human-resources officials surveyed by 
Philadelphia labor-relations lawyer Stephen Cabot and the American Management 
Association reported that employees have sometimes gotten sexually harassing 
e-mails; 85% of the employers have policies to avert problems. Employers 
including First Union Corp., Charlotte, N.C., have fired people recently for 
sending harassing e-mail.

Unlike in-person conduct, e-mail harassment is easy to prove since the 
electronic trail documents allegations, says Kathleen Neville, a 
sexual-harassment consultant.

Michelle,

A few months ago, TW Marketing and Fac. Planning had a meeting to discuss TW CAS system issues. At this meeting, you indicated that the TW Marketers would like to have some training on CAS. I have discussed with Perry Frazier & he would like to set up 30 minute one on one hands-on training sessions with each individual. 

Can you coordinate with your team & identify a list of TW Marketer's who would like to have CAS training? I will work with Perry to schedule the training times.

Thanks Ramona"

Message sent from the pjm-customer-info mailing list at

The FERC staff recently released a report discussing markets in each of the
regions titled ""Investigation of Bulk Power Markets"". The report is not a FERC
Order.

The Northeast region is discussed in a section of 100 pages in length. PJM is
discussed in detail beginning on page 1-59. There are some minor inaccuracies 
in
the report with respect to PJM, such as the 1999 Peak Load.

The report is a good first step in understanding the complex markets in the
Northeast and their relationships among each other. The report also contains
recommendations and options for resolution of issues.

"Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over 
Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a 
brochure.  Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have 
only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two 
beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds.  
Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two rooms, 
one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would probably do 
that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five is almost too 
many in one room and bathroom.  

I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving sounds 
like a good plan.  Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and ask 
about the San Antonio/Sun City crowd?

Hello, Sista -

Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well) -
and here's the latest idea:

Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, how
about we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - during
THanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at that
time - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks maybe
we could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the Thanksgiving travel
MADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which may
help you.

Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom and
dad would like that.

Thoughts?   -Cara

"John,

This is a resume I received today from  my friend.
Please, take a look at it. What follows below is a copy of his message to
me:


Dear Vincent,

I very much would like to ask you for a career advice. I am looking for new
challenges and new professional opportunities. Possibly there would be such
opportunity around yourself  at Enron Corporation.

I trust that my strongest asset is my intellectual capital and ability to
look from new angles into complex issues. Beside of the experience of
working under Jacob Goldfield an Paul Jacobson at Goldman on the interest
rate swaps and proprietary desks, I was a part of research effort of John
Meriwether group at Salomon Brothers, I headed the European interest options
desk at DKBI in London and I have managed a small hedge fund in partnership
with Albert Friedberg.

 I hold Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT and I have studied under Nobel
Laureate in Economics, Bob Merton.

I very much would like to apply my knowledge of capital markets, trading and
research in the field of energy markets.

With my very best regards and personal wishes,

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 3/25/2002.

With the recent surge in U.S. natural gas prices many analysts are
scratching their heads in disbelief. Of course there will continue to be
volatility, but we believe these higher gas prices are not only
sustainable, but will likely move up through the summer (similar to what
happened in 2000). For the past two months it has become very evident that
U.S. natural gas supply/demand on a weather-adjusted basis is much tighter
than the same time last year. The market has finally begun to realize the
extent of this tightness, as more ""normal"" weather over the past several
weeks has removed a substantial amount of the natural gas storage overhang.
This shift in supply/demand should become even more evident as we move into
the early part of the injection season in April/May. Look for summer gas
injections to be down 30% to 50% from last year's numbers. This should be
the bullish driver of summer natural gas prices.

Next week, we should have even more bullish gas news, as the preliminary
numbers from our first quarter U.S. E&P production survey are likely to
surprise many on the Street. Stay tuned....

I think this is Kinneman's decision.  To the extent that an agreement uses a 
rate that may result in P&L when it is pulled out of the book, that is his 
risk.  Not too big of an issue from my perspective.

Subject: Bear Stearns ""Securities Loan Agreement""

Tanya:

We finally agreed on the guaranty form (the cap is $25 million) and are about 
ready to execute the actual agreement.  I have one question:  in the ISDA 
world, we use ""cost of funds plus 1%"" as the default interest rate.  The Bear 
document provides:

""...interest thereon at a rate equal to (A) in the case of purchases of 
Foreign Securities, LIBOR, (B) in the case of purchases of any other 
securities (or other amounts, if any, due to Lender hereunder), the Federal 
Funds Rate or (C) such other rate as may be specified in Schedule B, in each 
case as such rate fluctuates from day to day, from the date of such purchase 
until the date of payment of such excess.""

What is your preference:  Bear's standard language or do you want to specify 
another rate?

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

Subject: MAC as an Additional Event of Default

John: Thanks for taking the time to read the email. I have not had many=20
responses!

There are two reasons why I drafted the clause in this way.=20

1) It tracks the ""cure"" modification clause for Credit Event Upon Merger (a=
nd=20
I think the cures for both clauses need to be consistent).

2) The wording is useful because it describes what the written demand is=20
asking for - i.e. ""performance assurance"".=20

Maybe there is a more elegant way of expressing #2 - maybe we just use ""for=
""=20
rather than ""therefor"". I was not the original drafter of the CEUM provisio=
n=20
so I don't know why it was written this way but in any event, the concept o=

"Hi Dana:

Please accept my apologies for not having responded sooner.  Things, as you 
know, are, well, a little nuts.  It was great to meet you and I would be 
happy to discuss opportunities.  I need to be in S.D. in the next few weeks.  
Perhaps we could have lunch, or something, and you could fill me in on what 
you folks do.

Best,
Jeff

Hi, Jeff --

It was great to meet you this week while you were in San Diego for the
hearings.  Cathy Van Way and I had a blast catching up on old times and
trying to think of every pun possible that led directly back to electricity.

I know Enron has extensive communications support, but in the future if you
have need on a project or public relations campaign, I hope you'll keep me
in mind.  Although it took me a while to understand the difference between
a megawatt and a megaphone before Rep. Schaefer introduced the first bill,
once I finally ""got it"" I developed an ability to help the media understand
the issue -- so that misinformation, as experienced in San Diego -- can be
avoided.   I've also maintained excellent contacts with the media covering
electricity and can help with corporate pr as well as issue communications.

As you're well aware, the light won't go out on this issue for a long time
(pun practice).

Best regards,

Dana

"Zimin,

Sorry if you get this impression. The real reason is that I treat
the lunch meetings as an opportunity to get updates on things
that are going on at more remote locations. I interact with each of the
members of your group daily and I know what's going on.

I agree with you, however, that the lunch meetings are not exclusively
for my benefit,  but also for the benefit of  the other members of
the group. I shall make sure that you have the opportunity
to communicate  your contribution to the company.

Vince and Stinson,

The valuation group has accomplished a lot during last six months.  The 
number of
projects we are working on is keeping increasing.   However, when comes to the
staff meeting (Thursday lunch meeting), we are often left out for updating 
our projects.
This makes me feel that what we are doing is no longer interesting or worth 
mentioning.

I am hoping that we can get  more exposure, despite we are still in the old 
economy.

Subject: TMR earnings

TMR earnings report tomorrow...

I've been watching this sector -  ie small cap oil&gas.
Most companies have risen prior to earnings, but then have a pretty good 
sell-off
after announcing record earnings.

Examples: 
 CHK earnings report on 2/20 stock price=$10.80, by 2/24 stock price = $9.10.
 GW earnings report on 2/12 price = $6.70, by 3/1 price $5.05.
 OEI earnings 1/25 price $18.05, then 1/30 $16.75 but today $19.00
 DNR earnings 2/23 price + $11.00 by 3/1 $9.70
 CRK earnings 2/14 price = $13.80 by 2/20 $10.20
 
So...buy the rumor, sell the fact ????
I still want to hold TMR long term, but maybe take a little profit tomorrow

		 Subject: Re: In re M/V PACIFIC VIRGO

Paul,

Thanks for your e-mail.  Parenthetically, I'd be happy to explain how we got 
to where we are on our strategy; maybe a telephone call would be best.  Let 
me know when you are available.  I can call you early a.m. or late p.m.  

Re the bug issue:  we were aware of this, although I am interested to hear 
that SGS raised it with you and Eric in mid-October.  I have discussed this 
in the past with David Best, and spoke with him on the telephone this morning 
about what SGS told you.  We don't think we should put anyone on notice about 
the bug issue unless and until it appears and is confirmed at the joint 
testing.  Otherwise, we may be raising an inherent vice argument for both 
Mitsubishi and our own cargo underwriters.   Let me know if you have a 
different view (on this or anything else I put in this e-mail). 

Re Mitsubishi's response to our settlement demand:  David Best has just 
spoken with Sian Heard, Mitsubishi's lead London solicitor.  It is clear from 
her that Mitsubishi will not be settling prior to instituting arbitration.  
It is also clear that Mitsubishi will not consider any substantial settlement 
without Heard's advice.  Best believes that Heard will recommend that the 
joint testing take place before giving Mitsubishi an exposure evaluation.  In 
sum, while our attempt at settlement prior to joint testing was a worthwhile 
effort, to avoid the risk and expense of the problematic joint survey, it now 
appears to David and me to be at a dead end.

Re the joint testing:  Again, David and I believe that the joint testing 
should proceed as quickly as it can be arranged.  Neither our cargo 
underwriters nor Mitsubishi will move off dead center unless we do so.  Given 
the problems with SGS's lab in Singapore, the ""bug"" issue that SGS in Subic 
Bay has raised (again), and that SGS did the pre-purchase of product for ECT 
that proved off-spec, I have asked David to re-visit with Steve Jones, our 
chemist, the logistics and cost of having the testing done in the U.K.  I 
have also asked him to consider whether Heard might be amenable to splitting 
the costs of transporting the samples from Singapore to the U.K.  I would 
like to get ECT's authority quickly to authorize the joint testing to go 
forward.

Re the selection of arbitrators:  David has discussed three Q.C.s that he and 
Neale agreed were appropriate with Hearn.  Of those three, Hearn likes 
Nicholas Hamblin, who will charge 275 pounds an hour, and $1,750 pounds per 
day.  She will be conferring with Mitsubishi about using him as the sole 
arbitrator.  Given that we have initiated a good-faith discussion of the 
choice of arbitrators with Mitsubishi, David advises that we do not need to 
worry about sending Mitsubishi a letter tomorrow with our choices of 
arbitrator on it.  We can wait for Hearn to respond, then I will make a 
formal request for your authority to agree to one arbitrator who has already 
been accepted by Mitsubishi.

Re the without-prejudice settlement of Mitsubishi's freight and demurrage:  I 
read you loud and clear (and thanks for making clear that the freight claim 
is only about $500,000, not $760,000, as I had inadvertantly indicated in my 
last e-mail).  As I previously mentioned, David and I are on board with this 
idea, given the difficult circumstances of this case.

Let me know if I have inadvertantly mischaracterized anything you said.

Britt

britt,

thanks your reply which is noted. you will notice i have excluded david best 
and ngregson (?) preferring to keep my comments in house as privileged info, 
unless you feel this msg should be forwarded to them later.

firstly, i am getting nowhere with mitsubishi on the settlement front. i have 
gone so far as to mention this morning to mitsuru that if this does goes to 
arbitration, and should mitsubishi succeed in their position, this will only 
serve to increase our claim by a similar amount since these costs would then 
become part of our contamination claim. he seems quite content to let this go 
to arbitration. as an example, he was suppose to call me back this afternoon 
but did not.

secondly, with regards to your comments, i would just respond/add the 
following information:

1. i don't know if i am switching tactics so much as following what should 
have been done in the beginning (i.e. submit the claim to our insurance 
company and let them proceed against the owners). i honestly feel the 
arbitrators will say, ""pay the freight (and possibly the demurrage now) and 
settle the contamination claim as a separate issue"". clearly, the c/p says 
that freight is due without deduction once the vessel has completed discharge.

on the issue of the ""pre-sale"" survey, i have discussed this matter 
internally with eric tan. seems our position is that singapore considered the 
sample that was drawn as a bad sample as well as we were not sure that the 
test methods used conformed with the testing methods required for first gas. 
this position is proved by the loading of the pacific virgo when the product 
subsequently tested on-spec for first gas. granted, it might still become an 
issue but, as you say. it could become an issue in either proceeding.

i am getting a little confused on the matter of the joint testing. verbally i 
was advised that enron did not want to have the joint testing - at least not 
on a prompt basis. your msg now says that we do want to test the product and 
it should be done as soon as possible (as mitsubishi - and your advices that 
the underwriters and hear owner's p and i club would want). i assume this 
change is the result of the arbitration. 

be that as it may, i do have a bit of information that you may, or may not, 
be aware of or find relevant. when eric tan and i visited first gas in 
mid-oct to meet the personnel at first gas and witness one of the cargoes 
being discharged at the plant, we also took the opportunity to meet with sgs 
in subic bay to see their facilities and meet their personnel. during the 
conversation the subject of the elang cargo came up and the comment from sgs 
is that they were fairly certain it was off-spec due to ""bugs"". this may 
sound silly but i have heard of this before and is a problem with petroleum 
products.

it seems sgs even went so far as to test the product themselves for these 
""bugs"" and got a positive result. this test was not requested by enron or 
first gas and was done some time later in this process. i understand there 
may be some concern on our part over our subsequent sales to third parties if 
we knew there were bugs in the product. i would have to say that this was not 
known at the time and even today is only conjecture based on sgs' advices 
mid-oct (well after these sales). sgs also described ""changes"" to the product 
which would fit with the cargo having bugs (i.e. a strong sulphur smell and 
change in colour).

if the testing is now done, i do not know if these bugs will be detected or 
not. however, if they are in the ship's samples, they may have changed the 
sample sufficiently that even a visual observation may detect the problem. 
the next problem becomes proving from where the bugs originated. were they in 
the previous cargo tanks that were not cleaned properly? or were they in the 
condensate when the cargo was loaded? obviously, testing of the shore sample 
prior to loading will determine the answer. if the shore sample is ok, then 
they had to come from the ship. if the shore sample also has bugs, then we 
should be claiming against our suppliers.

this of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct. 
just something else to be considered.

2) i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only the 
freight portion (about $500,000). we then advise mitsubishi (or their 
lawyers) that we will now review the demurrage claim (about $260,000) and 
revert by say end nov. the demurrage claim has been sent to our london 
office's demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on the 
claim. after all, there may be issues with the ship's pumping performance or 
simple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim. they will try to 
get me a response before the weekend.

in this manner, we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portion 
which we may apply against our claim once the test results are known. i will 
leave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or their 
lawyers should be made

"Good draft.  Few comments:

As much as we may not like it, the commission is where the action is right now, and we're going to have to work with them.  As such, I think the comments would be significantly more effective if you go through the document and edit out the invective and other highly charged adjectives, which, while therapeutic, tend to incent the Commission to ignore or be even more hostile to our interests. In short, I don't see an upside to it and there is downside.  Rather than try to edit, I've simply compiled those paragraphs that in my view should be deleted or require serious toning-down. In addition to these specific areas, I would recommend going through the document and toning it down generally.
Seems that it would be useful, up front and at the end, to give OUR answer (maybe I'm repeating Jim's comments here):  e.g., The Commission should 1) not do retroactive, 2) permit customers to do what the contracts permit (e.g., add facilities, renew, etc.), 3) hold hearings on all of Wood's unsubstantiated assertions, and 4) anything else we want to be part of the solution as it relates to the issues raised by Karl.
On page 2, do we run the risk of affirming  what Angelides and others are saying, i.e., that DA could bankrupt the state?  Sure we need to say it, since it seems to play into their spin and everyone already knows of the bind they're in?  Could backfire.
Point # 6 on page 14:  are  we inviting the Commission to ask parties to submit contracts?  Possible to re-write or eliminate this so that it doesn't appear we're advocating having folks submit them?

Good job.  Thanks for your efforts.  Seems that the key thing is to let the Commission know unequivocally that it must hold extensive hearings on the many factual issues in dispute.

Best,
Jeff

Tana, Steven,  here are the last three descriptions



Steven I have a special favour to ask.  All the descriptions were written by 
the commercial groups and they are a bit scanty on regulatory in places.
The following descriptions need some attention which I would appreciate if 
someone from your dept could give. 

LPG  This is missing a complete section.  Is it possible to insert a couple 
of paragraphs here.
US Nat Gas A have written this anfroma alot of material I got fromt he 
group.  However I still feel the reg section is more of a historical 
recounter than a statement of the current environment.  The last paragraph 
mentions about the reg bodies for LDC's.  Is it possible to add a little bit 
more on the current reg bodies and regulations themselves.

Thanks

You and your team have been extremely responsive in trying to get the information that we need.

Sarah, 

As I have not yet heard from Jayshree, I thought I would convey the gist of our phone conversation by e-mail.  

Over the last several days, we in the research group have looked at ORACLE risk management databases and Enrononline data to corroborate the profitability numbers for power and gas trading.  Our analyses yield figures which are substantially at variance with what is normally believed to be the case.  Of course, there may well be information sources we are not privy to.  Moreover, we found some irregularities in the data which only serve to raise our doubts about the quality of the data.

As a result, we are not able to make an authoritative statement about the profitability of power and gas units. As we are not able to intepret the data ourselves, we have provided the spreadsheets so you can draw your own conclusions.  Thanks.

"HEADLINE: Davis faces dire political consequences if power woes linger

BYLINE: By Daniel Borenstein

BODY:

??WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ As Democrats prepare for their first statewide
convention since the electricity crisis erupted, some elected officials and
strategists are warning of dire political consequences if Gov. Gray Davis 
fails
to clean up the power mess.

??""All of us should be thinking about the effect the energy crisis is going to
have on our chances of maintaining control of both houses, and the effect the
governor will have on the ticket up and down,"" said state Sen. Don Perata,
D-Alameda. ""If he has not performed well and he has a D after his name, that
could be problematic.""

??Garry South, the governor's top political strategist, said Thursday that the
state's electricity woes probably won't be over soon, but the voters 
understand
Davis didn't create the problem.

??""It won't be solved in six months,"" South said. ""This is an immediate 
problem
that is not susceptible to an immediate solution. This is a several-year 
process
to get this situation back under control.""

??As for the governor's critics, ""I think they should be asked to produce 
their
own plan. It's awful easy to take pot shots, but most of those who I read 
about
in the newspapers have no plan.""

??The intraparty sniping on the eve of the party convention highlights the
frustration Democrats are feeling about the crisis_and its potential political
damage.

??Four months ago, this weekend's convention in Anaheim seemed certain to be a
Davis fete. Although Democrats had lost the presidency, Al Gore easily carried
California and the party was in firm control of the Legislature and the 
state's
congressional delegation.

??Davis had led the Gore effort in California and the governor was personally
and politically popular across the state. This would have been the convention
for him to showcase his achievements for education, the issue he had promised 
to
make the hallmark of his first term.

??But electricity now overshadows everything else. To be sure, the governor
will tout his policy achievements during a Saturday morning speech to the
convention delegates. And he is not shying away from the spotlight.

??Tonight, he will host a party for the delegates at Disney's California
Adventure Theme Park. That prompted one Democratic consultant from Sacramento
who won't be attending to quip, ""We're in fantasy land here, thank you. We 
don't
need to go to Disneyland for that.""

??Some are shaking their heads in disbelief at how the governor has handled 
the
events of the past week. ""In many ways, he appears to have gone politically 
tone
deaf,"" said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political analyst at Claremont Graduate
University. ""His instincts are not serving him well.""

??While his top aides were meeting with legislators last week to warn them 
that
a $10 billion bond package won't be enough to get the state out of the crisis,
Davis was at a $10,000-per-person Palm Springs golf tournament to raise money
for his re-election campaign.

??When his hand-picked members of the Public Utilities Commission this week
approved an electricity rate hike that experts have been predicting for 
months,
Davis claimed that he didn't know about the plan before it was announced and
that he thought it was premature.

??Other Democrats, however, thought the commission action was overdue. ""I'm
glad to see the PUC stepping out and doing something along the lines that some
of us have been talking about needing to be done for the last six or eight
weeks,"" said state Sen. Tom Torlakson, D-Antioch. ""There's a high level of
frustration. There haven't been clear answers to what the solution is.""

??South, the Davis political strategist, said a lot of factors are outside the
governor's control. ""No one can predict with any certainty where this is going
to go, and no one can predict when this situation is going to be brought under
control. We don't control the generators, we don't control the FERC (Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission), we don't control what Wall Street is going to
do.""

??As for the potential political fallout, South said the governor and 
Democrats
remain in a strong position. After all, he said, the deregulation plan was
pushed through by a Republican governor and Republicans in Washington are
blocking efforts to cap prices.

??Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College, predicted
Davis could weather the electricity crisis. ""People who are following it know
it's roots run deeper than the Davis administration and the Republicans don't
have any plausible alternatives,"" he said.

??""My read of public opinion is people don't think there's a simple and easy
solution and they're not expecting one. They may be impatient but they won't
necessarily take it out on (Davis).""

??It's too early to predict the political outcome, said Mark Baldassare,
pollster at the Public Policy Institute of California.

??""The impacts won't be clear until people have gone through a few billing
cycles and we've gone through the summer blackouts, until we see what the
personal impacts are so we know what the political impacts are,"" he said.
""That's the really crucial period for Gray Davis' political future, after this
summer.""

"Here are my observations:

I agree with Rusty re: the put option complicating things for us.  Second, 
there has to be an absolute end to this agreement at some point. If we want 
to have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still needs 
to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter 
what.  In other words, if we want to add the language Rusty suggested, it 
should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement.  
We'll need to run this back through Accounting.

I really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5. If we add 
the language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back 
through Accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language.  

I don't know if Rusty and Fred think we may need a zoning change for this 
parcel.

Subject: Fehr Option Agreement

I am in receipt of the Fehr's comments to our option agreement.  In reviewing 
them, I have the following comments:

The paragraph (2) change that says they can compel us to buy their land upon 
a Triggering Event occurring is not going to work, because this is a put 
option on their part which hurts our hard cost avoidance issues.  We 
carefully reworded previous put option language to avoid this.    Also, how 
can we be bound to a deal when the agreement has expired ?  I think we would 
need to say that ""if we decide to build the plant after the option period 
expires, then that would serve to extend the term of this agreement, however, 
if the option agreement expires unexercised for a one year period then we 
won't be bound to the deal.  

If the provisions of his comment (5) are indeed parallel to another similar 
paragraph in the document I don't have a problem with it, but ""specific 
performance"" scares me in general.  Your (collective) call.


Lets wrap this one up fast.  I want to resolve it soon so I can use it as 
leverage with Ledford and not have him influence them.  He picked a good to 
go on vacation, but is back in on Monday.  I also told the Fehr's that if we 
could do this before the 15th I would go for $185,000 vs. $175,000.  Since we 
were about five days longer than promised, I can justify the delay to end of 
next week, but I don't want them to think I was just blowing smoke on the 
extra $10,000.


Fred :  Refresh my memory on who I need to go to for the option payment check 
?

Vincent,
Congratulations on spearheading the Mind's Eye Madness event - it looks like
quite a success.  My biggest disappointment is that I am leaving Enron this
week and have been too busy to participate as much as I would like.  I have
had continued interest in the work and presentations that Amy Oberg has
done, so would have really enjoyed the workshop yesterday.  I am still
considering doing some or all of the Motorcade Friday, however that may
work.

Separately, thanks for the update in the lobby today on the Enterprise Risk
project.  Please keep in touch with me.  As I mentioned, my redeployment
period ends tomorrow (April 26), but I currently do not have an outside job
lined up and still have a lot of interest in the project if something can be
worked out over the next few weeks.  Although he is not in the same group as
David Port, I have worked a lot with Brad Larson in the RAC underwriting
group - he may be a good source of information on me also.

"Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving Germany to the 
approved list for trading credit derivatives.  Below is the list, now updated 
to reflect this change.

European jurisdictions which are are approved for trading credit 
derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K..

The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
include:  France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The 
Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may 
be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved 
jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be 
determined on a case by case basis.

Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list."

Hi Mark and Tana

I have been given your name by Justin Boyd as someone who can help me or 
point me in the right direction.

We need to raise a power of attorney to enable Amita Gosalia of Enron House 
to execute EnronOnline Password Applications for each of the above company.  
Please could you let me know if you can prepare such a document and also what 
if any additional information you require.  I have attached a copy of the 
Power of Attorney which we use in the UK for such authority for your 
information.



Unfortunately this is becoming quite urgent and any assistance you can give 
will be greatly appreciated.

Please let me know if you have any queries.

Thanks and regards"

If we are replacing an existing Master Agreement with an ISDA Master 
Agreement, please change the status in the master swap agreement database 
from ""Executed"" to ""Executed-Under Amendment"".  Once a master is executed, 
""Executed"" or ""Executed-Under Amendment"" should be the only two options you 
should ever choose.  If you change it to ""Draft Sent"", ""Under Negotiation"", 
etc., it wipes that counterparty's master from the list of executed masters."
"Here is the form of LLC agreement we used for the Intergen deal, tweaked a 
bit for lessons learned.  I will forward the updated letter agreement which 
has been improved also.  It relates to the Blue Dog turbines, so some of the 
defined terms are different.  I will also forward the Intergen docs so you 
can see some of the definitions, etc.  

One thing which wasn't addressed in the Intergen deal was the potential HSR 
issue (there wasn't one) which arises when the put or call option is 
exercised.  

I also have the TurboPark docs, which I can forward when it gets closer.  I 
don't know if I have the electronic versions of the other closing docs.

We did have a ""form"" LLC agreement in conjunction the letter agreement.  It
was most recently circulated in a Jan 4 e-mail from me and is the attached

provisions of Section 2.5 and depending on whether XYZ is a corporation,

I've set up the exhibits as a separate document to make it easier to move

"Bo,  Attached is the draft of the gas agreement for the StageCoach 
transaction.  There are still a few blanks for which Andrew is getting the 
information.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.



Also to follow up on our discussion from earlier concerning who would 
actually contracts with the PPL for the Utility Agreement;  we had earlier 
discussed Tennessee Gas Pipeline contracting with the Utility with EES acting 
as their agent for interaction with the Utility.  However, I think it should 
be EES who contracts with the Utility to receive electric service.  TGP has 
contracted with ECS for Compression Services and ECS has contracted with EES 
for power.  TGP has no need for a power deal.  Let me know what you think 
about this.

It is my understanding that EES is working on a revised draft of the TA for 
the Power Contract.  Let me know if this is not correct.  Thanks.

"Only couple brief comments on the version that includes Edison's comments:

Under the definition of ""Spot Market Service"" it now reads:

This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose 
service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have 
failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or 
Term Service. 

I don't understand the meaning of the phrase ""or be deemed to elect.""  If 
inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's 
appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing 
it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be 
deleted.

There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison 
provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may 
turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to 
adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let 
folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in 
the near term.
Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the 
green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional 
percentages and consequently we never established a ""zone of comfort"" around 
including those numbers.  That may become an issue (and may not, just wanted 
to briefly flag it).

Thanks again for all the effort.

Best,

I'll give Hedy a call and see if they'd be willing to attend and report back. In my view, given the circumstances, if they've got conflicts and can't make it, I'm not inclinded to push it.

See the proposed wording, below.  This is the only contract text issue I am

Other than the items mentioned in my e-mail of June 1st/2nd (on the
consolidation agreement) and finalization of the ""letter agreement"" (you got

Implied in the above, is that at this point I think the split agreement

I have no problem with their proposed addition as it applies to the onshore
contract.  However, I would recommend modifying it as follows:

      If Purchaser is obligated to make any payment to Seller that
is subject to any withholding tax, then Purchaser shall remit the
appropriate withholding tax to the proper governmental authorities, and
Purchaser shall then remit the net amount of the payment (i.e., the gross
payment minus the applicable withholding tax) to Seller.  Seller agrees to
provide Purchaser with an original tax receipt, in Seller's name, indicating
remittance by the Purchaser of the amounts withheld.  Failure to provide
this receipt within a reasonable period of time will result in the amount
withheld becoming payable to the Seller.

Chris, remember we discussed this on Tuesday aftenoon - When we came in 
Sunday (after physical deals were transfered over to new books) we 
recaculated individual P&L's. Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240) 
was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had  to tranfer the 
difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at 
Friday's P&L.  This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose 
more than you think in Nymex.

On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals  
Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday  resulting in taking the 
Sunday's gain away from your book.  

Let me know if we need to discuss further. thanks.

One of the calculated risks ENA has lived with is the potential 
unavailability of systems given a disaster strikes the Houston area such as a 
hurricane that knocks out power, etc.

Have you given any thought on the commodity logic side of providing a 
hot-backup / fail-over capability from another location ?  This could be 
particularly critical with the Contract Exchange module and might be one 
assurance customers would want before signing up.

For that matter, is there a market in providing disaster recovery / 
hot-backup capability to companies in high-risk areas?  It has traditionally 
been thought of as too expensive to warrant implementing such a capability 
for our own purposes.  Perhaps there are economies of scale that can be 
recognized when providing this capability for many.

Subject: London Research Group

John,

I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.


My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.

His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
greatly improved.

Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

		 Subject: Details on All Employee Meeting

On Thursday afternoon, March 22, at 2:30PM in the Doubletree La Salle 
Ballroom, we will have an All Employee Meeting to discuss Enron Engineering 
and Operations Services (EEOS).  Mark Frevert and Dan Leff will join Brian 
Stanley, John Gillis, and the two of us for this discussion.  Led by Mark and 
Dan, we have been on a corporate journey to determine the best method to 
provide a resource base for the building , operating, and maintaining of our 
existing and planned major assets. The discussions evolved around two major 
issues. First,  most of the engineering and project management resources were 
concentrated in the former EE &CC, but operational resources were spread 
among several groups.  OEC provided operational support to some, but not all 
Enron assets.  Second, the clear need for both the engineering and 
operational resources was in Wholesale not Retail (EES).  There will be some 
need to help EES bridge into Industrial clients, but this need is minor 
compared to the requirements of Wholesale.  As a benefit of the time Mark and 
Dan plus other Executive Committee Members put into the decision  to form 
EEOS, we believe we are correctly positioned to effectively address Enron's 
major project needs.  Our Thursday meeting is an open forum to discuss these 
and other issues you might have with our new or perhaps more clearly defined 
position.  

We look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

Keith Dodson 
Chief Operating Officer - EEOS

Ken Bean
Vice President - Operational Energy Corp.

For ESA to exercise its LM 6000 purchase option, it must pay the Option 
Exercise Price of $101,249,431 (per section 3A of the Option Agreement) plus 
an additional charge of $21,500 per day for each day after November 22d (per 
section 3B of the Option Agreement).  If the option is exercised on December 
20th, the total amount to be paid would be:

Option Exercise Price      $101,249,431
Plus: Additional Costs: $21,500 per day x 28 days =     $        602,000
Option Exercise Price plus Additional Costs  $101,851,431

"I forwarded your picture to Eric and your little comment about you wanting to 
join Quiet Riot has sent shockwaves through the members of Monkey Pump.  
First of all,  you haven't even been voted into the band yet (seems the 
chances are getting less likely with you already shopping your skills on the 
market) and now you already discussing new ventures.  Secondly, Monkey Pump 
is not a stepping stone.  We are big time and those has beens ""Quiet Riot"" 
will wish for just a small portion of our fame and fortune.  

I guess this does add a new dimension to the much anticipated VH-1 Behind the 
Music: Monkey Pump episode.  

""Monkey Pump was on its way, they were only 5 years away from their first 
album, but little did they know that the person who they weren't even really 
sure they wanted to be their lead singer, already had other designs on 
reviving a heavy metal icon from long ago.  When we return on behind the

"Attached is ""Annex B.doc"" which we use to prepare Annex B which contains the 
credit provisions we attach to a Confirmation when such is requested for 
omnibus financial confirmations.  About mid-way through the US Annex B is 
about 4 selections of collateral annexes depending on whether the credit is 
one-way or two-way and whether the collateral requested is letters of credit 
only or letters of credit and cash.  Following that is form of letter of 
credit.  We have an Annex B form for US counterparties and Canadian 
counterparties.  I have attached both.   The law in Canada currently does not 
favor taking cash in Canada and WE DO NOT TAKE CASH (this obviously is quite 
problematic for us!).  Our current advice from Canadian counsel is that Cash 
must be perfected in a way similar to filing a UCC.  The Canadian and US 
lawyers are re-reviewing this situation and I will let you know when/if this 
advice changes.

"Hi John,

I'll be glad to consider using Aaron.  Let me take a look at the agreements 
first, before we commit.  Did Bob Carter work on these agreements?  He might 
have copies, and he won't charge us for them.  At least I don't think he will.

I hope everything is going OK.

With Kathleen's help and Jeff Hodge's review the CA went out on Wednesday via 
email to BPUB.  Mitch and I are reviewing the TEX/MEX agreements to determine 
an appropriate commercial structure with the intent of preserving as much of 
the ""legalese"" in the original agreements (i.e., the development agreement 
and the participation agreement) as possible.  Our major concern is to keep 
this off Balance Sheet.  

 I'll call B &P to see if they have electronic versions.  Would you consider 
having Aaron Roffwarg of B & P work on this agreement, he was previously 
involved in the drafting of the agreements and he knows all of the players 
and their habits.

I spoke with Gordon.  The assets that he knew about were ones that we have already looked at.  I was very nice and told him that I was appreciative of his notifying us about them.  

I owe him a call to tell him whether we are still pursuing these projects or whether we have given up on them.  Gordon wanted to be sure that we had no interest before bringing these projects to his other clients' attention.

Subject: ABB turbines/site marketing agreement

Lisa Bills and I spoke concerning this transaction, and what kind of document 
we can put in front of Peoples at this time.  Here are the highlights from 
our conversation:

Enron can't enter into a binding commitment to purchase the equipment without 
putting the Moore project on the balance sheet.  Therefore, either WestLB 
needs to enter into the agreement with Peoples or Enron can enter into an 
option agreement.  There is room in the WestLB facility for the turbines; 
however, RAC needs to approve the purchase.  Lisa advises that Transaction 
Support (Herman or Roger) needs to buy in as well.

I understand we would like to present a binding agreement to Peoples 
tomorrow, however, this appears to be problematic given the need to keep the 
Moore project off the balance sheet. 

I'm available to discuss this.  Lisa advises that she will be in tomorrow as 
well.

Lisa, please correct me if any of this is not accurate.

Kay

Subject:	Timing for QF meeting with Edison

Jeff - I believe we currently on scheduled for a September 13th conference call with John Fielder to discuss QF proposals.  One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely, given the legislative session end of September 15th(??), that we are going to get much traction.  (Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call).  It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense.  It is an issue of who will listen and who will act.  It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR.  Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed.  

The proposal to DWR could go as follows:  Either  Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction.  Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process.  A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts.  

In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing.  As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE.  (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs.  Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

Let me know your thoughts.

		 Subject: SB 28x problems with the Republicans

FYI:  In caucus today, the Senate Republicans decided to maintain a united
opposition to SB 28x (Sher) when it comes to the Senate floor tomorrow.
Their sole argument is against the  unemployment insurance language inserted
by labor in the Assembly Appropriations Committee. If the bill fails to get
concurrence in the Assembly amendments, the bill will go to a conference
committee where this issue (and possibly others) will be hammered-out by
members of both houses.

Background

   The Hunter Pipeline is an interconnection between facilities of Tennesse=
e=20
Gas
Pipeline Company (Tennessee) and TETCO. It consists of two 1,000 horsepower
compressors and approximately 600 feet of above-ground 10-inch diameter gas
pipeline. The Hunter Pipeline is capable of transporting 60,000 Mcf per day=
 of
natural gas.  [*4]

   Texas-Ohio constructed the Hunter Pipeline pursuant to a certificate iss=
ued
by the Kentucky Public Service Commission (Kentucky PSC) on November 19, 19=
90.
This authorization designated Texas-Ohio as an intrastate pipeline operatin=
g=20
as
a transporting utility. However, because Texas-Ohio did not hold an=20
open-season
prior to commencing transportation operations, only Texas-Ohio Gas, Inc. an=
d=20
its
sales customers acquired capacity on the Hunter Pipeline. n4 After=20
constructing
the facilities, Texas-Ohio filed an application with the Commission in Dock=
et
No. PR91-5-000 seeking approval of rates under section 311(a)(2) of the=20
Natural
Gas Policy Act (NGPA). The Commission instituted rate proceedings on April =
29,
1991 to determine whether Texas-Ohio's rates were fair and equitable. n5

   n4 Texas-Ohio is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Texas-Ohio Gas, Inc. (TOG)=
, a
Houston-based marketer that ships Gulf Coast gas to northeastern industrial
end-users via Tennessee and TETCO. Prior to construction of the Hunter=20
Pipeline,
TOG faced separate bottlenecks on the Tennessee and TETCO systems during th=
e
winter heating season; the location and capacity of the Hunter Pipeline was
selected to avoid these bottlenecks.

   On June 3, 1991, Texas-Ohio suspended transportation service through the

transported gas in interstate commerce. n6 On October 19, 1993, the Commiss=
ion
approved a stipulation and consent agreement in which Texas-Ohio agreed to=
=20
pay a
$ 125,000 civil penalty and to implement a program to comply with the NGA a=
nd
NGPA. n7

   n6 Texas-Ohio received all the gas that flowed through the Hunter Pipeli=

from Tennessee's interstate facility. Texas-Ohio then redelivered the gas t=
o
TETCO's interstate facility.

   n7 Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 65 FERC 61,069 (1993).Proposal

   Texas-Ohio requests authorization to operate its facilities in interstat=
e
[*6]  commerce and perform open-access transportation service. Texas-Ohio
proposes to charge firm shippers a transportation rate consisting of a
reservation charge of $ 1.4813 per MMBtu and a commodity charge of $ 0.0103=
=20
per
MMBtu.

   Interruptible shippers would pay a transportation rate consisting of a
commodity charge of $ 0.059 per MMBtu. n8n8 The proposed initial rates are =
the
same as those which Texas-Ohio was authorized to charge during the=20
effectiveness
of the temporary certificate. Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 58 FERC 61,025 at
61,059 (1992).


   Texas-Ohio states that operation of the Hunter Pipeline will permit=20
shippers
to avoid bottlenecks on the systems of Tennessee and TETCO. TETCO's bottlen=
eck
is located at a point near the Kentucky-Tennessee border. Due to this
constraint, TETCO has historically curtailed the interruptible transportati=
on=20
of
natural gas from receipt points located south of the Kentucky- Tennessee=20
border
that is destined for delivery to points north during the winter heating=20
season.
During the past three winter seasons, TETCO has curtailed interruptible
transportation for gas originating upstream of its Mt. Pleasant compressor
station [*7]  in Tennessee that is scheduled for delivery downstream to Zon=
es=20
C
and D.

   The bottleneck on Tennessee's system occurs in Mercer County, Pennsylvan=
ia.
As a result, gas produced and transported from receipt points south of Merc=
er
County cannot be transported to points north of Mercer County during certai=
n
periods of the year. During the past four winter seasons, Tennessee has
curtailed gas moving on an interruptible basis from points upstream of=20
stations
219, 237, and 313 to locations downstream of those stations.

   Texas-Ohio's facilities are positioned to avoid both bottlenecks. In thi=
s
regard, Tennessee typically has interruptible transportation capacity for
deliveries to Texas- Ohio's facilities, but has bottlenecks downstream of i=
ts
interconnection with Texas-Ohio. Conversely, TETCO has a bottleneck upstrea=
m=20
of
Texas-Ohio's facilities, but has capacity for the movement of interruptible
transportation volumes downstream of its Mt. Pleasant compressor station. A=
s
such, Texas-Ohio's facilities can be utilized to alleviate bottlenecks on t=

Discussion

   The Commission finds that by utilizing the Hunter [*8]  Pipeline shipper=
s
located upstream of the TETCO bottleneck can utilize Tennessee's system to=
=20
move
gas to Texas-Ohio for redelivery to TETCO and continued transportation
downstream. Shippers upstream of Tennessee's bottleneck, but downstream of
Texas-Ohio's facilities, can, by displacement, utilize Texas-Ohio's system =
to
access the TETCO system for continued transportation downstream. This
arrangement will avoid both the upstream and downstream bottlenecks and all=
ow
continued delivery of gas to various northeast markets located off both the
TETCO and Tennessee systems. We find that the public convenience and necess=
ity
requires issuance of a certificate pursuant to Part 157, subpart A,=20
authorizing
operation of Texas-Ohio's Hunter Pipeline.

   The Commission also finds that Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff generally
complies with the requirements for a Part 284 blanket transportation
certificate. Accordingly, we will grant Texas- Ohio's application for a Par=
t=20
284
blanket transportation certificate, subject to the conditions set forth her=
ein
to ensure Texas-Ohio's full compliance with the conditions of Order Nos. 63=
6,
497, and 566. Texas-Ohio's Part 284 blanket certificate will become effecti=
ve
[*9]  upon Texas-Ohio's full compliance with these conditions.


I. Rates

   Texas-Ohio proposes to charge the initial rates that were approved in th=
e
temporary certificate. Under this proposal, firm shippers would pay a
transportation rate consisting of a reservation charge of $ 1.4813 per MMBt=
u=20
and
a commodity charge of $ 0.0103 per MMBtu. Interruptible shippers would pay =
a
transportation rate consisting of a commodity charge of $ 0.059 per MMBtu. =
The
proposed rates are based on the modified fixed variable rate design (MFV), =
100
percent equity capitalization, a 15 percent return on equity, and a 10 perc=
ent
depreciation. The reservation and usage charges are based on 100 percent of=
=20
the
system design capacity.

A. Rate Design

   Order No. 636 requires pipelines to use the straight fixed variable (SFV=
)
rate design methodology. n9 Texas-Ohio has not provided any evidence which=
=20
would
support an exception to this requirement. Accordingly, we find that Texas-O=
hio
should be required to use the SFV rate design methodology. Additionally, si=
nce
Texas-Ohio's cost of service does not include any variable costs, we will
require it to use $ 0.0000 as the minimum FTS usage and ITS rates. n10

   n9 See 18 C.F.R. 284.7(d).

   n10 See Gateway Pipeline Co., 55 FERC 61,488 (1991). [*10]  B.=20
Capitalization
and Rate of Return

   Texas-Ohio proposes a capitalization consisting of 100 percent equity. W=
e
find that it is appropriate to use a hypothetical capital structure consist=
ing
of 57 percent debt and 43 percent equity; this structure is based on the 43=
.18
percent average equity ratio held by a group of seven major investor- owned
interstate pipelines at the end of 1993.
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20

                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *10


   We have generally used recent rates for Baa-rated public utility bonds t=
o=20
set
the debt costs on similar projects since Baa is the prevailing rating for
pipeline bonds. The rate for Baa utility bonds averaged 8.40 percent for th=
e=20
six
months ending July 31, 1994, with a one month average of 8.80 percent for J=
uly
1994. We find it appropriate to utilize a cost of debt of 8.50 percent.

   Texas-Ohio's proposed 15 percent rate of return on equity is excessive
considering the prevailing cost of capital. We find acceptable a rate of=20
return
derived from a range of returns based upon an analysis of recent interest=
=20
rates
and a discounted cash flow (DCF) study. The lower end of the range is=20
determined
by the prevailing Baa rating for public utility bonds; as discussed above, =
we
will use a figure of 8.50 percent for [*11]  the most recent six months. Si=
nce
equity is riskier than debt, 100 basis points should be added to the bond=
=20
rate,
thus bringing the lower end of the range to 9.50 percent.

   The upper end of the range is determined by a DCF analysis of a proxy gr=
oup
of seven publicly held natural gas transmission companies. n11 This proxy=
=20
group
is used because the DCF methodology requires market price data as an input =
in
the estimation of investor-expected equity returns. The DCF analysis for th=
e
proxy group results in a range of equity returns of 10.77 percent to 13.41
percent, with a median return of 12.19 percent.

   n11 Coastal Corporation, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Enron Corporation,
Panhandle Eastern, Sonat Inc., Transco Energy, and Williams Companies, Inc.

   This analysis uses dividend yields and forecasts of long- term growth ra=
tes
as follows. For the first five years, the Institutional Brokerage Estimate
System (IBES) estimates of five year growth in earnings per share was used.=
=20
For
longer-term growth (for the years 2000-2010), estimates taken from DRI/McGr=
aw
Hill (Energy Review, Spring-Summer 1994) for growth in the natural gas=20
industry
were used. A growth rate for each company in the [*12]  proxy group was
determined by averaging the two growth rates. Combining the bottom and top
figures establishes a range of 9.50 percent to 13.41 percent. The midpoint =
of
this range is approximately 11.50 percent.

   The Hunter Pipeline went into initial operation in 1990 and faces no
construction risk. Accordingly, we find that the company's risk is no highe=
r
than that of the average pipeline. Therefore, we will require a rate of ret=
urn
on equity of 11.5 percent, which is equal to the midpoint of the range of
reasonableness.

C. Depreciation

   Texas-Ohio proposes a book depreciation rate of 10 percent calculated on=
=20
the
straight-line method which supports an economic life of 10 years. We believ=
e
that the economic life of the Hunter Pipeline will depend upon gas reserves
connected to the Tennessee system and the future demand for natural gas
downstream of those facilities. We are confident that market demand and
operation of Tennessee and TETCO to service downstream markets in the=20
Northeast
States will continue for the next 25 years. We also believe that the Hunter
Pipeline will operate on a permanent basis and play an important role in th=
e
delivery of gas, especially during high demand [*13]  periods. Based on the=
se
factors, we find that an economic life of 25 years should be used to=20
calculate a
depreciation rate of four percent for the Hunter Pipeline facilities.
=0F,                                                                       =

D. Conclusion

   We will require Texas-Ohio to modify its rates as follows. For=20
interruptible
service, the minimum rate shall be $ 0.0000; the maximum rate shall be $=20
0.0518.
For firm service, the minimum reservation charge shall be $ 0.0000; the=20
maximum
reservation charge shall be $ 1.5749. The usage charge for firm service sha=
ll=20
be
$ 0.0000. n12 The rates approved herein are initial rates under NGA section=
 7;
their approval does not constitute approval of any underlying rate=20
methodology,
principle, or concept to be used in any general rate change filed pursuant =
to
NGA section 4. These initial rates will remain in effect until such time as
Texas-Ohio files an NGA section 4 general rate proceeding. At that time, an=
y
party or the Commission staff may propose new rates based on different
methodologies, principles or concepts.

   n12 All rates are expressed per MMBtu.

   II. Pro Forma Tariff

Texas-Ohio has applied for a blanket transportation certificate under secti=
on
284.221 of the Commission's regulations. It  [*14]  proposes to provide bot=
h
firm and interruptible transportation service. To commence service under a
blanket certificate, Texas-Ohio must file and place into effect rates, term=
s,
and conditions that are consistent with Part 284 of the regulations.=20
Texas-Ohio
has not made a tariff filing in this proceeding; it has, however, filed pro
forma tariff sheets which indicate the form its tariff will take. Generally=
,=20
the
pro forma tariff conforms to the Commission's requirements. As discussed=20
below,
however, certain provisions are either inconsistent with the Commission's
policies or are not adequately justified. Certain specific changes that we=
=20
will
require to be made to Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff are set forth in an=20
appendix
to this order.

A. Order No. 636

   Review of Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff indicates a number of changes th=
at
must be implemented to satisfy the requirements of Order No. 636. To implem=
ent
those changes, Texas-Ohio must make a tariff filing within 45 days of the d=
ate
of the issuance of this order. Also, Texas-Ohio is reminded that while cert=
ain
provisions of Order No. 636 may not apply at this time, future changes in i=
ts
operations may require tariff revisions to satisfy [*15]  the requirements =
of
that Order.

1. Equality of Service/Open Season

   Pipelines that offer open-access transportation service must provide tho=
se
services on a basis that is equal in quality for all gas suppliers, whether=
=20
the
gas is purchased from the pipeline or from another seller. Section=20
284.14(b)(iv)
of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. 284.14(b)(iv), requires a=20
pipeline's
tariff to reflect the principle of equality of service for all gas transpor=
ted
under each rate schedule.

   Texas-Ohio performs only unbundled transportation service; it does not
provide pipeline sales service. Texas-Ohio does, however, provide=20
transportation
service for its affiliated marketers, TOG and Texas-Ohio West, Inc. Origina=
l
Sheet No. 6, section 3.2, of Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff provides that
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 7
                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *15

customers with an already executed firm transportation contract for service=
 on
the Hunter Pipeline as of the effective date of the tariff shall have a=20
priority
over customers executing a service agreement at a later date. Service is
otherwise offered on a first-come, first-served basis. We find that this
provision gives preferential treatment to selected customers. It is unduly
discriminatory and must be [*16]  removed from the tariff. Further, we find=
=20
that
Texas-Ohio has never held an open-season or otherwise provided for the
non-discriminatory allocation of system capacity prior to initiating servic=
e.
Accordingly, we hold that Texas-Ohio must implement an open season within 3=
0
days of the date of issuance of an order in this proceeding to ensure non-
discriminatory allocation of system capacity.

2. Pregranted Abandonment and Right of First Refusal

   Section 284.221(d) of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. 284.221(d)=
,
authorizes pregranted abandonment of interruptible and short-term firm
transportation at the end of the contract. A short-term contract is one wit=
h a
term of less than one year. For long-term transportation with a term of mor=
e
than a year, section 284.14(b)(1)(xiii) requires the pipeline to establish=
=20
right
of first refusal procedures for use upon expiration of the long-term contra=
ct.
Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff does not comply with these requirements; it i=
s
directed to amend its tariff accordingly.

3. Capacity Release and Electronic Bulletin Board

   Section 284.243 of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. 284.243,=20
requires
interstate pipelines offering firm transportation [*17]  to establish a=20
capacity
release mechanism that allows firm shippers to release all or part of their=
=20
firm
transportation capacity rights to any person who wants to obtain that capac=
ity
by contracting with the pipeline. The release may be temporary, permanent, =
or
subject to conditions (i.e., on an interruptible basis). The pipeline must
allocate released capacity to the person offering the highest rate (not ove=
r=20
the
maximum rate) and offering to meet any other terms and conditions of the
release.

   Order No. 636 requires pipelines to provide timely and equal access to a=
ny
and all information necessary for buyers and sellers to arrange gas sales a=
nd
capacity release, including information regarding the availability of capac=
ity
at receipt and delivery points, and whether capacity is available from the
pipeline directly or through capacity releasing. This information must be=
=20
posted
on an electronic bulletin board (EBB).

   Texas-Ohio's proposed tariff lacks these provisions. It must amend its p=
ro
forma tariff to provide a capacity release mechanism and establish an EBB.

4. Upstream Capacity

Section 284.242 of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. 284.242, provide=
s
that an interstate [*18]  pipeline that offers transportation service on a=
=20
firm
basis under subparts B or G of Part 284 must offer, without undue
discrimination, to assign to its firm shippers its firm transportation=20
capacity,
including contract storage, on all upstream pipelines. Texas-Ohio does not
appear to hold any upstream capacity. In the tariff filing it is required t=
o
make to comply with the requirements of Order No. 636, Texas-Ohio should st=
ate
whether it holds any capacity on upstream pipelines. If it does, Texas-Ohio=
=20
must
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 8
                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *18

revise its tariff to comply with Order No. 636.

5. Transition Costs

   Texas-Ohio's filing predates Order No. 636 and consequently makes no=20
comment
regarding incurrence of transition costs. Accordingly, we will not make a
determination at this time with respect to Texas-Ohio's level of transition
costs. III. Docket No. MT94-2-000 Pursuant to our order of December 23, 199=
3,
Texas-Ohio filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. MT94-2-000 to comply w=
ith
the requirements of section 250.16(b), 18 C.F.R. 250.16(b). n13 With the
exception of the items discussed below, we find that Texas-Ohio's filing
complies with those requirements. n14

   n13 Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 65 FERC 61,387 (1993). Section 250.16 of =
the
Commission's regulations requires interstate natural gas pipelines that
transport natural gas for others pursuant to subparts B, G, H, or K of Part=
=20
284,
and that are affiliated in any way with a natural gas marketing or brokerin=
g
entity, to file certain information relevant to that relationship.

   n14 On June 17, 1994, Order No. 566 modified section 250.16(b) effective
August 1, 1994 by, among other things, eliminating the requirement that
pipelines (1) receive certain information from shippers in requests for
transportation service, (2) log and post on the EBB complaints made by=20
shippers,
and (3) include procedures to communicate pricing and capacity information.
 [*19]

   The tariff sheets filed by Texas-Ohio do not set forth the information
required to be filed in a transportation request. Texas-Ohio contends that=
=20
since
it is operating under a temporary certificate and is prohibited from provid=
ing
transportation service to new customers pending further action on its
application, that information is not applicable.

   While Order No. 566 eliminated certain information previously required t=
o=20
be
provided in the transportation request form, it still requires pipelines to
maintain a log of data used to allocate capacity. Texas-Ohio must comply wi=
th
this provision and file a transportation request form as specified.

   Texas-Ohio can address this deficiency by either revising existing tarif=
f
provisions, including its FTS and ITS request form, or by incorporating the
changes into Section 16 (Order No. 497 Compliance Procedures) of its propos=
ed
tariff. Texas-Ohio must make a compliance filing within 45 days of the=20
issuance
of this order incorporating all information required by Order Nos. 497 and=
=20
566.
Additionally, since the tariff sheets Texas-Ohio filed in Docket No.=20
MT94-2-000
are not pro forma, Texas-Ohio should filed corrected tariff sheets in a for=
m
[*20]  acceptable to become effective upon issuance of an order in this
proceeding.

IV.Environmental Matters

   On August 22, 1990, Texas-Ohio notified the Commission that it intended =
to
commence construction of the Hunter Pipeline and that the facilities would =
be
used for the transportation of natural gas under NGPA section 311(a)(2). Th=
is
notice provided the environmental information required by section 157.206(d=
)=20
of
the Commission's regulations.

=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 9
                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *20

   To ensure that operation of the Hunter Pipeline compressors complies wit=
h=20
the
noise requirements of section 157.206(d)(5), Texas-Ohio must perform a
post-construction sound survey of the compressor station. This survey must =
be
performed not later than 30 days after the date of issuance of this order. =
n15
Texas-Ohio's application for a Part 157, subpart A certificate to operate t=
he
Hunter Pipeline and a Part 284, subpart G blanket transportation certificat=
e
relies solely on the use of existing facilities; no additional construction
authorization is requested or granted. Accordingly, subject to Texas-Ohio's
compliance with section 157.206(d)(5), we conclude that approval of the=20
instant
application is not a major Federal action significantly affecting [*21]  th=
e
quality of the human environment.

   n15 Section 157.206(d)(5) provides that the noise attributable to any
compressor facility shall not exceed a day-night sound level of 55 dB(A) at=
=20
any
existing noise-sensitive areas.V. IESCO's Protest

   In its protest and request for an evidentiary hearing, IESCO charges tha=
t
Texas-Ohio's jurisdictional status must be determined as a precondition to =
the
issuance of a certificate.

   IESCO states that if Texas-Ohio was not a interstate pipeline for the=20
period
from November 1990 through June 3, 1991, it could not legally offer NGPA=20
section
311(a)(2) service and competing sellers of gas (such as IESCO) could have b=
een
unfairly deprived of their markets.

   The Commission's January 15, 1992 order issuing Texas-Ohio a temporary
certificate to operate the Hunter Pipeline laid to rest concerns regarding
Texas-Ohio's jurisdictional status. Further, Texas-Ohio agreed in the=20
settlement
approved in the Commission's October 18, 1993, order to comply with the NGA=
,
NGPA, and the Commission's regulations. This order issues Texas-Ohio a case=
-
specific certificate pursuant to subpart A of Part 157 and a blanket
transportation certificate pursuant to subpart G of [*22]  Part 284. No
questions remain as to the jurisdictional status of Texas-Ohio.

   IESCO then complains that Texas-Ohio should have held an open-season dur=
ing
which prospective shippers would have an opportunity to obtain services on =
the
Hunter Pipeline. As discussed above, the Commission has investigated
Texas-Ohio's operation and determined, among other things, that Texas-Ohio
notified only its marketing affiliate and the marketing affiliate's custome=
rs=20
of
the availability of capacity prior to construction of the Hunter Pipeline. =
The
Commission's policies require Texas-Ohio to use a non-discriminatory method=
 of
selecting customers for both firm and interruptible transportation service=
=20
when
operating under Part 284. n16 As noted above, we are holding that Texas-Ohi=
o
must hold an open season prior to commencing service under its Part 284=20
blanket
certificate. This approach will ensure that prior notice of firm capacity i=
s
made available to all interested parties on a contemporaneous basis and in =
a
non-discriminatory manner. n17

   n16 18 C.F.R. 284.8(b) and 284.9(b).

   n17 See, e.g., Pacific Gas Transmission Co., 54 FERC 61.035 at 61,154=20
(1991);
ANR Storage Co., 51 FERC 61,114 at 61.304 (1990). [*23]

   IESCO next asserts that Texas-Ohio's proposed tariff does not assure tha=
t
nondiscriminatory service will be provided. We disagree. Acceptance by
=0F,                                                                       =

Texas-Ohio of the blanket transportation certificate authorized by this ord=
er,
and as conditioned herein, will subject Texas-Ohio to the full range of the
Commission's requirements, including those prohibiting discriminatory=20
practices.

   IESCO states that Texas-Ohio must be required to comply with the provisi=
ons
of the Affiliated Marketer Rule. As we noted in the order issuing a tempora=
ry
certificate, Order Nos. 497 and 497-A apply to all interstate pipelines wit=
h
affiliated marketers. Upon acceptance of the temporary certificate Texas- O=
hio
became subject to the conditions of those orders. n18 Texas-Ohio's standard=
s=20
of
conduct implementing Order No. 497, filed in Docket No. MG93-5-000, have be=
en
accepted by the Commission. n19 When Texas-Ohio complies with this order's
directions, Texas-Ohio will be in full compliance with Order No. 497.

ne,
Inc., 67 FERC 61,149 (1994). [*24]

   IESCO asserts that Texas-Ohio's proposed rates have not been shown to be
required by the present or future public convenience and necessity. It is
particularly concerned with the fact that Texas-Ohio seeks to depreciate it=
s
facilities over a ten-year period. As discussed above, we agree that
Texas-Ohio's proposed rates and ten-year depreciation period are=20
inappropriate,
and we have required adjustments to those figures as appropriate.

   IESCO also raises in its protest issues relating to Texas- Ohio's=20
application
for a temporary certificate. Those issues were addressed in our January 15,=

order issuing a temporary certificate. Issues raised by IESCO on rehearing =
of
that order are discussed below.

   In view of our disposition of the issues raised by IESCO, we find that=

there
are no disputed material issues of fact and, therefore, no need for an
evidentiary trial-type hearing. n20

for
Rehearing

   On February 14, 1992, IESCO filed a request for rehearing of the=20
Commission's
January 15, 1992 order issuing Texas-Ohio a temporary certificate. IESCO
contends first that issuance of the temporary [*25]  certificate to Texas-O=
hio
was unlawful on three grounds: (1) the Commission acted beyond its statutor=
y
authority because it improperly determined that an emergency existed; (2) e=
ven
if an emergency existed, the Commission failed to make adequate findings
supported by substantial evidence; and (3) the Commission failed to resolve
jurisdictional and tariff issues in connection with issuance of the tempora=
ry
certificate.

   NGA section 7(c)(1)(B) provides that ""the Commission may issue a tempora=
ry
certificate in cases of emergency, to assure maintenance of adequate servic=
e=20
or
to serve particular customers without notice or hearing, pending the
determination of an application for a [permanent] certificate . . . ."" The=

order
issuing a temporary certificate expressly found that an emergency exists=20
within
the meaning of section 7(c)(1)(B) of the Natural Gas Act and section 157.17=
 of
the Commission's regulations, and that the public convenience and necessity

operation of the Hunter Pipeline in order to continue service to existing
customers who had been relying on that service. n21 In support thereof, the
order referenced [*26]  the fact that: (1) Raritan River Steel Company, the
largest employer in Perth Amboy, New Jersey would be forced to purchase gas=
=20
at a
higher price and might have to close its plant with disastrous impacts on t=
he
community; and (2) a number of entities, including the Philadelphia Housing
Authority, the Dartmouth Finishing Corporation, and various schools indicat=
ed
that they are operating under strained budgets and that the inability to
transport gas on Texas-Ohio would result in severe fiscal restraints.

   n21 Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 58 FERC 61,025 at 61,059 (1992).

   Under these circumstances, we believe that an emergency situation was sh=
own
to exist within the standard established by NGA section 7 and that this
conclusion is appropriately supported by the evidence relied upon in the=20
order.
n22

   n22 See generally, Penn-York Energy Corp., 37 FERC 61,109 (1986);
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., 34 FERC 61,402 (1986).

   With regard to its assertion that the Commission failed to resolve certa=
in
jurisdictional and tariff issues prior to the issuance of the temporary
certificate, IESCO complains that:  [*27]  (i) the Commission issued a=20
temporary
certificate without making a finding that Texas-Ohio is a ""natural gas=20
company""
subject to the Commission's NGA jurisdiction; (ii) the failure to resolve t=
he
jurisdictional issue leaves unresolved the question of whether a certificat=
e=20
of
public convenience and necessity is needed for the construction of the Hunt=
er
Pipeline; and (iii) the Commission has left unresolved the question of whet=
her
an open-season is required to assure non-discriminatory access to Texas-Ohi=
o's
facility, thus precluding shippers who were denied service from any=20
opportunity
to obtain service during the period that the temporary certificate is in=20
effect.

   IESCO's arguments misapprehend the function of a temporary certificate. =
By
its very nature, issuance of a temporary certificate precedes decisions on
matters related to issuance of the permanent certificate. The issues raised=
 by
IESCO are appropriate for decision in connection with the issuance of a
permanent certificate and we have addressed them above. n23

   n23 We in fact noted in the January 15, 1992 order that the issues raise=
d=20
by
IESCO relating to the jurisdictional status of Texas-Ohio and the provision=
 of
service on a nondiscriminatory basis would be resolved upon consideration o=
f=20
the
application for a permanent certificate. We stressed at that time that ""the
grant of a temporary certificate is made to allow the resumption of service=
 by
specific customers previously utilizing Texas-Ohio's facilities to prevent
hardship."" Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 58 FERC 61,025 at 61,060 (1992). [*28=
]

   IESCO also asserts that the Commission improperly refused to order an
evidentiary hearing before issuing the temporary certificate. IESCO alleges=
=20
that
efforts in Docket No. PR91-5-000 to determine the original and ultimate
destination of gas transported by Texas-Ohio were unsuccessful. It also sta=
tes
that the proceedings in Docket No. PR91-5-000 and the instant docket have b=
een
plagued by uncertainty over the identity of Texas- Ohio's customers and the
nature of the services rendered.

   We disagree that an evidentiary hearing was required prior to the issuan=
ce=20

=0F,                                                                       =

where

immaterial to the decision to issue a temporary certificate to allow the

that the Commission failed to attach conditions needed to prevent abuse of =
the
temporary [*29]  certificate. IESCO states that the temporary certificate=
=20
should
have been expressly limited to serving customers previously served through =
the
Hunter Pipeline and that it should have included a condition for potential
refunds.

   n24 Arkla Gathering Service Co., 67 FERC 61,257 (1994).

certificate is not a blanket authorization, but is limited to only those

APPENDIX:

   APPENDIX

   Pro Forma Tariff Analysis: Specific Comments

1. Rate Schedules FTS and/or ITS

   Section 1 - Availability

In this section, Texas-Ohio reserves the right, in its sole judgement=20
(exercised
on a reasonable [*32]  and non-discriminatory basis) to decline service=20
whenever
it would be contrary to good operational practices or detrimental to other
customers. Texas- Ohio should revise this section to set out the specific
criteria or detrimental actions that would trigger this clause.

   Section 1.(iii) of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS requires shippers to provi=
de
Texas-Ohio with ""acceptable"" evidence of, among other things, gas supply,
market, and other transportation services. The term ""acceptable"" is vague a=
nd
subject to unduly discriminatory interpretation. Texas-Ohio must set forth
specifically the evidence required to be ""acceptable"".

   Section 2- Applicability and Character of Service

Section 2.4 of Rate Schedule ITS states that transportation will be ""subjec=
t=20
to
curtailment or interruption as deemed necessary in Texas-Ohio's discretion.=
""=20
The
provision is vague and could result in unduly discriminatory application of
curtailment procedures. Texas-Ohio must modify the provision to detail the
specific operational characteristics and criteria used to determine the
conditions and need for curtailment.

   Section 3 - Priority and Interruption of Transportation Service

=0F,                                                                       =

PAGE 14
                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *33

Section 3.2 of Rate Schedule  [*33]  FTS provides for firm service on a fir=
st
come, first served basis. However, Texas-Ohio retains a priority for custom=
ers
with existing FTS agreements. This provision is unduly discriminatory and m=
ust
be removed from the tariff.

   Section 3.4 of Rate Schedule FTS provides that Texas-Ohio can curtail=20
service
due to reasons of force majeure ""or any other operational considerations to=
 be
reasonably determined by Texas- Ohio"". Texas-Ohio must set forth the specif=
ic
operational considerations it would rely upon in exercising this authority.

   In Section 3.5 of Rate Schedule FTS and Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule ITS=
,
Texas-Ohio proposes to suspend service if a shipper's account is unpaid for=
 30
days. Texas-Ohio can suspend service without prior Commission approval if a
customer fails to pay a billed amount within 30 days of the due date, but o=
nly
where 10 days notice is given and the shipper neither pays the bill nor=20
provides
guarantee of payment. Texas-Ohio must modify these provisions to provide fo=
r a
10 day notice period.

   Section 4 - Requests for Transportation

Section 4.1 of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS states that a shipper must comple=
te=20
a
FTS or ITS Request Form; however, no request  [*34]  form is included.
Texas-Ohio must establish a request form as part of its tariff. That form m=
ust
comply with the requirements of Order No. 497 as set forth in section=20
250.16(b)
of the Commission's regulations.

   Section 5 - Operating Conditions

Section 5.1 of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS requires shippers to provide
Texas-Ohio with estimates of gas to be transported and such other operating=
=20
data
as Texas-Ohio may require. This section should be amended to specify what=
=20
other
operating data may be required of shippers.

   Section 5.4 of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS specifies that Texas-Ohio will=
=20
not
provide service on any day for which all necessary upstream and downstream
arrangements cannot be confirmed. This clause should be amended to state th=
at
any action will be taken on a non-discriminatory basis.

   Section 6 - Rates

Section 6.2 of Rate Schedule FTS defines the monthly reservation and commod=
ity
(usage) charge. Texas-Ohio should insert the word ""maximum"" in the second
sentence prior to ""monthly commodity charge"" and ""unit commodity rate(s)"".

   Section 9 - Waivers

Section 9 of Rate Schedule FTS provides that Texas-Ohio may waive any right=
s
hereunder or any obligations of a customer on [*35]  a basis which is not=
=20
unduly
discriminatory.  This language creates the impression that Texas-Ohio retai=
ns
the discretion to waive default by the shipper of any provision in the tari=
ff.
This would give Texas-Ohio excessive latitude in operating under its tariff=
=20
and
provide an opportunity for undue discrimination among shippers. Waiver
provisions are permissible, but they must serve a functional purpose and=20
operate
under a specific and clearly defined set of circumstances. Texas-Ohio must
specify the criteria it will use in determining whether to waive a particul=
ar
=0F,                                                                       =

provision.

   2. General Terms and Conditions

Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff contains no scheduling or imbalance penalties=
.
Pipelines are permitted, but not required, to impose penalties to maintain
control of their system. If scheduling or imbalances become a problem in th=
e
future, Texas- Ohio can make a tariff filing to propose appropriate penalti=
es.

   Section 2 - Transporter Receipt Point(s)

   Section 2.2 provides that Texas-Ohio's obligation to receive and deliver=
=20
gas
shall never exceed the total daily volume Shipper is able and willing to
receive. Texas-Ohio must remove the words ""and willing"" from this provision=
.=20
The
phrase [*36]  is vague and could lead to discriminatory activities.

   Section 5 - Nominations and Balancing Deliveries

Section 5.1 provides that a shipper will inform Texas-Ohio daily, ""or on so=
me
other basis as Transporter may reasonably require pursuant to such other
procedures as may be established and published by Transporter from time to=
=20
time
. . . ."" of the daily gas quantity. The phrase is vague and should be repla=
ced
with language specifying what other basis for notification is required (e.g=
.,
phone, fax, or telecopy).

   Section 5.2 requires shippers to give Texas-Ohio notice 24 hours in adva=
nce
""or as Transporter may designate from time to time"" of any change in the da=
ily
quantity. Texas-Ohio should specify what alternative time frame would meet =
its
requirements or delete this phrase.

I talked with PSEG this afternoon.  They plan to forward us their comments on 
the draft SPA sometime tomorrow.  I have reviewed their due diligence 
questions and plan to address most of them in a phone call with PSEG tomorrow.

I instructed PSEG to forward me a copy of their proposed side letter 
addressing a $300K non-refundable deposit and 30 day exclusivity period.  I 
told them that we would look at it and let them know if we viewed it as a 
viable option.  They plan to forward it to us tomorrow along with their legal 
comments on the draft SPA.

I will keep you informed.

"The weekend of Dec 15, 16, 17.  Stinson Beach.  Glorious place on the beach.  
Professional blue grass band.  Catered food.  Fun people (even Tom, Karen, 
David, Starr and Nina).   For Prentice's 30th birthday.  And it will just 
suck if you're not there.  Huge hugs, very wet kisses."
"As an introduction:  The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out 
the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not 
all of the products it wants to trade).

When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved 
to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the 
European products, including specifically European physical power products 
(which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).

Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to 
check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the 
products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).

What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with 
respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap 
Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, 
which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone 
up for unless we really mean it.

So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian 
based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going 
to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down 
for European physical power.

Subject: Turbine contract

I have taken what I believe this is the most recent form of the GE turbine 
contract, changed to reflect the difference in purchaser, and filled in some 
of the blanks.  I have compared it against the Delta redline that Rick sent 
me this afternoon, after having accepted Delta's proposed changes for the 
purpose of running the comparison.   The notes included are placeholders 
since I wasn't clear if these items will change with the equipment swap.

Sara and Donna:

I apologize for waiting two months to pick a date in order to consume
some of Sara's excess wine, but I think I found a good place to meet.
There is a restaurant named La Vista at 1936 Fountain View, just North
of the Rice Epicurean. It should be real close to Donna, and they let
you bring your own bottle(s) of wine. If Sara brings the wine, then I
could spring for the dinner and Donna could bring the flowers.

I am tied up next Thursday and Friday, and I know that Sara has the
Enron Law Conference in San Antonio the following Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday. Hopefully, there is a window in there when we can all get
together.

"For Dec, we were taking 4679 day from the Egan parking into TGT.  Effective 
12/16/2000, we moved the remaining balance to Jan 2001.  I made the following 
adjustments to deal 473190, 
 took daily withdrawal volumes to 0 effective 12/16 - 12/31
 extended the deal to Jan 2001
 changed 1/1/2001 to 2444
 changed 1/2/2001 - 1/31/2001 to 2414

This might be a little confusing because we also have withdrawals of about 
1500 day in Jan.

Also, Egan is showing a different balance than what I have.

I show we should have a total balance of 132,247 (4679 x (31-13)  plus  48025 
)  at the end of gas day 12/13/2000.  Egan is showing a balance of 134,302.  
This just means that we parked more gas than I thought or we cut back on some 
of our withdrawals on the 1st through the 13th.  No big deal, I just want to 
make sure we don't leave any gas in parking."

Today's focus: McVeigh video really a virus

By Jason Meserve (write me at jmeserve@nww.com)

You knew someone would take advantage of the recent execution
of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to spread a virus.
According to a number of computer security types, a purported
video of the McVeigh execution circulating the 'Net is actually
a virus that drops the SubSeven backdoor onto infected systems.

For those who don't know, SubSeven can be used to take over
control of the infected machine and be used in distributed
denial-of-service attacks. The good news is that most updated
antivirus scanners already detect this virus, so if your
systems are up to date, you should be safe.

For more on this, check out this wire story posted on
DigitalMass.com:
http://digitalmass.boston.com/news/2001/06/14/mcveigh_virus.html


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* SQL security hole lets attackers take over

A security flaw in Microsoft's SQL Server 7.0 and SQL Server
2000 Gold can allow an attacker to take control of a targeted
server, the company said in a security bulletin late Tuesday
night. Microsoft issued a patch for the flaw at the same time
it released the bulletin.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0613sqlhole.html
IDG News Service, 06/13/01

For a patch and more information from Microsoft:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-032.asp


* Microsoft has third go at Exchange hole

Microsoft has issued a third version of a patch intended to
plug a security hole that could allow hackers access to
mailboxes on Exchange Server Versions 5.5 and 2000. The second
patch contained outdated files, Microsoft said in an updated
security bulletin issued Wednesday.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0614exchangehole.html
IDG News Service, 06/14/01

For a third try at getting the correct patch, click to:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-030.asp


* HP warns of potential DoS vulnerability in kmmodreg

Hewlett-Packard is warning its HP-UX operating system users of
a potential denial-of-service vulnerability in the kmmodreg
command, which is executed each time the system is booted. The
problem with the package also could be used to increase
privileges on the affected system. HP-UX users can download a
patch for the kmmodreg problem by logging on to HP's IT
Resource Center at:
http://itrc.hp.com


* Xinetd patch released by Linux OS vendors

Many Linux vendors have released a patch for the xinetd package
that fixes a flaw in the way the application deals with TCP
WAIT commands. The problem prevents the linuxconf-web
application from working properly. Another flaw in the xinetd
package creates world-writeable files that can be used in a
symlink attack. Linux-Mandrake users can download the new patch
from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3

Red Hat users can get more information and links to patches
from:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-075.html

Immunix OS 7.0-beta and 7.0 users can get the appropriate patch
from:
http://download.immunix.org/ImmunixOS/7.0/updates/RPMS/xinetd-2.1.8.9pre15-2

_imnx.i386.rpm


* Linux-Mandrake patches tcpdump

Linux-Mandrake has issued a patch for its tcpdump package that
fixes a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The flaw could
be used in a remote attack on the tcpdump process. This patch
also fixes a previous vulnerability that could allow a remote
user to run arbitrary code on the affected system without root
privileges. The new patch can be downloaded from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3


* Linux-Mandrake fixes imap flaw

According to an alert from Linux-Mandrake, several flaws have
been found in the UW-IMAP package that could allow an
authenticated user to gain greater shell command access. This
is particularly problematic for e-mail systems that do not
normally provide shell access. Patches can be downloaded from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3


* Conectiva patches exim

A printf vulnerability exists in exim, a mail transfer utility.
The flaw in the code deals with the way exim check e-mail
headers without protecting against a printf format attack.
Conectiva users can download the appropriate patch from:
ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/SRPMS/exim-3.16-4U60_1cl.src.rpm
ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm
ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-doc-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm

ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-mon-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm



* Red Hat issues patch for ispell

According to an alert from Red Hat, the ispell program uses
mktemp() to open temporary files, which makes it vulnerable to
symlink attacks. For more information and to download a patch:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-074.html


* GnuPG patch available for Red Hat Linux users

GnuPG, an open source version of PGP, contains a number of
flaws that could leave a user's private key exposed. The
problem is a format string vulnerability in GnuPG's code. For
more information and links to the appropriate download:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-073.html


* Red Hat: LPRng fails to drop supplemental group membership

According to an alert from Red Hat, LPRng fails to drop
supplemental group membership at init time, though it does
properly setuid and setgid. The result is that LPRng, and its
children, maintain any supplemental groups that the process
starting LPRng had at the time it started LPRng. This is a
security risk. Download the appropriate patch from:

Red Hat Linux 7.0:
alpha:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/en/os/alpha/LPRng-3.7.4-23.alpha.rpm
i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/en/os/i386/LPRng-3.7.4-23.i386.rpm

Red Hat Linux 7.1:
i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.1/en/os/i386/LPRng-3.7.4-23.i386.rpm


* ScreamingMedia patches SiteWare vulnerability

A flaw in ScreamingMedia's SiteWare Web server could allow a
user to view all documents in the SiteWare Web hierarchy. A
similar problem could allow any file to be retrieved from the
system. More information and a patch can be found at:
http://www01.screamingmedia.com/en/security/sms1001.php


Today's round up of virus alerts:


* Simpsons worm hits Macs

When the Mac vs. PC wars start up, as they inevitably do, on
Usenet or Web message boards or just around the office, Mac
partisans always tout the dearth of viruses for their chosen
computer as one of the main benefits in adopting Apple's
operating system. And though, technically, there still may not
be very many viruses for the Mac, a new Mac e-mail worm has
recently been discovered and is making its way across iMacs and
Powerbooks everywhere.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0611simpsons.html
IDG News Service, 06/11/01


* Virus hoax warns people to delete AOL

Perhaps the greatest thrill for any prankster is to have his
hoax taken as truth. Just such a thing has happened to Ray
Owens, who runs a Web site called Joke A Day. Owens sent an e-
mail to the 342,000 of his subscribers on June 5 (after an
initial mailing on June 2 to another list) warning them of a
new virus, called AOL.EXE. Warning your customers of a virus
seems like a nice thing to do, except that AOL.EXE isn't a
virus at all; it's the AOL application that provides Internet
access to millions of people worldwide.
http://www.nwfusion.com/net.worker/news/2001/0611aolhoax.html
IDG News Service, 06/11/01

* WM97/Myna-AR - A Word macro virus with no malicious payload.
(Sophos)

* XM97/Laroux-OC - This Excel macro virus spreads by creating a
file called ""BINV.XLS"" in the XLSTART directory. (Sophos)

* WM97/Opey-AU - This Word macro virus removes the macros
section of the tools menu and disables the Visual Basic Editor.
It also displays five different messages on five different
dates. (Sophos)

* XM97/Barisada-Y - An Excel macro virus that spreads via a
file called ""KHM.XLS"" in the XLSTART directory. Unlike its
predecessors, this one does not contain pop-up messages.
(Sophos)

* VBS/Lovelet-CE - Yet another variant of the infamous
LoveLetter virus. This one comes with a subject line of ""News
Email Beta Run1.01"" and a file attachment called
""NEWSEMAIL.VBS."" (Sophos)


>From the interesting reading department:


* Hackers taunt EC with site defacement

Dutch hackers on Tuesday evening defaced SaferInternet.org, a
Web site sponsored by the European Commission that promotes a
safer Internet. Security at the site had been increased just
last week after other hackers raised a red flag about possible
vulnerabilities.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0613hackers.html
IDG News Service, 06/13/01


* Microsoft plugs seven Telnet security holes in Windows 2000

If the Telnet service included with Microsoft's Windows 2000
operating system has looked suspiciously like Swiss cheese
recently, that might be because it has seven security holes
that need patching. Microsoft has acknowledged the holes and
issued a patch late last week.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0611msplug.html
IDG News Service, 06/11/01


* When private peering arrangements go bad: Cable & Wireless
shuts out 14 ISPs, including PSINet

Cable & Wireless likely didn't make any new friends on the
Internet last week when it started enforcing its newly revised
peering policy, cutting off service to more than a dozen ISPs.

Well, the time has finally arrived............after purchasing some bean bag 
and inflatable 'Southpark' chairs, I'm officially ready for a party.  Won't 
you please come  over and share in a few cocktails.   This Saturday, March 31 
at 7:30,  1314 Utah St.  (corner of Truro and Utah, near Memorial Park)   I 
will have beverages and snacks, but as in the past, no jello shots or Busch 
beer.  (sorry Matt and Mike)

Most of you aren't aware of where I live, but parking could be a problem. 
(sorry, no valet)   In the 'hood', people tend to park wherever they can, 
this being along all the streets surrounding the house as well as the 
volleyball courts at Bubbas.  Park wherever you can.

Please see the attached map or go to Yahoo Maps for assistance.  It works 
well if you use 1380 Utah St.  (Don't ask why)    Please pass this on to 
others that I may have overlooked.  Call if you have any questions.

(Friday) about how the market will be fixed: 
FERC To Meet Nov 9 To Propose Remedies To Calif 
                    Pwr Mkt 
                    Friday, October 20, 2000 08:17 AM 
  
                    LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--In an unusual move, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory                     Commission said Thursday it will meet 
Nov. 1 to discuss remedies to California's                     troubled 
wholesale power market. 
                    Details of a probe into California's wholesale 
electricity market will also be released at                     the Nov. 1 
meeting. As reported, state and federal regulators launched the probe over    
                 the summer, saying the market wasn't workably competitive. 
                    FERC also said it expects to hold a public hearing Nov. 9 
to discuss possible                     solutions to California's power 
crisis. 
                    The place and time of both meetings haven't been decided 
yet. 
                    Regarding Thursday's announcement, FERC Commissioner Curt 
Hebert said ""rather                     than waiting for Nov. 1 to release 
the findings of our staff's investigation, I urge the                     
chairman to release the completed report now...it can only help heal the raw 
emotions                     rampant in the state of California."" 
                    FERC said it was rare that it would announce details of 
its procedures. The                     commission said its own rules don't 
allow it to normally announce its procedures. 
                    ""Because of the need for expeditious action to address 
the serious issues affecting                     California electric power 
markets and California consumers...the commission is taking                   
  the unusual step of announcing in advance the procedures it expects to 
follow over the                     coming weeks to move forward in these 
proceedings,"" the FERC order said. 
                    The commission said it will give a three-week deadline 
for parties to intervene and to                     comment on the possible 
solutions presented by the commission. 
                    FERC said it anticipates issuing an order by the end of 
the year ""adopting and                     directing remedies to promptly 
address to the extent possible the identified problems                     
adversely affecting competitive power markets in California."" 
                    If necessary, FERC said it would hold additional meetings 
to develop solutions ""to                     other identified problems."" 
                    California's wholesale power prices soared this past 
summer. Customers of San                     Diego Gas & Electric Co., a unit 
of Sempra Energy Corp. (SRE, news, msgs), paid                     
market-based rates for power, which resulted in triple-digit utility bills 
for its customers.                     The state's three investor-owned 
utilities also racked up billions of dollars in debt due                     
to high wholesale costs. 
                    SDG&E customers are currently paying a fixed rate for 
their power, while customers of                     the state's other two 
utilities are still bound by a rate-freeze. 
                    Generators have been accused of gouging customers and 
manipulating the market,                     although no evidence has been 
offered up yet. However, the FERC investigation may                     
address that.

Enron Turns Internal Credit-Risk Tool Into New Product
2001-04-04 17:19 (New York)



   By Christina Cheddar
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--With the number of corporate bankruptcies on the rise,
knowing the creditworthiness of one's customers is becoming more and more
important.
  For Enron Corp. (ENE), the world's largest energy trading company, keeping
track of credit risk has always been part of doing business. That became even
more true with the company's launch of EnronOnline, its Internet-based
commodities trading network.
  In order to deal with the accelerated volume and speed of transactions on
EnronOnline, the company developed a tool to help its own commercial traders
manage the credit risk.
  Early last year, Enron rolled out this tool, Enron Credit, on a limited
basis. Gradually, the company expanded its use and scope. Last month, the
company re-launched Enron Credit in its current format.
  Enron Credit tracks more than 10,000 companies, giving each a rating known 
as
the ""Enron cost of credit."" The rating is expressed as an interest rate.
  The Web site also provides news, a company's expected chance of bankruptcy
and other related information.
  While much of this information is free to registered users, Enron also has
turned the product into a new revenue stream.
  Users may download data into a spreadsheet and receive periodic updates for 
a
fee.
  The site also can sell a user a ""digital bankruptcy swap,"" which is a way to
hedge against credit exposure.
  The price of the swap is determined by a rating Enron's staff assigns to a
company and the amount of credit exposure a company needs to protect against.
  For a supplier, the main advantage of a swap is that if a customer is unable
to pay due to bankruptcy, the supplier will be paid immediately.
  According to Enron Europe President John Sherriff, the goal of Enron Credit
is to create a more efficient credit market by increasing trading liquidity.
  The tool is important because ""in just a short amount of time, a company's
credit can go from stellar to bad literally overnight.""
  At present, some analysts haven't factored in revenue from Enron Credit into
their earnings models. However, as the commodity markets Enron trades in
mature, it is possible the need for products such as Enron Credit could
increase.

"The JLM  case has settled for the full amont of the claim--app. $1.7 mm.
The KN case has tentatively settled for app. $19.4 mm. The settlement 
agreements have not been signed. "
"Sorry about that Edmund.  The forms have been moved out of the atty.fms bank 
into their own subdirectory called ""Swap Forms"" (look it up just like a 
person's named directory).   Let me know whether you can access that database 
from London.  We had London set up to review the atty.fms bank only, I don't 
know if you can access other subdirectories.

We have made some substantive revisions to the ISDA Schedule and Credit 
Support Annex, so you might want to take a look.  If you can't do a 
comparewrite from London, let me know and I'll email you the blacklined 
forms.  We've also made changes to the forms of guarantees.  They are now 
located in a document called Guaranty.doc in the Swap Forms/Current Forms 
directory.

Also, the ISDA definitions have been changed since you've been gone, you may 
already know that, but just in case...I thought I'd bring it up."

Several recent developments, and in the interest of economy (mine!), I am 
copying all of you, who will have varying interests in this.

First, as soon as the upper house of parliament passes legislation, Austria 
will have accelerated their market oppening, to 100% in power by 2001, 
October, and by 2002, October for gas.  Sadia, you will want to reflect this 
in what you are doing for Kyran/EES, and Kathryn, you will want to note this, 
if Investor Relations is updating this data for analysts.  Margaret, FYI to 
you, too.

Second, I note that this decision was reached after being supported by a 
studyby the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), saying 
liberalisation would bring down prices by 12-15%.  Paul H., suggest you have 
Viviana get a copy, and if in English, send copies to Margaret Carson.

Belgian cabinet has approved draft regulation lowering power threshold to 
20GWh p.a.   This goes to 10 GWh on 31 December 2002.  Sadia, I think this is 
again an acceleration, to be reflected in your updated numbers.  Margaret and 
Kathryn, also note.

Finally, Kyran, I see that EnergieNed has issued a study saying that there is 
""not a direct relationship between efficiency and deregulation"".  I may take 
issue with this, depending upon what the full text says.  Can you work with 
Teun/Sadia to obtain a copy, and, if not too lengthy, get it translated for 
my review (and presumably your's, too)?  thanks

Please do not hesitate to contact me should any of you have any questions.    
thanks  mcs

"thanks very much for the info.  certainly makes it interesting.  how's 
things?  

P.S. do you know that edison at the FERC hearing said that it hedged $30MM 
and made a whopping $415 MM!!!  Are they gouging San Diegans?  Are they 
""gaming"" the system?  Inquiring minds want to know.  You may want to check in 
with Smutney when Edison made the statement.  There may be nothing to it, but 
it might be interesting to check into.  Is Edison one of those ""profiteers"" 
who ought to give San Diegans a refund?

Dan Walters: 2% problems vex governor


(Published Sept. 14, 2000)
Two percent doesn't sound like much of anything, but California's economy is
just so big -- a trillion-plus dollars a year, measured by either output or
personal income -- that even a tiny share can mean many billions of dollars.
As it happens, Gov. Gray Davis finds himself in the middle of several
quasi-economic, quasi-political squabbles, each of which involves a couple
of percentage points of California's economy -- and the outcome of which may
affect his governorship.
One showdown occurred last week when the Air Resources Board, an arm of the
Davis administration, decided to stick with its policy of compelling the
auto industry to sharply increase sales of zero-emission cars. There are
about 2,000 electric-powered cars now on California's roads, and the ARB
wants that to increase tenfold and beyond, despite industry assertions that
battery technology isn't advanced enough. Californians lay out about $20
billion a year for a million new cars -- 2 percent of the state's personal
income stream. The ARB's decision could either create an entirely new
industry of nonpolluting cars, as advocates claim, or reduce the overall
supply of cars that can be legally sold and drive up Californians' costs, as
critics maintain. And Davis will get the credit or blame.
Although exact numbers are hard to obtain, it's likely that within a few
years, Californians will be spending another $20 billion a year to gamble,
mostly in casinos operated by Indian tribes, thanks to legislation signed by
Davis -- a major recipient of tribal political contributions. Cardroom
operators, who say they may be driven out of business by lavish new Indian
casinos, persuaded the Legislature to pass two bills that would allow them
to offer new card games, including a form of blackjack. But the tribes
oppose such expansion, obviously wanting to maintain what is rapidly
becoming a state-sanctioned monopoly on casino gambling, and Davis must
decide the bills' fate. Regardless of what he does, cardroom operators are
mulling a federal lawsuit alleging that the Indian monopoly on slot machines
violates federal law, which generally grants Indian casinos parity with
other forms of gambling.
The final 2-percent issue facing Davis poses the greatest peril to his
governorship: the huge run-up in electric utility costs in the wake of
deregulation. Utilities were paying about $20 billion a year for power
before the recent spike, but their costs now have doubled. San Diego
ratepayers got hit first, but those in other major metropolitan areas could
feel the pocketbook pain soon.
Davis signed two measures, one that rolls back San Diegans' power bills
temporarily, but could lead to balloon payments later, and another to speed
up siting of new power plants. But they are, at best, stop-gap measures, and
he may veto a third bill that would have the state directly underwrite the
higher utility bills. What the governor appears to be doing, by word and
deed, is to plead with the Public Utilities Commission and the Energy
Commission to get him off the hook.
The timing is critical because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison say they are absorbing billions of dollars in higher
wholesale costs that they can't immediately pass on to consumers thanks to a
rate freeze. The freeze is supposed to end in 2002, just as Davis is seeking
a second term, and if he and his utility regulators can't come up with a
solution by then, all hell could break loose as consumers' bills escalate
sharply and they look for someone to blame.
Davis may not have had anything to do with the original deregulation
legislation -- as he points out at every opportunity -- but he's stuck with
the problem now. Dealing with it could be critical to his political future.

"We are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 30th 
floor.  Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to 
densify the floor during the next several months while Enron Property 
Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32.   In the mean 
time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the 
capacity on the floor.  While these locations are not prime spots, people 
will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow.  Once the window 
seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign 
groups on the floor and people will need to move once again.

I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while 
she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations 
personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors.  Susan Harrison is 
working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition 
period.  Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and 
equipment on the 30th floor.  If there are any problems once a move has 
occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment, 
printers, etc.), please contact Chantelle at Ext. 3-6279 as she will also 
coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items.  If Chantelle is not 
available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup.  Maria can be reached at Ext. 
3-5586.

I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the 
window spaces.  We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and 
supplies on the floor.  Please coordinate with your assistant to have your 
area cleaned up by December 31.  During this clean-up process, if you have 
any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn 
Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext. 3-5237 and she 
will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a 
neat and professional work environment.  Between now and the summer of 2001 
when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are 
all working in a temporary and makeshift environment.  I would greatly 
appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available 
space effectively.

If I have missed anyone on the distribution list that has just recently moved 
to the 3oth floor, please forward this message to them.

Subject:        Contract expiration 

Just a reminder that the contract we signed with Ken Smith is set to expire at the end of October. Contract terms allow for renewal, or extension, by written agreement of the parties.  


Commencing on May 1, 2001 Enron agreed to pay Ken $4000/month at a maximum of 25 hours/month.  Hours worked in excess of 25/month are paid at a rate of $160/hour. 


Termination of the contract requires that Enron give Ken Smith 30 days advance notice.  
  
If we choose to terminate, I suggest that Karen Denne contact Ken by telephone and also provide written notice of the termination immediately (unless you all agree that we should extend the contract).


Please let me and Karen know how you want to proceed by close of business Thursday. Thanks

For what it's worth, I've read this, and if Laura Tyson or Larry Summers sign 
it, I have serious concerns about the effect it would have on their ability 
to play the role that we envision in moving our proposal forward 
(understanding that our odds of success are somewhat meager).  While I don't 
disagree with the language, it is strong and therefore very likely to make

   Paul,

   The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested
   in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn,
   senior vice president, Environmental and International Government
   Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said
   he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though
   I could not verify that he is now.

   The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
   ---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the
   near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
   ---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus
   strategies in participating countries?
   ---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How
   is Enron managing and hedging this position?
   ---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse
   gas mitigation?

   The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30
   to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

   I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let
   me know if there is any other information you need.

   ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
   of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
   that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
   for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
   Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
   the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
   still be there but we can try.

Do you still have the contact info for the escrow agent?  If so, it would be  
great it you would contact them directly.

The turbine contract is going back and forth between us and GE.  I expect 
that it may well be ready tomorrow.

I expect the Enron opinion letter to be an issue.

Subject: Delta Timetable


Kay:

Note the following timetable from the final version of the ENA/PPL letter
agreement:

(1)  ENA agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the final
form of the turbine contract on or before April 11, 2001.
(2)  The parties agreed to commercially reasonable efforts to execute an
escrow agreement on or before April 16, 2001.
(3)  The escrow account must be funded 3 business days after the later of
(a) ENA's delivery of the final form of the turbine contract and (b) the
closing of PPL's financing.
(4)  ENA can terminate if the escrow is not funded on or before April 19,
2001 (but this date gets pushed back by one business day for each business
day beyond April 11, 2001 that ENA delivers the final form of the turbine
contract).
(5)  The closing occurs at least 5, but not later than 10, business days
after funding the escrow account.
(6)  Either party may terminate if the closing has not occurred on or before
May 3, 2001.

If ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract on April 11, 2001,
then the April 19, 2001 right to terminate stands.  PPL's obligation to fund
the escrow would then be determined by the date of its loan closing.  Greg
Lang advises that they are working on PPL's financing, but he did not give
an estimated date for financial closing.  

I advised Greg on Friday that the legal opinions from both GE and Enron were
causing heartburn.  He agreed to pass this along to Isabel Parker.  He asked
today about GE's reaction to the consent document and if it would be
appropriate for Isabel Parker to contact GE directly at this point.  He also
requested a draft of the escrow disbursement instructions.  When you get a
chance, please advise of any comments in order that we can circulate for
PPL's review.  Also, we need to contact Citibank to clear the proposed form
of escrow agreement (and the anticipated disbursement instructions) and to
negotiate the fee.  Let me know if we can assist in this regard.  Thanks.

Property

Greetings Sally:
My name is Jeff Dasovich.  The Greens have been helping me develop 40 acres
of land that I bought just north of Anchor Bay (a couple of miles up the
hill from Highway One, about 1200 ft or so up) and they suggested that I
contact you.

The property is right in the heart of the Banana Belt and my property faces
south, is protected, and a such is very hot and sunny from late spring
through later summer/early fall.  The property has an abundance of water on
it.  Of course, the possibility of evening fog raises some tricky issues,
and I haven't done soil tests.  In short, while I think there are some
challenges, I'm convinced that there is at least the strong possibility
that I could grow grapes--around 10 acres or so.

I'm sure that you're extremely busy, but I'd be very interested in talking

Best,
Jeff"

RE:             E&G Purchases of Opus One 




While demand for Opus One has grown significantly, case production has 
remained level if in fact not declined-and will decline further for the 
1998 vintage. This has lead to very strict allocations in the marketplace 
and a need to conserve. 

Please note as of March 1, 2001, for all employees and growers of Opus One, 
Robert Mondavi Winery and Baron Philippe de Rothschild, purchase limits on 
the current vintage of Opus One will change from twelve to six 750 ml. 
bottles per person.  We expect to offer the current vintage, the 1997, 
until October of this year, at which time the 1998 will be released. 

Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation.

To get Terminal Server:  from his Enron Corp desktop he should click

We have received inquiries from several attorneys who attended only the 
Thursday session of the Enron Corp. Law Conference in San Antonio.  If you 
have not already contacted someone about CLE credit for Thursday,  please 
send an e-mail to Becky Zikes stating that you attended the Thursday 
session.  This will enable you to claim 3.50 hours total credit, with 1.25 
hours ethics credit for Thursday.  If you have any questions, please contact 
Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103.   Please respond by 
Thursday, May 31 since we need to finalize our CLE filings with the various 
state bar organizations. 


If you wish to receive CPE credit (for certified public accountants) for the 
Law Conference, please  send an e-mail to Becky Zikes and we will get the 
appropriate certificate prepared.  Again, any questions should be directed to 
Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103. 

Thanks for your help.

"Good timing.

You mentioned that there were a couple of things you thought should be added 
to the ""employee/consultant"" form.  Could you email me the topics so that I 
can take a look and make changes.  Once again I expect to be on an endless 
conference call, but I can work while I talk.

Subject: RE: Confidentiaility Agreements regarding enovate


Hi Kay -

You may recall that back in February, we almost finalized two
confidentiality agreements related to enovate L.L.C. activities.  Our
auditors will be sending to enovate shortly a letter indicating they would
like to review various books and records of enovate and ENA as its
activities relate to enovate.  In connection with the review, we need to
finalize those confidentiality agreements.

I have made the change you requested in the attached e-mail to both of the
agreements (PEC and enovate) and have attached below an execution copy of
the agreements for ENA to date and send to PEC and enovate for siganture.
Assuming the attached copies are acceptable, please have ENA sign two
originals of each agreement and send them to me.  I'll arrange for Bill
Morrow to sign the PEC agreement and work with Greg Penmen to have enovate
sign the other agreement.

If you have any questions, please call.  Thanks for your assistance.

Subject: CFTC Reauthorization

At his request, I met Lee Sachs, Assistant Treasury Secretary, who had 
requested the meeting after a brief conversation recently.  Lee said that 
senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week 
between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock 
futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation).  

As you know, the House completed committee work on HR 4541 before it 
recessed.  The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where 
differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions 
(Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking).  The Senate Agriculture Committee 
passed out the Senate version in July.  However, the bill is not moving 
quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant 
changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy 
language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about 
the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed 
for his support.  More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she 
would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year.  
What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's 
opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain 
his support of the legislation.

Lee Sachs message was just that.  I told Lee that we shared his desire to 
move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all 
non-agriculture commodities (including metals).  He said that we would have a 
difficult time defending the metals provision politically. But, Lee said  ""we 
would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language"" 
(which includes favourable language on energy and metals).   This is a 
positive development, because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and 
I hope ensures no veto threat on our issues.  However, I do not expect 
Treasury to be vocal in support of our position.  It is clear that 
Congressional leaders and the Administration want to get this bill done this 
year and there remains a good opportunity for enactment.

However, with less than 20 or so legislative days left, we need Senator Gramm 
to engage.  A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could 
be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences.  Gramm 
needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron.  Let me know your 
thoughts on this approach.   I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call 
and drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay/Sen. Gramm call.

"Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday 
morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in 
regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick 
Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will 
provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during 
the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has 
hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the 
details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will 
also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, 
which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a 
strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with 
Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael 
in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as 
possible.  

Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his  
business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we 
would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good 
ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron 
locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were 
focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on 
leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading 
operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be 
generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  

I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as 
she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but 
I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.  
It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in 
Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading 
operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.  
I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and 
offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role 
over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as 
needed.  

I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to 
discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your 
business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  

This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are 
conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have 
taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be 
a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.  
The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of 
North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a 
large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort 
in London will occur in mid April.  

Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to 
Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those 
drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business 
managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley 
suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final 
copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and 
Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip 
in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned 
the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I 
can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was 
pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was 
out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney 
and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to 
accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They 
understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.

In theory, there may be some jurisdictions that do not allow tapes to be

following language:

The parties to this Agreement agree that any such recording are admissable in

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I currently hold a post-doctorate position in the Mathematics
Department at the University of Texas at Austin (with a Ph.D.
in theoretical physics). Although my position here is renewable
until summer 2001, I would like to move on to a more dynamic field
where I can still use my analytical skills and mathematical knowledge.
Since attending a series of lectures on mathematical finance given
by Dr. Marc Potters last summer I started studying the subject on my
own and found it intriguing and challenging.

I am interested in a position in your group (RAC) at Enron.
Last fall in a Career seminar at UT you mentioned that people who are
interested can send you their resume. If this is still relevant, please
find below my resume (in Word 97 and text formats).
Thank you for your time.

Yours,
Nurit Krausz

Susan/Tana,

We have recently traded a deal on Enron Online in which the entity offering 
the trade was ENA and the entity entering the trade was EPMI Long Term Hedge 
(Power group hedging with ENA).  This is currently booked as RMT vs. EPMI 
Long Term Hedge.  Can we send out a confirmation based on ISDA terms since 
this is an Enron subsidiary per Global Counterparty?  I'm assuming this is 
just like doing a deal with Enron Global Exploration and Production, EES or 
ECT International, but let me know if I'm incorrect.

Thanks,

Stacey,  please find attached the completed marked up GTC that we need to 
finalize and re-submit to Crestar.

TO DO:    I have added a line in part 3 ( blue).  Add this section .  Either 
add in other terms that section 2 and 5 are not applicable for just delete 
them.. my preference is to just exclude them in the other terms piece rather 
than delete completely.


This will complete the monthy volumes confirm for Crestar. Make these changes 
and send back to me today. 

Thanks.

OTHER:  Please e-mail to me the latest version of the AOS balancing confirm 
and I will add changes that we went through. 

Call me if you have any questions but we are almost there... 

PS.  we must get this done now because as of Nov. 6 Crestar loses some of 
their staff and I don't want to start over on this process with new people.

Paul:

Got your voice mail regarding Anthony Pescetti running for a FERC seat.  Here are some quick thoughts.  Sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share.  Be happy to discuss further.

*	Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
*	Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.
*	Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs).
*	Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.
*	In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.
*	When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
*	Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
*	And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.
*	Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.

I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.  Just let me know.

I am pleased to report to you that I received a fax on Sunday from Bernard
Glatzer reading as follows:

""Andrew Hayes and Boies, Schiller & Flexner were discharged by me for
obvious cause two and one half weeks ago in the above entitled matters, but
have not yet filed the appropriate withdrawals pursuant to my specific

Jeff-

This is a guy from South Carolina who works with a bunch of industrial 
customers there.  At the last GridSouth meeting, he cornered Joe Connor and I 
and asked us about California and the price spikes there.  I told him a bunch 
of reasons why the price spikes happened, but it appears that he wants more 
information.

I would appreciate it if you would call him or if you could find someone else 
out there in CA to give him a call.  He is not super sophisticated, but he is 
the representative of some big clients, so I try to keep him happy.  [I think 
he represents Michelin and Nucor steel--two huge energy users in South 
Carolina.]

Thank you very much.

RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 2/23


RECENT EVENTS:

-- The week started off on a very positive note.  Monday was a holiday!
Tuesday, however, inevitably came along to spoil all the fun with last
minute committee hearing announcements for some significant bills.

-- SB 39x (Speier) was heard this week in the Senate Energy Committee.  Thi=
s
measure would define owners or operators of any electric generating facilit=
y
as a public utility subject to the state=01,s jurisdiction.  The bill also
places the CPUC in the role of determining scheduled maintenance outages fo=
r
generation units.  Although the bill goes much further, the author=01,s onl=
y
intention is to give the CPUC a role in coordinating power plant outages,
but seems to not understand the implications of doing it in the manner
outlined in the bill.  IEP opposed the bill and testified to that end along
with CMTA, the State Chamber of Commerce, Enron, WSPA, and the California
Cogeneration Council.  The usual cast of consumer groups supported the bill=
.
Of particular note during the hearing was the hostility shown to the
opposition by the Chair of the Committee, Senator Bowen.  The message from
the opposition clearly was ignored by the majority of the members as it
passed out of the committee on a party-line vote.  IEP is currently
reassessing its strategy on this particular issue because this is not the
only bill that proposes similar changes.

-- The Assembly Natural Resources Committee, chaired by Asm. Howard Wayne,
was scheduled this week to hear two siting bills.  The first was AB 34x (La
Suer), which would make various changes to the CEC siting process, includin=
g
some IEP-sponsored language.  IEP has a support if amended position on the
bill which has some technical and policy problems, but workable.  Last
minute amendments offered by Asm. Keeley forced Asm. La Suer to postpone a
hearing on the bill until next Monday (2/26).  However, because the Keeley
amendments basically gut the current language and turn it into a study bill=
,
La Suer is unlikely to accept them and, according to the negative committee
analysis, the committee is unlikely to approve the measure in its current
form.

AB 36x (Wright), on the other hand, passed the Natural Resources committee
with only one =01&no=018 vote.  AB 36x would provide expedited siting for a
repower project, as defined.  However, despite IEP=01,s efforts to get the =
bill
amended, the current language would help few, if any, repower projects.  Th=
e
author has agreed to continue working with us, the environmental community
and the CEC to develop language that works for everyone.  IEP=01,s major is=
sue
at this point is that is should actually work.  The measure was double
referred to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee and will b=
e
heard there next.

-- The negotiated language on the QF issue finally has a vehicle, SB 47x
(Battin).  All stakeholders are not united in their complete support for th=
e
measure.  IEP has may need some additional changes but will be mobilizing
members on Monday to educate Senators on the bill and support the measure i=
n
the Senate Energy Committee when it is scheduled for a hearing.  Both SCE
and WSPA also have some outstanding issues, but only WSPA so far will be
opposing the bill.

-- SB 6x (Burton), which would establish and state power and financing
authority, passed off the Senate Floor 24 to 14 this week and is headed to
the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee next. IEP met with
Senator Burton=01,s staff this week to talk about amendments to SB 6x relat=
ing
to limiting the Authority=01,s eminent domain powers.  Staff was open to wh=
at
we had to say but we have little confidence our recommendations will move
forward with the bill.  Regardless, IEP will continue to push for amendment=
s
on the Assembly side.

-- SB 33x (Burton), which would require the Governor=01,s plan to purchase =
the
IOU=01,s transmission to be approved first by the Legislature, is still
awaiting consideration on the Senate floor.

-- The Governor had another press conference today to provide a status on
the negotiations between the state and the three IOUs regarding the purchas=
e
of the utilities=01, transmission system.  Reuters is saying there the Gove=
rnor
has a deal with SCE to purchase its share of the power grid for $2.76
billion.  Negotiations are still going on with PG&E and SDG&E.  More
information on press conference can be found on the Governor=01,s web site.

--  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking report which includes
all the special session bills introduced through yesterday.  Please let me
know if you need copies of any of these bills.

"Here's the latest that we have on the legislation (""82XX"") released on Friday.
The Assembly Energy Committee will hold an ""informational"" hearing on 82XX at 
1:30 PM PDT today.
""Informational"" means that there won't be a vote today.
Attended a meeting this morning with the business groups with Assemblyman 
Dutra (self-proclaimed pro-biz Democrat, who's an ""author""  of 82XX), 
Hertzberg's chief staffer, and Hertzberg's outside legal consultant.
The DWR contracts continue to be the roadblock to a rational solution.
Dutra is unhappy with the process thus far----claimed he wasn't familiar with 
the ""more recent version"" of the bill, and was unhappy that there would be a 
hearing today---informational or otherwise--before he and the bill's other 
authors had agreed to final language from their perspective.
Dutra said that he was working to remove the Direct Access suspension and 
asked the biz groups to hold their fire until the amendments come out 
tomorrow.
PUC President Lynch continues to oppose striking a deal in which the 
Commission gives up all review of DWR's ""revenue requirement"" and simply 
flows all DWR costs through rates (but Davis and his administration are 
putting her under enormous pressure to buckle under and agree).
As a result, details of any ""rate agreement"" between DWR and the CPUC, and 
any public announcement by DWR of its ""revenue requirement"" is could be 
postponed until next week, unless there's a breakthrough with Loretta.
The Governor's consultants now claim (and will reportedly testify at the 
hearing today) that there is enough room in the 3 cent rate increase to cover 
both Edison's and DWR's revenue requirements.  (They cite lower gas prices 
and FERC's price cap as the driving force for the newly-found headroom, 
though many remain very skeptical.)
However, if the deal is applied to PG&E, it is unlikely that the 3 cent rate 
would be sufficient, according to the same consultants.
The plan (at this point) is to have the bill--with amendments--discussed in 
the same committee tomorrow, and voted out of the committee.  The bill would 
then be taken to the full Assembly for an up or down vote on Wednesday.
It is unclear whether, at this point, there is agreement among Assembly 
Democrats to vote the bill out of the full Assembly on Wednesday.
In addition, Senate Democrats continues to work on their own version  of an 
Edison ""MOU,"" and the working relationship between the Assembly side and the 
Senate side appears strained.
The Republicans in the Assembly are staunchly opposed to 82XX and are 
generally being ignored by the Democrats, since the Democrats need no 
Republicans to get a majority vote to pass bills.
Meanwhile, Edison continues to twist.

Will report back after the 1:30 hearing today.

If anyone has questions, don't hesitate to contact me by pager @ 888.916.7184.

I just added the PSE&G demand charges on Transco to our capacity worksheet.  The net impact is $0 because I'm also showing this as a reimbursement.  How should we put this in Sitara.  I'm showing a transport demand charge on the capacity deal ticket.  How do we get the money back from PSE&G?

Dear Dr. Kaminski

My name is Jaesoo Lew and I am referred by Dr. Wayne Lee.

Currently I've been working at Aquila Energy in Kansas City as an pricing
analyst since July 2000.  Since then, I have developed a natural gas storage
valuation model applying the swing options (forest method) pricing approach.
The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation
since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c++
programming using Excel DLL has been developed, too.

I attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking
forward to talking about an opportunity at Enron.

My home phone number is 913-649-0578, Dr. Kaminski, I will wait your call in
this week as Dr. Lee informed me.  If possible, please let me know your
expected calling day through the mail.  I appreciate your consideration.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew

Vince,

I have penciled you in for Nov 13th for my class.  Does this work for you?
This is a Monday and I would suggest you come up Monday afternoon, you can
give a brief talk to our department late in the afternoon, and then you can
talk to my Ex MBAs at 6 p.m. for an hour or so.  I'll get you to the hotel
for the evening and we can work on the paper Tuesday morning.  I recommend
this Mon noon through Tue noon arrangement since I will be out of town the
weekend before the 13th.  If this needs reshuffling let me know.  We'll
make it work.

I look forward to talking with you later this week along with Mark Palmer.

Subject:	RE: CA question

Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place.

We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero.  Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC.  AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality.

Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit (""market"" price) is now that there is no PX.  Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up""), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped ""adjusting"" the PX credit to recover past undercollections.  And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation.  Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run.

In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past.

I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne.  Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context.

I received call from Mart T of SW.   Following are two names with telephone

I would appreciate it if you would let me know when the inspection is 
arranged and when it to occur. (A telephone call would work best).    I think 
it makes sense for us to have an Enron project management/ technical 
representative present.-  Will you have someone from your office present- it 
might make sense given the  history on this- your call as to the present of 
an Enron RM person being present.   I assume we would have to inform the SW 
point of contact the names of the Enron people.

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya

We will need to catch a cab to get to La Fogata which is located at 2427 
Vance Jackson Road in San Antonio.  Our dinner reservations are for 7:00 pm, 
so I suggest we all meet in the hotel lobby at 6:30 and catch group cabs 
together.  Dress is casual.  The phone number for the restaurant is 
210-340-1337, in case you get lost in a wild cab ride or something similar 
(this will have special meaning to certain swap group members!).  If you 
haven't RSVP'd back to me, please do so, so I can get an accurate head count 
for tomorrow.

See you in San Antonio.

Tanya:

Bob Crane did a deal with the Canadian party identified below.  Sounds like 
he originally told our FX trader that the parties would be EGM (actually ENA) 
and Enron Industrial Markets (""EIM"").  In the end, EIM was not the correct 
party but the Canadian party was the correct party.

Is this trade between ENA and Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona authorized by 
credit?  Is the company eligible?

Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

"Steve,  Those were CPS's suggested changes, not mine.  I agree.  I don't know 
what they want for Section 6 and Jim has agreed to get with CPS to get 
further definition.  I also recommend pulling the language inserted in 
Section 3 as Jim indicated we have already submitted all the estimates.  The 
Bexar county venue is unacceptable and will be stricken.  David Marshall is

I have reviewed the changes which you have made.  Under Section 6, I have no 
idea what we would submit.  Therefore I suggest that the additions under this 
section be removed.  The insurance provision looks fine to me except that I 
would like to see a larger umbrella amount, but you need to get David 
Marshall to bless.  Is there a precedent for having Bexar County the point of 
venue under this contract?  Upon your completion, please send 3 copies to me, 
2 of which I will submit for execution to CPS.

Subject: Re: Price Cap Media--DRAFT  

I have a couple of suggestions on parts of the draft.

Media Action:
In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like, 
I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release 
statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next 
several weeks, such as:

1.  SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP.  Even if Enron isn't 
selected as the winning bid, the coalition should trumpet the market-based 
solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP.
2.  The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion.  We should be prepared to 
issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us.  With us, the 
market can and did provide reasonable, expedient solutions to SDG&E's 
customers and protection from price spikes.  Against us, despite the 
overwhelming market response, the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions 
and impose more regulation.
3.  Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal 
within the next couple of weeks.
4.  ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps.

Coalition Members:

Agree that those groups listed should be contacted, although the CMA, CRA, 
CIU, CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy.

I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch), PacTel, 
etc.)  NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores, San 
Diego-based, would give testimonials.  I could solicit the members of ARM to 
identify a key customer contacts for interviews.  

We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine 
growers, dairy industry, etc.)  We should also consider the water agencies 
and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg.  While the immediate 
message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of 
potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits 
of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective.  What about the City 
of Pittsburg?

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

 Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items o=
f=20
which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron=20
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=
=20
reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such=
=20
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse=
=20
impact on Enron=01,s financial position or its results of operations.

 Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harri=
s=20
County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company=20
(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company=20
(collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned=20
subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners=
=20
under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have=20
terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two=20
matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matte=
r,=20
the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and=20
negligent misrepresentation in connection with the =01&Panhandle program,=
=018 a=20
special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was=20
tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  =
In=20
the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated=
=20
state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing=
=20
to take the Plaintiffs=01, gas ratably with other producers=01, gas at cert=
ain=20
times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with=
=20
respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court=20
ruled that the trial court=01,s class certification was improper and remand=
ed=20
the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs=01,=
=20
claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statut=
e=20
of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a=
nd=20
factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no=
=20
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=
se=20
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=
r=20
results of operations.

 On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=
l=20
Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities,=
=20
bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San=
=20
Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a=20
propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide servic=
e=20
to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance=
=20
carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties,=20
including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telepho=
ne=20
Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their=20
insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for t=
he=20
District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits=
=20
seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and=
=20
property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years=
=20
without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not=
=20
to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements =
or=20
trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the=
=20
explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The=
=20
defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous=
=20
suits have been settled and 20 cases have been set for trial in the federal=
=20
court beginning in February 2001. Although no assurances can be given, Enro=
n=20
believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a=20
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

 Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric=20
Company (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power=20
generating facility (Trojan).  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Mario=
n=20
County, Oregon, found that the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) coul=
d=20
not authorize PGE to collect a return on its undepreciated investment in=20
Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling from the same court.  The ruli=
ng=20
was the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 1995 general rate order which=
=20
granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of its remaining investment i=
n=20
Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals and wa=
s=20
stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 1995 order.  Both PGE and =
the=20
OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling, which appeals were combined=
=20
with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at the Oregon Court of Appeals.=
 =20
On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon ruled that th=
e=20
OPUC does not have the authority to allow PGE to recover a rate of return o=
n=20
its undepreciated investment in Trojan.  The court upheld the OPUC=01,s=20
authorization of PGE=01,s recovery of its undepreciated investment in Troja=
n.

 PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court.  On August 26, 1998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for=
=20
review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the=
=20
Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE=01,s recovery of its=20
undepreciated investment in Trojan.  On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court accepted the petitions for review.  On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bi=
ll=20
3220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate=
d=20
investment in property retired from service was signed.  One of the effects=
=20
of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC=01,s authority to allow PGE=
=01,s=20
recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan.

 Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon=
=20
Supreme Court to vacate the June 24, 1998, adverse ruling of the Oregon Cou=
rt=20
of Appeals, affirm the validity of the OPUC=01,s order allowing PGE to reco=
ver a=20
return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decisio=
n=20
accepting the Utility Reform Project=01,s petition for review.  The Utility=

proceeding, opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of=
=20
State sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate th=
e=20
new legislation on the November 2000 ballot.  The Oregon Supreme Court has=

indicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000=20

assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=

 Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and=
=20
local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations requi=
re=20
expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the=20
operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating=

=20
Site (the Decorah Site) in Decorah, Iowa, pursuant to the provisions of the=
=20
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCL=
A,=20
also commonly known as Superfund).  The manufactured gas plant in Decorah=

ceased operations in 1951.  A predecessor company of Enron purchased the=20
Decorah Site in 1963.  Enron=01,s predecessor did not operate the gas plant=

A Measurement  Framework for Bank Liquidity Risk 
September 15,  2000
Raymond Cote
Vice President, FinRad Inc.

Raymond  Cote is Vice President, Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based  consulting firm offering financial management solutions that 
combine advisory  and systems development services to &corporations and 
financial  institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity risk, as opposed to credit and  market risks, has received little 
attention in professional or academic  journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk can be viewed as a  variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some concepts and  definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to measure a bank's  structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the framework with  modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure.  The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration of the  liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

Subject: Reminder

Vince,

Before leaving for India I just wanted to jot you this small reminder to talk 
to Jeff Shankman on Monday.

Aside from myself, I wanted to remind you to talk about Anshuman Shrivastava, 
who is currently Assistant Manager in India, and has my recommendation for 
promotion to Manager.  He is our point person on many DPC matters, and is 
also the person I have used on most fuel related issues.  He will be a real 
asset to Jeff when located in HOuston.  Sinc he is single, and quite young, 
it will not be a problem to move him here at short notice.

I will call you from India as soon as I get in.  It will be Monday evening in 
Houston at that time, so could you please jot me a note telling me what would 
be a good number to call you on.  

I look forward to working with the team in Research.

Thanks again,

Regards,
Sandeep.

"I have always worked right up until my due date.  There is a lot of waiting 
and somehow I thought that the time passed more quickly if I was in the 
office in my normal routine.  Meagan was due on Wednesday, May16.  I set my 
last date of work for Friday, May 11.  Mom came in that weekend for Mothers' 
Day ( you were with her, right?) and then we did stuff the next couple of 
days until Meagan was born.  With Amanda, I owned the shop at the time and I 
was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born.  She was a week 
late, so we just didn't know what to expect.  Tyler's due date was December 
18, and I set my last day of work for the Friday before that date.  Of 
course, then he was late, but we were in the throws of remodeling, so I was 
out picking out carpet and paint in those final days.  A lot of this probably 
depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have 
everything at the house ready.  I still had a lot of energy at the end of my 
pregnancies and I had also managed to get rooms ready early, so I enjoyed 
working as long as I could.  

Definitely make a point of you and Chris going to some movies at the theater 
before the baby comes.  You won't be able to do that for quite a while 
afterwards!!

Subject:	El Nino Forecast

I am with Enron?s thermal power generation company in Panama. Ours is the largest thermal power plant (320 MW) in a system with over 540 MW in hydro power capacity. In order to better program our operations for the next two years, it would help us to determine the probability of another El Nino event in the next 18 to 24 months. In case of a high probability we could even bring down a barge-mounted plant to provide back up power to Panama?s and other Central American countries which are heavily dependent on hydro power. Panama and Central America suffers serious droughts during an El Nino event.

Whatever help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

Mr. Jeffrey K. Skilling
President and C.O.O.,
Enron Corp.

Dear Jeff,

This email is from Robert Jarrow (Cornell) and myself (Joe Cherian). I hope
you recall meeting/lunching with Bob Jarrow & me when you keynoted at my
1999 Math Finance Day conference here at Boston University. I wanted to
introduce you to SKG Inc., a startup that is focused on providing an
innovative service to the electronic trading community. Messers Kuppuswamy
Seshadhri, Sriketan Mahanti, and Gaurav Mallik are the principal founders
of SKG, Inc. Bob Jarrow and I represent the company's Scientific Advisory
Board. Nobel laureate Robert Merton, who also sat on our table during your
keynote address, very kindly serves as an ad hoc Senior Advisor to SKG and
has been an invaluable resource to SKG, including putting us in touch with
JP Morgan. Coincidentally, the C.O.O. of JP Morgan Capital Corp. Ed
Colloton, in an April 7 meeting told us he would introduce us to the C.F.O.
of Enron Online, whom he knows and at which he felt SKG would have huge
value-adding opportunities. However, given Ed's busy travel schedule, I
don't believe he has been able to do that yet. Hence this joint decision by
Bob Jarrow and myself to send you this email.

SKG's solution is to provide dynamic pricing and value maximization in
electronic trading of securities/commodities on ECNs and ATSs (Alternative
Trading Systems). It achieves this through a process of ""strategic
negotiation"" using automated agents (intelligent software manifestations).
Our system should not be viewed as an ECN, but rather as an enhancement to
any extant trading system, be it an ECN, ATS, CLOB, NASDAQ, etc. Our
initial system design has been conducted for financial instruments trading,
e.g. bonds/equities, but our strategy is as much applicable to energy/power
instruments trading, high speed communications bandwidth trading, and other
web-based commodities trading, which we believe is of interest to Enron
Online.

SKG is superior to existing solutions in the following way:
1)  It considers multiple attributes, e.g., price, time, volatility,
bandwidth. (In high speed communication bandwidth scenarios, for example,
the dimensions could be price, bandwidth size, time for which bandwidth
available, continguity of the allocation, and such.)
2) It involves dynamic matching as opposed to ""static"" matching.
3) It is multi-lateral.
4)  It adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions.
5) It allows traders to make important trade-offs, as they do in
traditional markets.

Currently, SKG is involved in discussions with the Heads of Trading at
Fidelity, Putnam Investments, Lehman Bros., KPMG, Meridien Research,
Salomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, State Street, Banc of America, McKinsey,
Citizens Power, and a host of other folks.

We think we have a value-adding service to provide to Enron Online or any
other Enron subsidiary that the SKG offering matches and that you deem fit.
SKG's founders and I will be very happy to provide you or your
representative(s) with more details, including a demo of the prototype, in
a meeting. We are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange
something appropriate.

Thanks very much, Jeff! We look forward to hearing from you.

With warm regards,
Joseph Cherian and Robert Jarrow

		 Subject: Year 2000 - Accomplishments

Peter - Some time ago you suggested that at year end review time I should 
provide you with a list of significant accomplishments.  The following is 
such list:

January through June with ENA
NSTAR All RequirementsTransaction - While similar in structure to the United 
Illuminating transaction, the NSTAR deal provided challenge in that it came 
together in a very accelerated time frame.  We did not have the luxury of 6 
months of negotiations as we did in UI.  We essentially structured and 
executed a deal in less than 3 weeks.  It was also a challenge in that I had 
no experience working with these particular clients (Kevin Presto, Dana 
Davis, Ed Baughman and John Llodra of East Power Trading/Mid Markets.  
Another significant hurdle was the education process of the utility and its 
attorneys which was essential to get them comfortable with the complexities 
of an all requirements trading document.
Consolidated Edison Turbine deal - This transaction was blown up at the 
eleventh hour, it was another challenging deal which required a creative 
structure to flip turbines into a project and take back a call on power.  
Again the education of the utility and structuring of the transaction made 
this particular deal difficult.

July through November with ECC
Sunoco structured power transaction - This was the first project I worked on 
in the Toronto office and was the first back to back transaction completed 
off of the British Energy PPA.  While the Calgary lawyers had put together a 
very good back to back precedent, there was still a great deal of negotiation 
involved in completing the deal and complexity involved in maintaining the 
requisite back to back transaction.
G-6 structured transaction - This deal just (as of 40 minutes ago) blew up.  
Notwithstanding that the deal will not be completed, it was a very 
complicated deal which involved a highly negotiated services agreement, 
arrangements for ECC to take initial equity and an option for additional 
equity and trading documentation.  This project required negotiating with 6 
municipal electric utilities who were trying to set up a retail affiliate to 
market power in Ontario.  The structure would have ECC as a risk management 
and settlement services provider in exchange for being the exclusive 
wholesale supplier of energy to the G-6.  This involved mitigating and 
structuring around a myriad of legal issues.
TransCanada structured power transaction - This was another back to back 
transaction off of the British Energy position.  These deal was challenging 
in that it involved a more sophisticated counterparty who had certain 
idiosyncratic issues such as regulatory risk and credit.  We were able to 
structure a deal which balanced the parties competing interests and 
maintained the commercial value of the transaction for Enron.
OEFC Non-Utility Generation Contract Management - We have just recently been 
awarded the project and have begun negotiations with OEFC regarding 
management of the NUG contracts.  However, the teamwork exhibited among legal 
and commercial and between the Toronto and Calgary legal and commercial 
groups showed how effective the ECC operation can be.  Your advice and 
initial review together with my implementation structured an RFP response 
that did the right thing: protected ECC from potential legal risks.  While 
there was commercial pressure to bend from these principals we stood our 
ground and as a result have a much stronger bargaining position.
Transition from Houston to Toronto - While both you and Mark know that there 
were some initial issues with respect to working out the arrangements for my 
move from Houston to Toronto I believe that I have transitioned quite 
smoothly.  I think that I have quickly gained the respect and trust of those 
in the Toronto office and of Rob Milnthorp.  Being the lone lawyer in a 
satellite office presents unique challenges; especially when the commercial 
folks are not content doing bread and butter type transactions but rather 
present highly structured deal on a weekly or even daily basis.  I understand 
and appreciate that you have gone out of your way to provide support to me 
when I have had issues arise on Toronto matters. In return I feel that I have 
provided you with comfort that the legal interests of Enron Canada are being 
protected and that our commercial team is receiving top notch legal support.  
I have done this while still managing all of the little things that go along 
with moving your family 2000 miles.


Regards
CJG

Firms                                        All Clearing Member Firms
       All Compliance Officers and Operations Managers

FROM: Neal Wolkoff; Executive Vice-President

RE: Proposal to Increase Clearing Member Capital Requirement
_________________________________________________________________

The Clearing House Committee has proposed to the Board of Directors (""Board"") 
that the capital requirement of a clearing member firm be increased to $5 
million.

However, the Board is giving interested parties an opportunity to apply for 
clearing member privileges while the capital requirement remains at its 
current level of $2 million. Thus, if a firm files with the Exchange a 
clearing member application no later than May 31, 2001, it will not be 
required to meet the new $5 million requirement until one year later, May 31, 
2002. The same effective date would apply to all existing Clearing Members.

Applications for clearing membership can be obtained from the Membership 
Department. If the Exchange does not receive any new clearing member 
applications by May 31, 2001, the proposed capital requirement increase to $5 
million will become effective for all existing clearing member firms on June 
30, 2001.

Should you have any questions regarding these issues please contact Artie 
McCoy, Vice President of Financial Surveillance at 212-299-2928 or Joe 
Sanguedolce, Director, at 212-299-2855.

he first detailed allegations that Enron
abused mark-to-market accounting to
hide wholesale trading losses have
emerged in congressional testimony pro-vided
by a professor and former deriva-tives
trader who reviewed the Enron case
for Senate Governmental Affairs Com-mittee.
Those charges, along with allega-tions
that have surfaced that mark-to-market
accounting was misused by Enron
Energy Services, the company's retail
energy and services unit, are expected to
support the push by accounting rulemak-ers
for much more disclosure on mark-to-market
accounting practices and the
impact of mark-to-market accounting on
earnings trading firms' earnings.
In testimony Thursday before the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
last week, Frank Partnoy of the Universi-ty
of San Diego Law School, said it
appears that Enron traders mismarked
forward curves and manipulated the
amount of profits and losses that would
be reported in financial statements.
""In a nutshell, it appears that some
Enron employees used dummy accounts
and rigged valuation methodologies to cre-ate
false profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-atives
Enron traded,"" said Partnoy, who
reviewed the case over several weeks at the
committee's request. ""It appears that Enron
traders selectively mismarked their forward
curves, typically in order to hide losses.""
""Traders are compensated based on
their profits,"" he observed, ""so if a trader
can hide losses by mismarking forward
curves, he or she is likely to receive a
larger bonus.""
Partnoy said mismarking forward
curves was not the only problem.
""For each trade,"" he testified, ""a
trader would report either a profit or loss,
typically in spreadsheet format. These
profit-and-loss reports were designed to
reflect economic reality. Frequently they
did not. Instead of recording the entire
profit for a trade in one column, some
traders reportedly split the profit from a
trade into two columns. The first column
reflected the portion of the actual profits
the trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rent
financial statements. The second col-umn,
ironically labeled the 'prudency'
reserve, included the remainder.""
Partnoy told the committee that in
his estimation, ""Enron's 'prudency'
reserves did not depict economic reality,
nor could they have been intended to do
so. Instead, 'prudency' was a slush fund
that could be used to smooth out profits
and losses over time. The portion of prof-its
recorded as 'prudency' could be used
to offset any future losses,"" he said.
He recommended that investigators
question Enron employees who were
involved in these transactions ""to get a sense
of whether my summaries are complete.""

PG&E

On page 5-3 in Chapter 5 Supplemental Testimony, PG&E states, ""Decision 
97-05-088 also provides that, following the end of the ICIP rate, Diablo 
Canyon shifts to a sharing mechanism under which benefits from generation 
would be shared with ratepayers through divestiture, appraisal or profit 
sharing.""  Is this interpretation predicated on an end to the rate freeze?  
PG&E also states, ""PG&E's proposal in the RSP for Diablo Canyon is to defer 
its 50 percent share of market revenues for two years and to apply all market 
revenues in excess of ICIP to the UCSA.  PG&E proposed to track in the 
'Diablo Canyon Deferred Debit Account ('GDDA') the shareholder revenues 
(including interest) provided to ratepayers during this two-year period so 
that they may be recovered from market revenues in years three through 
five.""  What ""reasonably-based market price benchmark"" does PG&E propose to 
rely upon?  Based on PG&E's forward view of this benchmark for the next two 
years, what is PG&E's estimate of the 50 percent shareholder share of 
foregone market revenues that will be tracked?  On page 2-2 in Chapter 2 
Supplemental Testimony, PG&E refers to an estimated average spot power market 
price of over $180 per MWH for 2001, using this price what would PG&E's 
shareholders 50% share be for 2001?  What if it is assumed a 17 million mWh 
output, the sunk costs are recovered, and a going forward operating cost of 
$20 per mWH?  (The answer would be in excess of $1.3 billion)  Is this share 
calculated on a before- or  after-tax basis?  Does the amount that would 
receive deferred recovery be income for PG&E?

In Chapter 2 Errata and Update Testimony, PG&E proposes a ""rate 
stabilization"" policy.  PG&E is currently proposing to raise rates in January 
2001.  Within the next two years, are there any other factors that will cause 
rates to increase?  Can rates increase for transmission rates currently filed 
at FERC?  Can rates increase for increases to distribution rates?  How 
frequently could rates change under PG&E's proposed ""trigger mechanism"".

In Chapter 2 Testimony, PG&E also proposes to establish a ""Unrecovered Cost 
of Service Account Rate"" and in Chapter 6 Testimony proposes to recover 
ongoing CTC from all customers.  How will Direct Access customers receive the 
stranded benefits from retained generation (hydro, nuclear, and fossil) as 
well as potential stranded benefits from QF energy?

Pennsylvania's First Successful CDS Auction
=20
An important new regulatory skirmish has broken out before the Pennsylvania=
=20
Public Utility Commission (PUC) over which company has won the right to=20
provide default generation service to 300,000 customers of PECO Energy, an=
=20
Exelon Company. This skirmish is actually good news for consumers and is th=
e=20
fruit of the 1998 PECO Energy restructuring settlement agreement, a landmar=

document that ended a ferocious regulatory war when all combatants signed i=
t.=20
=20
The =01&peace treaty=018 includes a requirement that PECO Energy bid out de=
fault=20
service for 20% of its customers, and PECO has done so. Green Mountain Ener=

Company is now challenging PECO Energy=01,s decision that New Power won the=

auction to provide the settlement=01,s mandated default service.=20
=20
Both Green Mountain and New Power are offering those 300,000 consumers smal=

and more electricity generated from renewable energy resources. Specificall=

New Power and Green Mountain are offering generation service to Rate R=20

=20
generation and transmission rate of 8.65 cents per kilowatt-hour and 0.11=
=20
cents per kilowatt-hour less than the shopping credit of 5.65.=20
=20
The consumer savings that these offers represent is masked or reduced by th=

stranded cost payments that consumers must pay PECO Energy. Indeed, were it=

not for stranded cost payments, the New Power and Green Mountain offers wou=

reduce total bills by about 3.11 cents per kilowatt-hour, or 20%.=20
=20
The dispute between New Power and Green Mountain is noteworthy because it=

proves that companies will compete vigorously to provide default service if=

shopping credits and lengths of contracts are set at reasonable levels. It=

also shows that renewable energy portfolio standards can be met economicall=

Finally, the result of this case will switch more customers to competitive=

a=20
period of nearly three years.=20
=20
When the PUC anoints New Power or Green Mountain as the winner, if all=20
299,300 consumers opt to stay with the CDS provider, the total number of=20
customers in Pennsylvania that will be served by a competitive supplier wil=
l=20
jump to more than 850,000. Of this total, 504,000 will be residential=20
customers of PECO, a number equal to 37% of the PECO residential class.

The same approach was used in the other Settlements in the GPU, PPL and APS=

I just spoke with Mike Day.  He received a call back from Harvey Morris at
the CPUC.  They have not yet had a chance to read our response and cannot
convene the group that needs to look at it until tomorrow.  (Mike reads that
as they are giving it to a consultant for comment.)  We have a scheduled
conference call with Harvey for 10:00 a.m. PDST on Friday.  I will call in
from Mexico.  Peter will set up an 800 number and call in ID.  Once Mike,
Peter and I are on the phone, we will conference in Harvey.

With respect to the production of documents, I told Mike that the documents
were being shipped here and we would process them on Friday.  We will
address delivery on the 10:00 conference call.

As an aside, Harvey apparently said that a number of other companies had
decided to cooperate after being threatened by the CPUC staff.

If you need to reach me in Cancun, the Brobeck satellite office number there
is 011-52-98-810962.

Well, here's a chance to take your mind off of things.  I've got a pair of exceptional 49er tickets--lowest section in 2nd tier, right on the 50 yardline. (My girlfriend's parents season tickets. I can't use them--in fact, ain't crazy about football)  They're playing the Saints, which will be a great game.  

I'm selling them for face value, which is $50 each.  Like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible.  If you're interested, please let me know ASAP.

"I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it 
right away.

Thanks for your help on this,
Kate

Help, I'm confused!  Yesterday I prepared a confirmation for three Montana 
Power deals, # 5467244, 597245, 597246.  I sent it to John Malowney and he 
approved it and I faxed it out. Today I noticed two of the deals have been 
killed and two legs added to the other deal.  I think it is the same deal, 
but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

Thanks!

"The missing Richter trades are all EES sleeves that he neglected to enter 
before leaving for Houston this afternoon. Since Risk is running their calc, 
Chris Mallory said he's enter the deals first thing in the morning. 

The Fischer deals - 563728 and 563729 - have been changed to Constellation, 
per Matt Motley who did the trades.

And the other two deals where the brokers have been changed look fine. Would 
you let me know beforehand next time, just in the offhand chance that the 
trader entered other things in the deal incorrectly? Thanks for your help.

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .

1.  We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for 
production months older than 12/1999.  This allows us to focus our efforts on 
current month.  Per Bryce, applaud here! 

2.  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected 
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.

3.  Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected 
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.

4.  Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator.  Changes should be made 
effective 12/1999 production forward.  

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions.  If 
necessary, please forward to your teams.

Subject: Rates Corrections

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates 
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999.  (Applause 
here!)  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled via a manual line item.  

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date, 
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type.  For example, if you are 
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity.  Same 
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be 
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting.  Any 
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close.  The Rates team will 
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31.  This should allow you time to 
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we 
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within 
Unify/Sitara.  Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by 
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and 
reversed by the end of the same accounting month.  For items that have been 
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be 
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management 
coordinator.  They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production 
forward.  

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by 
the end of 2/2000 accounting...  Once the numbers booked in Unify are final, 
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

4.   Section 9 - The following sentence should be added to the definition o=

Lonesome Dove. That was really neat. Then we drove to Alpine and Fort Davis.
We spent the night in the Davis Mountains Indian Lodge. We also saw Fort
Collins,that night and the next day we drove to the McDonalds Observatory in
the Davis Mountains. We got to look through all the big telescopes at the
moon, venus, and saturn. The next day we went back to look at the sun and
they took us to the Hobby Eberle telescope and told us all about it. Then we
drove to Big Bend Park and stayed at the Lodge at the base of the Chiso
Mountains. There is so many variations of rocks, mountains and deserts in
that area. It was really something to see.

Company Press Release

Enron Hosts Annual Analyst Conference; Provides
Business Overview and Goals for 2000

HOUSTON, Jan. 20 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - news) hosted its 
annual equity analyst conference today in
Houston. Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the 
conference by highlighting Enron's tremendous
growth across all businesses and the outstanding 700 percent return to 
shareholders over the past decade. 

     Enron presented key objectives for 2000:
     Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.
     Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.
     Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.

Enron's ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a 
recurring theme throughout the day.

Wholesale Energy Business

Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services, 
Enron's largest business. Wholesale energy
growth in North America is expected to be driven by the continuing 
deregulation of power markets in the United States and
large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers. Enron 
expects to continue to broaden its early lead
across the European continent as markets quickly open to competition. 
Finally, Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale
presence in other markets such as Japan, where large customers will be 
permitted to choose their electricity provider in March
2000.

EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are 
generated through this innovative, Internet-based
transaction system. Over 450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline 
and over 10,000 transactions have been
completed since its introduction in late November 1999. Yesterday, 
EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with
over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. 
Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are
significantly lower than costs associated with traditional transaction 
methods.

Enron's Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, with 
expansions planned or underway on several of its
systems.

Retail Energy Services

With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in place 
to service customers worldwide. As the strong
contracting momentum continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly 
increase earnings in 2000. Enron Energy Services'
goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts representing $16 billion in future 
expenditures by customers for energy and energy
services, nearly double the level in 1999.

Enron Broadband Services

The new name of Enron's communications business, Enron Broadband Services, 
reflects its role in the very fast growing market
for premium broadband services. Enron is deploying an open, flexible global 
broadband network controlled by software
intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in a traditional 
point-to-point fiber network. This Enron Intelligent Network is
widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to 
Internet service providers, thus providing the platform
for two new Enron business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband 
content delivery.

A direct transfer of Enron's core market making and risk management skills 
from its energy businesses, bandwidth
intermediation will provide capacity- holders a vast array of alternatives 
for flexible, low cost capacity. Enron will also provide
premium broadband content services, such as high-quality video-streaming and 
large broadband file transfer, with differentiated
levels of quality in a usage-based business model.

As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Sun 
Microsystems that provides for accelerated
development of broadband Internet services.

Enron is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and 
communications companies. The company, which owns
approximately $34 billion in energy and communications assets, produces 
electricity and natural gas, develops, constructs and
operates energy facilities worldwide, delivers physical commodities and 
financial and risk management services to customers
around the world, and is developing an intelligent network platform to 
facilitate online business. Enron's Internet address is
www.enron.com, and the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, ``ENE.''

This press release includes forward looking statements within the meaning of 
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although Enron believes 
that its expectations are based on reasonable
assumptions, it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved. 
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include 
political developments in foreign countries, the ability to
penetrate new wholesale and retail natural gas, electricity and broadband 
services markets, including the energy outsource
market, in the United States and Europe, the timing and extent of changes in 
prices for crude oil, natural gas, electricity and
those relating to broadband services and content, the timing and effect of 
changes in interest rates, the timing and success of
Enron's efforts to develop domestic and international power, pipeline, 
communications, internet- related and other infrastructure
projects, and conditions of the capital markets and equity markets during the 
periods covered by the forward looking
statements.

"PG&E utility reorganization draws fire in Calif 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - PG&E Corp.'s plan to reorganize its bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric unit, California's biggest utility, is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation. 
Critics said that with California beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the state's utilities in red ink, now is no time to abandon state oversight. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), called the plan ""a regulatory jailbreak"" and ""a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation"" by transferring assets to unregulated PG&E affiliates. 
The reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies, transferring the hydro network, Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent PG&E. 
The utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers. 
The plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout, said Bob Glynn, chairman, president and chief executive of PG&E. 
It would provide creditors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. 
EYE ON HYDRO SYSTEM 
One of the concerns arising from the plan is how Pacific Gas & Electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties, which make up the world's largest privately held hydropower system. 
Elected officials from 28 counties in PG&E's sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern California will meet Friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the San Francisco federal bankruptcy court Sept. 20. 
The Regional Council of Rural Counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro system's rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing, boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state, council vice president Wes Lujan told Reuters. 
PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said the hydro system, nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
The utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12-year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour. 
But State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of ""serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the CPUC"" and avoid state laws on the asset transfers. 
Lockyer said that in the past, PG&E had used CPUC oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny. 
Despite PG&E's claim that the CPUC has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent, CPUC chief counsel Gary Cohen said the agency's approval is required under state law. 
'FIRE SALE PRICES' 
""PG&E's goal is clear. They want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company, at fire sale prices, so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation. It is a deregulation plan, not a reorganization plan,"" Cohen said. 
""PG&E's plan conflicts with California's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system. Deregulation has failed the public, and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation,"" said Doug Heller, of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
PG&E's Tremayne said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PG&E would continue to own and manage power production and transmission. 
Tremayne said, however, the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company. 
PG&E's plan would give the utility $4.5 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $13 billion in debts, including $9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs. 
The CPUC's Cohen and consumer groups said PG&E should receive far more than $4.5 billion from the assets. 
They point to the value of the hydro network. Last fall, the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $2.8 billion because the system was ""undervalued in today's market"" and could fetch a much higher price through an auction. 
The PG&E utility and Edison International's Southern California Edison utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers. 
SoCal Edison and the CPUC reached a deal Oct. 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors. "

Proposal to Alleviate California=01,s Electricity Shortage
Through Incentives to Reduce Demand

Objective
=06=15 Provide consumers with financial incentives to reduce demand in=20
anticipation of Summer 2001 electricity demand

Proposal
=06=15 The California PUC should require the utilities to immediately condu=
ct=20
on-line auctions for demand reductions totaling at least 2,000 MWs
=06=15 Alternatively, DWR could run the auction and implement the buy-down=
=20
program.  However, if it is determined that DWR requires additional authori=
ty=20
to execute the auction, the State should avoid any further delays and direc=
t=20
the CPUC to order the utilities to implement the buy-down program immediate=
ly.

The Auction Process (assuming the utilities implement the program)
=06=15 Businesses and large consumers willing to commit to sustained reduct=
ions=20
through November 1, 2001 would submit bids indicating the price they would =
be=20
willing to receive for a given quantity of permanent reduction=20
=06=15 If the =01&supply=018 of available reductions offered in the auction=
 exceeds=20
2,000 MWs, the utility should accept them, or explain to the Commission why=
=20
they chose not to accept them=20
=06=15 Businesses should be permitted to include in their bids the continue=
d=20
payment of wages to compensate employees for hours of employment foregone d=
ue=20
to demand reductions

A Single Price Approach
=06=15 A single price approach to a demand buy down program has two key=20
disadvantages:
=06=15 First, customers who would be willing to reduce demand for a lesser =
price=20
will be overpaid, much in the same way the single price auction in the PC=
=20
overpaid lower cost generators.  The state would overpay for reduced demand=
=20
under the single price approach.
=06=15 Second, the single price may not attract sufficient demand reduction=
s.
=06=15 Further, the single price approach does not provide greater certaint=
y=20
regarding the cost of demand reductions.  By conducting an auction the stat=
e=20
will be able to observe all bids and pay on an as bid basis, starting with=
=20
the lowest bids necessary to provide the required demand reductions up to t=
he=20
cost the state is willing to pay.
=06=15 A single price approach, however, could work if targeted at customer=
s who=20
would not participate in an auction, i.e. residential customers.  A well=20
publicized program of rebates to residential customers who use less than la=
st=20
year would further reduce demand in the state.  Thus the auction and the=20
single price could be structured in a complimentary fashion.
=06=15 The costs of the incentive program should be paid for by all consume=
rs,=20
since all consumers will benefit from the decreased risk of service=20
interruptions caused by the demand reductions
=06=15 If DWR implements the program, DWR=01, would recover its costs throu=
gh rates,=20
similar to the cost recovery mechanism used to recover power purchase costs=
.
=06=15 If the utilities implement the program, the California PUC would inc=
lude=20
program costs in rates collected from customers
=06=15 The auction should be conducted online which will increase transpare=
ncy and=20
reduce the time required to complete the process

Hazards to Avoid
=06=15 Avoid allowing lengthy utility and/or PUC review to delay implementa=
tion of=20
the reductions
_ Any unnecessary delay increases the chance that California will fail to=
=20
achieve the reductions needed to help avoid severe shortages in Summer 2001
_ There are numerous firms offering moderately-priced on-line auction=20
services that can quickly provide auction services to the utility
_ The utility should immediately contract for on-line services and present=
=20
the contract to the California PUC for prompt approval
_ The utilities should also include in their submittal to the PUC a simple,=
=20
streamlined set of pre-qualification criteria that would apply to bidders
_ The pre-qualification criteria should be designed with the goal of making=
=20
participation as easy and expansive as possible
_ Pre-qualification will encourage legitimate offers and reduce transaction=
=20
time
_ Once the PUC has approved the auction process, the PUC should not apply a=
ny=20
additional review to the auction results
_ Auction =01&pre-approval=018 will ensure that the utilities are actively =
and=20
constructively engaged

Actions
=06=15 Governor=01,s office directs PUC to initiate auction and residential=
 program
=06=15 CPUC directs utility to submit auction proposal within 30 days
_ Establish abbreviated schedule
_ Provide parties with abbreviated opportunity to comment

Steve is giving testimony today before the US Senate Comm. on Energy and 
Natural
Resources in support of the dereg bills.  His oral testimony states that TVA 
has
refused to provide us with the same service it provides to itself.  Both the
oral and written testimony seek a new NERC, comparable treatment for native 
load
uses of the system, and ""green tags"" at the generator (not traced through to 
the
end user).  He will also discuss recent transmission access problems we have
encountered (new tag requirements , unannounced scheduling deadline changes, 
TLR
cuts, wrong info on the NERC redispatch page, etc.)

I received this list from the Confirms group this morning. Looks like they 
need quite a few unit names for confirmation purposes. But if I remember 
correctly, you didn't want these deals confirmed. Please let me know when you 
get a chance, and I can go through and either change them to ""no confirm"" or 
add the unit names.

Steve,

Actually, EOL and other units of Enron have declined to participate and 
specifically asked not to be included in the press release.  Confidentially, 
this is a case of a developer overselling use of the Enron name for 
approximately $5 million equity stake.  We have caught him in many half 
truths and are uncomfortable going too far with this since we might get be 
placed in an awkward position.  Because of EOL and our own concerns, we 
intentionally toned it down.  I believe, in fact, that it is just another 
platform as well as an investment.  Consequently, we would prefer to keep 
this to the minimum of allowing them to issue a press release as included in 
the contract.  Your concurrence would be appreciated.  I am available, if you 
wish to discuss this further.

John

Looks fine as far as it goes ... but don't we want to explain how this fits 
in to our strategy?  Is it just another platform for us to bring our products 
and prices to the market?  We have said with respect to EOL that the 
transaction is the goal not the platform.  Do we want to position this the 
same way?  Examples of other press releases include our extension of pricing 
on EOL to the two other platforms (including Houston Street) which we did a 
couple of months ago.

Enron Global Markets (EGM) has entered into a cooperative agreement with

contract allows Envera to issue a press release, subject to our approval.

"THIRD EXTRAORDINARY SESSION CALLED 
Governor Davis has called a special session on Tuesday, October 9 to consider and act upon legislation affecting the operation, maintenance, finances, and financial viability of investor-owned utilities that provide electricity or natural gas to California residents and businesses, including their procurement portfolios and practices, and service by alternate energy providers in their service territory. 
Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures
Call of Special Session: 
Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. 
Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals: 
The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. 
Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications: 
Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. 
Introduction of Special Session Bills: 
There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. 
Special Session Bill Procedures and Calendars: 
There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the ""30-day in print"" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. 
Effective Date of Special Session Legislation: 
Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. 
End of Special Session: 
Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto. "

Subject: VEPCO Information Request

To all:

In our last meeting with VEPCO we presented a structure that would 

1).  Allow Enron to sell the Edgecombe plant to VEPCO at a fixed price at the 
end of the term of the PPA (around $325/kW)
2).  Allow VEPCO to buy the plant from us at a fixed price at the end of the 
term of the PPA (around $425/kW).

This structure caps our downside risk into a quantifiable number (it also 
limits our upside but we're willing to give that up to protect against a big 
negative hit).


In order to evaluate this structure, VEPCO has asked for some specific plant 
information.  We have most of this info in various forms and I would like 
your help pulling it together.

1).  Full plant description (equipment, design, drawings)
2).  Construction costs (have we gotten updated NEPCO numbers for this 
project?)
3).  Permits (timeline for obtaining, run hours allowed on both natural gas 
and fuel oil, emission limits)
4).  Fuel contracts (in process).

Please let me know what you have and an estimate on timing to get the rest of 
the request.

If we can negotiate this structure with VEPCO, we will make a significant 
jump in getting the internal okay to move forward.

Thanks for your help,

Heather

"Good afternoon, IT Wizards -

I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report. It is now 
possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In 
the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my 
desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed 
to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the 
difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. 
Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a 
chance.

Jeff Dasovich and I, along with several IEP members, met with Gov Davis'=20
staff today, including his Chief of Staff, his Staff Director and two polic=

advisors on energy issues.  They made the following points:

The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20

a big part of the problem is a ""dysfunctional market"" -- a thinly veiled=20
reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room.
The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20

Everyone must ""share the pain"".
The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20

While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the=

fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.

The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of=

new information.  The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments=

about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmissi=

nd=20
remain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the sta=

(at least at peak times), etc.  One approach they appear to be toying with =
is=20
a ""share the pain"" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th=

deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo=
rm=20
of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either=

agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.

The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis=

problem. =20

I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.  We should, as=

Kay,

I am back at the plate for another shot at your schedule.  There is a 
Distinguished Speaker Luncheon this Thursday at noon at the Houston Club 
featuring Larry Dierker, Milo Hamilton and Jerry Hunsicker of the Houston 
Astros.  Could you please be a guest at our table?  Hawaiian shirts are 
required.

Let me know.  Hope you can make it.

"Jeff,
 I had informed them that I was out Monday, however they scheduled the 
meeting anyway.  I forwarded our standard enfolio to Teresa for this deal.  
She wants to delete the $0.15 from 3.2 and 3.4.  I suggested that we delete 
it in the transaction documents, but I think she will insist that it be taken 
out of the master.  I had requested that they invite Scott Neal to the 
meeting to discuss what they viewed as their obligation if the producer did 
not deliver the production payment volumes.  They had suggested that they use 
the enfolio default mechanism to calculated the $ damages, but in lieu of 
paying the $s, they would deliver a volume equal to such $s in a future 
undefined period.  Later they agreed that because of the financial hedge that 
was being put into place, they could pay such $ damages  at the time of 
default.  
 If they need someone from gas trading, can you attend Monday.  I am going to 
leave Teresa a message requesting that she try to get Scott Neal or his 
representative to attend and to let you know if your attendance was needed.

Subject: Merger of NationsBank and Bank of America - Enron Corp.

Re:  Enron Corp.

 We have received a letter agreement from Bank of America setting forth the 
terms of the referenced merger as they relate to our ISDA Master Agreements 
currently in place with Enron Corp. and each of  Bank of America and 
NationsBank.  Credit and Legal have agreed to the terms set forth therein.
 
1. On July 5, 1999, NationsBank, N.A. (""NationsBank"") changed its name to 
Bank of America, N.A.
2. On July 23, 1999, Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association 
(""BofA"") merged with Bank of America,  N.A. and the surviving bank is named 
Bank of America, National Association.

Effective July 23, 1999, as a result of the merger, the following will 
occurr:  

1. The ISDA Master Agreement, dated February 8, 1995,  between Enron Corp. 
and  and NationsBank, N.A.  will remain in place.  Bank of America, National 
Association as successor by merger, shall be our counterparty.

2. The ISDA Master Agreement, dated February 4, 1994 and effective as of 
August 14, 1992,  between Enron Corp. and Bank of America National Savings 
and Trust Association  is terminated.  Any existing trades under this 
agreement shall be transferred to the ISDA  Agreement under number 1 above.

 A copy of the letter agreement will be distributed.

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type.  Our Unify 
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting 
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like 
we did Southern Natural.  And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in 
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type 
manner.  We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production 
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the 
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't 
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the 
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream 
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify.  The pipe told me this is 
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area.  If it is 
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter 
the data twice today.  If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's 
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

Everything About Enron's Insurance Programs

That You Were Afraid To Ask

(or Didn't  Know to Ask)

Presented by
David Marshall
Enron Corporate Risk Management

Thursday, January 11, 2001
11:30 - 1:00

The Houston Room
601 Jefferson
(We've reserved the Enron Shuttle to transport the ""non-walkers"")

Lunch will be served.  Please RSVP to Pat Radford at 39282.

One of the goals of Jeff Hodge and Barbara Gray is to increase the level of 
departmental information sharing activities.  Since we are faced on a daily 
basis with insurance matters in contract drafting and client advising, the 
East/Upstream Origination and Trading Group felt it would be productive to 
have Enron's Corporate Risk Management Group give a presentation on current 
Enron Insurance Programs, policies and contractual risk allocation 
preferences.  It then occured to us that this subject might be of interest to 
all of the lawyers on the 38th floor.   Please join us next Thursday.   

Sorry for the inconvenient location.  We'll make it worth your while with the 
quality of the food and the presentation.

"John,

Tomorrow morning looks fairly open.  Pick a time.

I received your invoice for the Intergen deal.  There are some entries 
related to the GenPower issue that you and Michael took a look at.  Do you 
want to re-issue, or shall I just have it short paid?"
"no but whe will be out numbered by ut fans

Subject: Re: Global Confirm for Weather  

Due to the timing differences I had a crack at including these changes.   

Attached is an amended confirmation. The only change I was not sure about was 
tightening up the temperature definition. Do you mean moving to greater 
precision in rounding? No problem but we are following the UK approach. 

I would be most interested in any comments Paul would have. By way of 
background I consulted the London office on their rounding conventions for 
Celsuis.

Subject: Global Confirm for Weather  

Dear David,

Thanks to you for your prompt attention and to Jerven for finding Christian's 
corrected document.

Nick has commenced the process to put a global confirm which can be used 
woeldwide by Enron for weather derivatives, 
He has contacted Paul Simons , ex Clifford Chance , ISDA board member, and 
SFC compliance officer to kick off.

In the meantime, we will use the document below { CDD 13-04-00.doc }
but changes will still be further required - sorry :o(  

A.
Payment Date(s)

want to say that final payment from any adjustment is no later than 20 biz 
days after end of 95 days.
Avoids continual payments if temp is revised frequently in the 95 days.


B.
in Floating amount for 
time, and tighter defn of temperature
and base temp is 18

C.
Data Sources
I want to make the Final payment dependent not on website ( because website 
is not updated when a correction occurs)
but rather the final
Data Source is  ""daily temp and climate archive"" of the National
climate centre ( NCC) of BoM

Do you want me to type up changes for you to peruse or shall i chase up 
directly with Sara ?
Who OKs the wording of the confirm. ?


Thx, Raymond
13 April

Paul,
as per my voicemail - here is a draft confirm for weather - on the deems ISDA 
basis preparred by the guys downunder. Would like you professional input to 
help them with an interimsolution on this contract.

Further down the line (and this should also be encompassed in the web stuff) 
we need to have alegal group that works toward producing a master contract 
confirm that can be used for all Weather deriv structures and used in a 
global marketplace.  Just a quick job for a supremo like you!!! 

I'll talk to you on Monday when I get back into London about the politics!!!

have a great weekend

Subject: CDD Confirmation

Raymond attached is the CDD confirmation form. I have gone through the 
comments on the draft Jerven gave me. The only change I made is the inclusion 
of a weather station number in addition to a name. There was a question mark 
next to the website reference and a comment that there is no quality control 
for public access. Is the website reference OK?

Sara this confirmation follows the ENA model. The changes  only relate to the 
differing measurement references. We also included a  paragraph 5 to further 
reduce the possibility of the trade being characterised as insurance. If ENA 
is the counterparty then it should be enough to reference the relevant ISDA 
Master Agreement and change the references to EAF to ENA.

"Mark:

I'm getting calls from different people with AA requesting copies of all ""legally approved"" confirmation templates.  I've had requests today from two different people with respect to power and rate/FX.  Do we have a formal process for  approving templates?  Where are the templates kept and how does legal know if they have been changed?   Have similar requests been made for other products?  There does not seem to be any sort of AA uniform deadline for submitting the templates.

I've asked AA to advise you so that we can all be consistent in our responses.  

Thanks.  Sara

		 Subject: El Paso Merchant Comments on Reporting Requirements

El Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements 
docket.  They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, 
but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be 
gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial 
market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso 
suggests the following information be collected:
the name of the counter party to the financial trade
the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade
all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu
the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates
the date on which the deal was entered into
the type of trade

El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for 
the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in 
California in balance.)

I have a fax of the comments, but do not yet have them electronically.  Let 
me know if you want a copy faxed.

"Doesn't this constitute a change in Edison's position, i.e., I thought they'd indicated that everyone would be paid by end of Q1'03.  Now it appears they're saying that suppliers will get paid by year-end '03.  Am I missing something?  Thanks for the info.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: ML Power Group-EIX-Update Following Meeting With Management


* We met with Edison management on Friday (10/12) to discuss the recently
announced settlement agreement between the company and the CPUC.  The
agreement, which was approved by Judge Lew on 10/5, provides a framework for
Edison to repay creditors on a Q1 2002 time frame and, ultimately, to resume
power procurement responsibilities.
* Edison?s current estimate is that past power procurement debts will be
recovered by year-end 2003.  Discussions are ongoing with banks regarding a
bridge loan, which is key in terms of getting creditors paid on time.
* Negotiations with the renewable QF generators continue with both sides
apparently seeking a fixed-price contract.  The main issue is likely to be
timing of the switch to a new pricing formula, particularly as there will
likely be a substantial increase over current payments indexed to gas
prices.
* Regarding other generator creditors, Edison will be pursuing a negotiated
settlement.  One key date in this process is March 31, 2002, after which
Edison is committed to join the state and the CPUC in pursuing legal action
to recover alleged generator overcharges.
* One option is a so-called ?grand agreement? under which Edison would agree
on the starting amount owed to each generator.  This would potentially
release Edison to negotiate with the individual generators directly, as
opposed to through the PX/ISO.
* Edison expects to provide more detail of its earnings outlook within a few
weeks ? but probably not in time for the Q3 results release though.
* Several key accounting issues need to be resolved first, notably whether
or not the PROACT (Procurement Related Obligations Account) will be set up
as a regulatory asset.  Another key issue outstanding is the utility
retained generation (URG) rate proceeding currently under way at the CPUC.
* Given the above uncertainties, it is still difficult to be precise about
the earnings impact of the Edison settlement.  For the time being we are
sticking with our 2002E of $1.60, comprising $1.40 from the utility and
$0.20 for the non-regulated businesses and parent.  There is potential
upside to our numbers, particularly if previous tax sharing arrangements are
restored under the terms of the settlement agreement.
* Edison is trading at 9.6x our 2002E, only modestly below the group average
multiple.  We see only modest upside from here at this stage, although
clarity on the non-regulated outlook is a potential positive catalyst."

SHOPPING AROUND THE WEB

Electronic commerce is still so young that teething troubles were
only to be expected. But just watch it grow, argues our survey:
http://www.economist.com/l.cgi?f=20000226/index_su7636

Where e-commerce wins hands down, and where it doesn't:
http://www.economist.com/l.cgi?f=20000226/index_su6868

There may be room online for established firms and for virtual newcomers.
But which ones?
http://www.economist.com/l.cgi?f=20000226/index_su3796

Amazon's amazing ambition:

Can the web merchants deliver the goods?

Everything has its price. The web can help you find out what it is:

Before e-commerce can go global, it needs to overcome a few tiresome
obstacles:

Sally, 
In answer to your question regarding the approval process for sign on 
bonuses, Sheila Walton informed me of the following. 
If you are primarily in agreement regarding a small sign on bonus award,  
then no further approval process is necessary.     If the sign on bonus 
amount is substantial then approval from David Oxley is advisable.   
In our current case, a $5,000.00 sign on for a Sr. Specialist would not 
require additional approval except your own.   
I will continue to monitor sign on bonus offers and provide you with a 
recommendation based on all available factors.

"Poll thus far:
Aron Thomas (AES) just decided not to file.  He made the decision after 
talking to Edison, who told him that Edison is going to suggest in its filing 
that the surcharge be applied--get this--to the PX credit; thus, ESPs would 
pay, but then get it back through the credit (can you say ""poor quality 
receivables""?).  Aron feels that the issue should be figured out in work 
shops and the Commission should not decide it in the policy phase.
Bill Booth (CLECA) is going to remain silent on the issue because he doesn't 
know what the position of his members is.
Keith McCrae (CMA) is going to say that 1) the surcharge should not apply to 
direct acces customers and 2) the governor stated publicly that he supports 
direct access.

Jeanne's checking with the Industrial Users Group to see what they're going 
to say.  Since CMA is going to ask for clarification, I would suggest that we 
remain silent and focus on the other rate design/cost allocation issues, 
e.g., equity, no cross subsidies.  

Thoughts?

I let you know what I hear back from Jeanne.

Best,
Jeff"

Subject: Warm Fuzzies from B.W.

these are neat.
regards.  scott.

FIVE GREAT LESSONS:

1 -   Most Important Lesson - During my second month of nursing school, our 
professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed 
through the questions,until I read the last one: ""What is the first name of 
the woman who cleans the school?"" Surely this was some kind of joke. I had 
seen the cleaning woman several times.  She was tall, dark-haired and in her 
50s, but how would I know her name?  I handed in my paper, leaving the last 
question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last 
question would count toward our quiz grade. ""Absolutely,"" said the professor. 
""In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They 
deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say 
'hello'."" ""I've never forgotten that lesson.  I also learned her name was 
Dorothy.

2 - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain. One night, at 11:30 PM, an 
older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway 
trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had broken down and she 
desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next 
car.  A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those 
conflict-filled 1960s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance 
and put her into a taxi cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down 
his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's 
door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A 
special note was attached. It read: ""Thank you so much for assisting me on 
the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my
clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able 
to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away.  God 
bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others."" Sincerely, Mrs. Nat 
King  Cole.

3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve. In the days 
when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel 
coffee shop and sat at a table.  A waitress put a glass of water in front of 
him.
""How much is an ice cream sundae?"" he asked. ""Fifty cents,"" replied the 
waitress. The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the 
coins in it. ""Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?"" he inquired. By 
now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing 
impatient. ""Thirty-five cents,"" she brusquely replied."" The little boy again 
counted his coins.  ""I'll have the plain ice cream,"" he said.  The waitress 
brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy 
finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came 
back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly 
beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies - You see, he 
couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a 
tip.

4 -  Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path. In ancient times, a 
King had a boulder placed on a roadway. then he hid himself and watched to 
see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest 
merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.  Many loudly 
blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about 
getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along carrying a load 
of vegetables. Upon
approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move 
the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he 
finally succeeded.  After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he 
noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse 
contained many gold coins and a note from the king  indicating that the gold 
was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant 
learned what many of us never understand. Every obstacle presents an 
opportunity to improve our condition. 

5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts. Many years ago, when I 
worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz 
who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her only chance of 
recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who 
had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies 
needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained the situation to her 
little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his 
blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a 
deep breath and saying, ""Yes, I'll do it if it will save her."" As the 
transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we 
all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew pale 
and his smile  faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling 
voice, ""Will I start to die right away?"" Being young, the little boy had 
misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister 
all of his blood in order to save her. You see, after all, understanding and 
attitude, are everything.

Subject: Anglers


Hello ladies.

I have the signed original (all parnters have signed) of the going out of
business documents for Anglers.  What is next?

Honey, Kay seems to think there is one more form of some kind, plus a filing
fee.  What do you know about those items?  I'm ready to make a final
distribution and let you close out the account.  I'll be happy to deliver
these papers to whomever is the appropriate person, agencey, etc. and help
in any way to stop the insanity.
Can we obtain the final cost for filing the papers, keep that in cash and
make the final checks out?

My Anglers papers show the following percentages, just in case you've gotten
rid of your files:

Alves         21.775
Ashworth        4.265
Bailey         10.895
Dill         10.895
Lockwood      15.235
Mann           4.265
Napoli         10.895
Turner         21.775

And......Kay, before you start making some smart ...comments,  I don't need
the money and in fact I'll buy the first and last bottle of Krug if we can
get together for a final distribution ceremony.

As I always tell Dill (a.k.a. Mokhtar, his new Egyptian
nickname).......Praise Allah.

Ron:

I added to your spreadsheet the valuation of the combined Peregrine and Shortfall restrictions using an approach that Vassant and I discussed yesterday. 
It assumes: 
	1) Below $50.00 Shortfall will have restrictions on the whole number of shares (18MM shares); 
	2) Above $76.00 Peregrine will be fully rstricted.
	3) Between $50.00 and $76.00 Peregrine will bear a restriction proportional to (S-50)/(76-50) on 18MM shares and 
	   the Shorfall takes the restriction on the remaining shares.
Let's fix some time today to discuss the approach and results.

Let's meet in the morning and discuss the LOI.

Kay,

To briefly answer your questions, we are contemplating another layer of 
documents with the EPC contract.  There will also be a Development Agreement 
that outlines our development activities and our nonrefundable fee.  I don't 
read his comments to mean he only wants one EPC contract.  Let's discuss 
tomorrow.  Also, we've told Bob Wright that if the plants don't work, the 
state gets its money back.  I think he and everyone involved would be 
amenable to a performance band provided that a comparable reduction in price 
accompanies the reduced performance (to the 10 percent floor, of course).  
This LOI outlines the EPC contracts only.  The Development Agreement will 
cover our fee.  So, no, our fee is not at risk for the fuel cells failing to 
perform.  We will have some risk on BOP if the plants fail.

What time works for everybody?  How about 9:30?

Heather

Subject: CRRA LOI

Hi guys,

In looking at CRRA's comments to the draft LOI. I have these questions:

1.  I'm not sure what we mean by EPC contract.  Is this referring to the Fuel 
Cell document we are working now, or is there to be another layer? I know 
this may depend on whether CRRA or someone else is doing the balance of the 
construction activities.

2.  He expects one EPC contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple 
contracts. Does anyone care?

3.  Does CRRA get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail 
the performance tests?  We have discussed with FCE the concept of a 
proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full 
reduction as to the failing unit(s) only.  Also, are we planning to mark up 
the fuel cell contract to recover our fee?  Is our fee at risk for the fuel 
cells failing to perform? 

Thanks,

Kay

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

""Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure,"" Wolfman said in her letter. ""The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures.""=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

""As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO,"" a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. ""This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated.""=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

""The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment,"" the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as ""out-o=
f-market"" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =

Subject: Maine retail license for EPMI

Here are comments on the draft:

12.  ""Location, if any, of any office available to the general public or 
Maine customers:""  The draft says ""N/A"".  Shouldn't we put in Houston 
office?  Dan A's office?

13.  Customer rep. --Ramona in Dublin is EES customer rep.  Who will be ENA's?

15.  Should EPMI's response be limited to supplied RETAIL electricity in 
these jurisdictions?  Otherwise, all 48 states should be listed for EPMI.  
Also, the current EES sales in NEPOOL (New Hampshire and Rhode Island, I 
think) are made by EPMI.  There was/is also a retail sale in the MAPP area by 
EPMI, I think.

21.  EES' response is not exactly true with regard to EPMI, since it has been 
involved in civil legal actions.  However, does this really request any civil 
cases?  Can we answer by saying ""no enforcement proceedings by any state in 
which EPMI is providing retail sales of electricity?"" 

Tom, The application says ""Q"" is attached as other supporting material, but I 
can't find Q.  Also, you marked the Annual Electric Utility Report for 1998 
as ""A"", but I am not sure where it should go (""A"" is already answered.)

Thanks for the information.

Good Morning! Yes, that's the big girls. But, she's not as tall as the 
picture makes her look. The player standing right behind her is only 5 feet
tall. Some of the other girls are only about my height. There's a reason why
we encourage her to play softball and not volleyball. If genetics means
anything, I think her build will be more along the softball player lines! It
may also be the angle the picture was taken.

I think Annie is probably getting close to 5 feet tall, but I wouldn't swear
on it. Probably 4'10"" or so.

Have a good morning!

Love you!

talk to you and the group further about this because there are risks

info is info that we fill in based on our internal knowledge.  I'm out

"That's the right story.  Only thing I'd be prepared for is the following, 
""OK, Mr. Belden, California's stupid, they did it wrong, and your company 
told them so right at the outset.  Does that give you the right to rob 
California's consumers and businesses blind?""  

Regarding the story with Peace quoted saying ""we exported our stranded costs 
out of state.""  I recall seeing that story on several occasions.  Karen, do 
we have someone who can do a search (lexis/nexis) and find those articles?  
Shouldn't be too tough.

I am giving a speech in Santa Fe in a couple of weeks.  One of the points 
that I want to make is that California set up the rules, made a strategic bet 
to go short, decided to buy all of their power on the spot market, and is now 
crying that their massive bet didn't work.  I remember reading an article in 
the San Diego Tribune from sometime in 1998 or 1999 with a quote from Steve 
Peace.  Peace talked about how the state of California ripped off a bunch of 
dumb out of state generators and wisely solved their stranded cost problem.  
Does anybody remember this article?  Does anybody have this article?  Is 
there a service that we can use to find it if we don't have it?  Let me know.

Subject: OPEC: Arguing over Output - CERA Alert




**********************************************************************
CERA Alert: Sent Tue, July 18, 2000
**********************************************************************

Title: OPEC: Arguing over Output
Author: World Oil Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: World Oil ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5166&m=1275 ,

Saudi Arabia's announcement earlier this month that it would increase oil 
production by an additional 0.5 million barrels per day (mbd) if prices 
remained high ignited a firestorm within OPEC.* The announcement was 
upsetting to fellow OPEC members because

* it was a unilateral statement with no advance consultation

* most observers perceived Saudi Arabia to be acceding to US pressure

* it came on the heels of the June 21 OPEC meeting where a 0.7 mbd production 
increase was adopted with some difficulty

* it seemed to contradict an expressed Saudi view that the oil market was 
fundamentally balanced and that only structural and psychological factors 
were distorting prices

Subsequent to the furor it raised, Saudi Arabia backed away from promptly 
implementing a production increase and sought instead to develop an OPEC 
consensus in favor of higher output.

Saudi Arabia's thwarted initiative has now become enmeshed in the production 
adjustment mechanism advocated over the past year by Venezuelan Oil Minister 
and current OPEC President Ali Rodriguez. Having refrained at the March OPEC 
meeting from accepting the Rodriguez adjustment formula to add or withhold 
0.5 mbd of oil whenever the price of the OPEC crude basket is above or below 
$22-28 per barrel for 20 consecutive working days, Saudi Arabia has sought to 
justify an increase now on the basis of a sustained OPEC basket price above 
$28 per barrel. The market, however, has moved in opposition to the various 
OPEC signals, causing the basket price to fall below $28 on July 17, short of 
the 20-day period. Iran--which adamantly opposes a production increase since 
it is operating at capacity and would see its oil revenue decline--has led 
the opposition to the Saudi initiative and is insisting that the conditions 
specified by the Rodriguez formula have not been met.

The oil market continues to react to contradictory statements by OPEC member 
spokesmen, and on July 18 prices for WTI settled up $1.11 at $31.90 per 
barrel and prices for Brent increased $0.76 to $29.72. This increase was in 
reaction to an OPEC signal that it intends to restart the 20-day price period 
which could delay OPEC action on a production increase by at least four weeks.

Uncertainty about an OPEC production increase is the key factor supporting 
prices. This, in turn, leads to continued pressure on OPEC to implement a 0.5 
mbd production increase. The ""20 consecutive day"" mechanism is not, however, 
a final arbiter of OPEC production policy. For OPEC members who are amenable 
to the Saudi view on production, the mechanism is more likely to be used as a 
rough gauge of the global market and not as an automatic trigger to implement 
or--as the case may be--to delay a supply increase. In addition, the Saudis 
are capable of acting on their own in the old-fashioned way--quietly further 
increasing output above their quota. More OPEC gyrations are 
coming--including the Secretary General's impending visit to Caracas--but, 
unless the market settles beneath OPEC's upper limit soon, we expect that 
some additional OPEC oil will be produced, however the increase may be 
justified.

""The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has 
advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting 
program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current 
contracts.

This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed 
with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each 
Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for 
monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.

In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small 
businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead 
costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.

We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is 
currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, 
small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone 
business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available.""

Quick question.  Does the lease-buy-back free up $50M of funds for 1987?

Since Scott Neal's phone call with the counterparty was July 23 I believe 
that should be the correct date.  The call made by Julian and Federico on 
July 20 was not effective to bind ECT.  Please confirm this with Sara and 
Scott and make sure everyone is on board with this.  I am sure Scott was just 
using the draft deal ticket Julian prepared and Julian used the date they 
called rather than the date that Scott did the deal.

Brent,

One last question on the Central Puerto S.A. doc.  We currently have the 
Trade Date as July 23, but the tickets we received say July 20th.  Is July 
20th correct?  

Thanks,

Dear Mr Kaminski

I am delighted to say that the printed conference brochure is now available 
and our logistics team will be mailing them out, along with the speaker 
guideline packs (including information on hotel discounts etc), in the next 
couple of weeks. You will also no doubt receive copies via our main mailing 
campaign.

In the interim, please find attached a shortened pdf copy of the conference 
brochure for your perusal. (I did not want to send you the complete 12 pages 
as it would clog up your email!) The full colour version can be found on our 
website at www.icbi.uk.com/powerisk

I hope you agree that the speaker plenum and line-up of topics is possibly 
one of the best ever and not surprisingly the event is already drawing strong 
international interest. In particular the Executive Summit Day on e-Business 
and Power Trading is taking numerous bookings. I would be happy for you to 
attend either the Summit Day or one of our two intensive post conference 
workshops, but in order to avoid overcrowding on the day ask that all 
reservations be made in advance.

I am certain that you have friends or colleagues who would be interested in 
attending the conference this year, and would like to ask that you email the 
enclosed details to them. To make things easy, I have attached a booking form 
which should be faxed to +44 20 7915 5101. ICBI would be happy to offer a 10% 
discount on registrations received through speaker recommendations.

Finally for any enquiries relating to travel or hotel matters please contact 
our logistics manager Clare Capel on +44 20 7915 5198. Of course for any 
programme related issues, please drop me an email or call me on +44 20 7915 
5194.

I look forward to seeing you in October for what promises to be excellent and 
informative week.

Attached are approvals for January 12, 2001.  You'll note that several 
amended counterparties appear; in these cases ONLY THE CELLS HIGHLIGHTED IN 
YELLOW should be changed within the user profile for a given counterparty.  
Hopefully this will save some time both for credit as well as for product 
control.  As in the past, counterparties who are declined are crossed out 
across the profile.  New counterparties are highlighted as necessary.  

Please call if you have any questions; thanks.

Subject: Certificates and Resolutions





Gentlemen:

We have enclosed drafts of the following documents:

1.  Resolutions of sole member of Salmon Energy LLC authorizing the turbine
acquisition and related documents;
2.  Incumbency Certificate of ENA for the escrow agent; and
3.  Incumbency Certificate of PPL for the escrow agent.

The resolutions authorize the turbine contract, the loan from PPL, and the
G/E consent and agreement.  I have also drafted resolutions to be dated the
day following closing to elect as directors the persons named in the Amended
and Restated LLC Agreement (need the names of these persons - three
designees of PPL and one designee of ENA) and to replace the officers of the
LLC with persons designated by PPL.  If the lender desires Salmon
resolutions authorizing a security agreement to be signed by Salmon, we
would recommend that the new Salmon board controlled by PPL sign resolutions
ratifying and approving the security agreement, rather than have ENA approve
a security agreement that it has not negotiated and is not familiar with.

From a timing standpoint, we need to focus on the documentation required to
set up the escrow account, as I understand that the escrow may be funded on
the same day as the financial closing, namely, Thursday, April 19.  Citibank
will need (I) the escrow agreement, (ii) an incumbency certificate from each
party to the escrow agreement, (iii) a W-9 signed by each non-corporate
party to the escrow agreement, and (iv) a signed fee agreement.  The
incumbency certificates are enclosed.  Please insert names and other
information as appropriate.  We need comments to the Escrow Agreement in as
soon as possible in order that we can provide these documents to Citibank
for approval.

Thank you.

Pan Canadian Energy Services has the following request:

For all EOL traded deals they do not want to recieve the Annex A that is 
attached to our Omnibus-EOL templates.  They claim that since they have 
already signed off on the GTC in order to trade on EOL, then they do not want 
to repeat any work and have to review an additional GTC when we send them a 
Confirmation.  Is it possible to exclude any Annex A (GTC) when we send an 
Omnibus Confirmation for trades done on EOL?

Legal contact @ PanCanadian is Rick Tucker @ 713-331-5049

Thanks,
Joe

work.  I thought that this was going to be corrected last week.  I am 
confused about why we are using a system that does not work.  I understand 
that there are bugs in the system.  Was the system tested before being put 
into production?  

I tried to reach you by phone.  You were unavailable and I could not leave a 
voice mail because that was full.  I talked with Torey Hayden and verbally 
okayed the access for Bob Hall.  

Please call me and let me know when the system will be working correctly and 
how you are going to manage these approvals in the interim while the system 
is not functioning.  You might at least put a contact name and number on 
these things if you are going to continue to send these out before the system

? The legislature will meet and vote to repeal Section 390 of AB 1890.  This 
will reverse what the QFs get  paid from natural gas costs and replace it 
with the formula in the governor's current plan - 7.9 cents/kwh for 5-year 
contracts and 6.9 cents/kwh for 10-year  contracts.  According to sources, 
this is ""locked in to pass.""  It  will be implemented by a PUC order on 
Monday.
 
? The QFs met on this plan all day yesterday and have calculated what they 
would get paid.   This  plan would not generate enough money for many QFs to 
operate profitably.  At  least 2,000 MW of the total 5,407 MW of gas-fired 
QFs would be unable to generate  a positive cash flow and would have to 
either operate unprofitably or shut down.
 
? The QF community is responding with an increased militancy for an 
involuntary filing, according to sources.  The most aggressive QF after Coram 
Energy is David Sokol and Walter Scott of Mid-America Energy (based in 
Nebraska).  Sokol is described  by sources as ""extremely aggressive."" 
 
? An involuntary bankruptcy filing appears imminent.   Sources believes the 
trigger event will either be the legislative passage of the plan  tomorrow or 
the PUC order implementing the plan on Monday.

		 Subject: Proposed Changes Based on California Energy Shortages

Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading 
contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in 
California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit 
and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any "" 
future California"", we propose the following changes:

1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All 
Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading 
contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a 
major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to 
have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best 
advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.

2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple 
Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have 
multiple masters with a counterparty, a ""bridge"" should be put place between 
the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or 
more masters.

3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging 
EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient 
from both a credit and legal point of view.

4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- 

Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts 
or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes 
will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity 
to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve 
Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is 
conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity 
and a single or limited number standardized agreements.

"Chris,

We won't have any site specific technical info, so we will  have to fly 
without it.  I know that seems strange, but there is no designated site for 
this equipment as of now.

Here's co#1:



Each of these units has one dual fuel option.

The master list of serial numbers is in this document:




We use the unit serial numbers as opposed to turbine or generator serial 
numbers.  I'm sending you the whole enchilada since this is a handy reference.

I agree with adding 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option to the January 
payment.  Unit 17  to company 1 is fine.  The maximum liability price (or 
whatever we call it) will be the base price allocation, plus the dual fuel 
option amount.

Good question on the retention.  I guess we should set it up as if each is in 
a stand alone project. As far as I know they may be intending to put these at 
separate sites.

I'll get back to you on the fax and contract reference number.

Thanks,

Kay

Here's a revised draft incorporating your two suggestions:



I've forwarded what I have on the CO (#3) for South America to their lawyer, 
so I hope it will be wrapped up soon.

I've seen reference to the Pleasanton CO, and I know it is in the works as

Do you have the electronic file for the LV CoGen change order (#4), extending

I'll be in on Monday, although I have a heavy conference call schedule.  I'll 
be easiest to catch towards the end of the day.

		 Subject: The Answer Is:  To CLEC!

Hello Everyone,

We've gotten word back from Jim Fallon to go forward with obtaining CLEC 
licenses.  This brings us to the next set of questions:

Which entity do we license?  EBS or ETI?
If we license ETI as a CLEC, can we transfer EBS' IXC licenses to ETI?
Do we get CLEC licenses in all states, or some strategic subset of states?

I'd like to put together a group to address these questions, working with 
legal, tax, and commercial people.  Please let me know if you are interested 
in participating in this group.  It most likely will involve a fairly 
intensive schedule of meetings in Houston during December.

We should hold off on filing new IXC license applications until we have 
resolved the EBS vs. ETI issue.  For states where an EBS IXC license 
application currently is pending, let's not be too aggressive in pushing 
those applications forward over the next month.  Give me a call if this 
creates a problem in any of your states.  Also, Scott, please let everyone 
know if there are any fiber-build states where you think the delay would be a 
problem.

Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Sue

"Jeff Dasovich and I, along with several IEP members, met with Gov Davis'=20
staff today, including his Chief of Staff, his Staff Director and two polic=
y=20
advisors on energy issues.  They made the following points:

The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20
issues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well).
The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage, but=
=20
they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls=

a big part of the problem is a ""dysfunctional market"" -- a thinly veiled=20

The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20

Everyone must ""share the pain"".
The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20

While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the=

fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.

The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of=

about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmissi=

agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.

The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis=

Subject: US Gas Markets Reach New Heights: Where Will It Stop? - CERA Alert




**********************************************************************
CERA Alert: Sent Thu, June 01, 2000
**********************************************************************

Title: US Gas Markets Reach New Heights: Where Will It Stop?
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5166&m=1221 ,

The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level 
since deregulation. At the Henry Hub prices have surged to between $4.30 and 
$4.40 per million British thermal units (MMBtu)--up from less than $3.00 per 
MMBtu in April. Behind this has been a building and serious shortfall of 
supply, the result of disappointing gas production levels and surging gas 
demand for power generation. The gap between these two forces has been met 
through storage inventories, with injections so far this spring running 
between 1.5 and 2.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day below last year's pace.

The weak injection rate so far this season reinforces the pressure--last 
week's injections of only 8.0 Bcf per day compare with last May's injections 
of over 10.0 Bcf per day. If this trend were to continue throughout the 
summer, gas inventory levels would not meet minimum acceptable levels for 
next winter's heating season, which CERA believes to be between 2.65 and 2.7 
trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of working gas in storage by October 31. Indeed, 
injections for June to October must ramp up to an average of 8.1 Bcf per day, 
0.4 Bcf per day higher than last year's rate, for inventories to approach 2.7 
Tcf, a level that still exposes the market to shortage late next winter. Even 
reaching this level will be a challenge and will require that demand be 
priced out of the market. This growing realization has sent the market into a 
panic.

Although the forces that have pushed the gas market to this level are not a 
surprise--indeed they have been building for over a year--the resulting price 
level is shocking nonetheless. It highlights the challenge of pushing prices 
high enough to choke off demand and to free gas supplies for storage. Unlike 
years past, the gas market pressures this year come at a time when there is 
little flexibility in energy markets overall. Indeed, power markets are 
headed into the peak summer months with generation capacity still largely 
constrained in most markets; this is likely to result in a higher incremental 
call on gas than ever before--with only limited ability to switch to 
alternative fuels. At the same time oil prices remain above $30 per barrel, 
making the cost of switching particularly high. All these forces combine to 
suggest that the current market pressure is far from an aberration--and it 
raises the question: ""Where will it stop?""

There are breaking points in the market that are currently being tested--many 
of them involving industrial and feedstock uses of gas. Few of these 
currently cost below $4.00 per MMBtu, and many are currently above $5.00 per 
MMBtu. How high prices go and how long they stay there depends very much on 
the strength of the underlying market pressures. We expect to see the 
following reactions:

* Power generation: incremental gas-to-residual fuel oil switching. The 
Atlantic Coast dual-fuel market is already providing the first demand 
response to higher prices. Given the late May climb in gas prices relative to 
residual fuel oil prices, a significant portion of the 1.5 Bcf per day 
dual-fuel market has switched from burning gas earlier in the month to 
burning residual fuel oil. This summer, CERA expects virtually all 
logistically and environmentally feasible dual-coal load to burn residual 
fuel oil. This will result in an incremental 600 million cubic feet (MMcf) 
per day loss of gas demand from these plants relative to last summer (and 
relative to early May). However, to keep that load burning residual fuel oil, 
gas prices will have to sustain premiums of $0.05 to $0.25 per MMBtu above 1% 
residual fuel oil prices at New York Harbor to price out switchable capacity 
in the Northeast. Premiums to Gulf Coast residual fuel oil will be required 
to price out Florida and Mis!
sissippi/Alabama switchable capacity. Despite this fuel switching activity, 
CERA expects overall gas demand for power generation to climb by 3.0 Bcf per 
day from May into June as overall power demand increases.

* Reductions in ammonia production. CERA expects a loss in gas demand for 
ammonia production, even with the recent strength in ammonia pricing. Ammonia 
prices have softened somewhat from their highest levels of a few weeks ago, 
but were still at $165 per short ton over the past week. At these price 
levels, US ammonia margins began to disappear as gas moved above $4.00 per 
MMBtu at the Henry Hub. Given the strong gas prices, CERA expects a sustained 
period of negative ammonia margins. Last summer when ammonia margins 
disappeared, a sizeable portion of the North American ammonia production 
capacity closed; at its most extreme in August, gas demand for ammonia was 
down by 0.4 Bcf per day. This demand reduction is likely to be repeated for 
much of this summer. The closing of ammonia capacity should lend some support 
to ammonia prices. Last summer in response to ammonia closures, ammonia 
prices climbed by about $15 per short ton. This feedback effect would keep a 
tight balance on!
 price. For example, raising the ammonia price to $180 per short ton allows 
the industry on average to maintain a margin until the Henry Hub price 
reaches $4.50 per MMBtu. There are limits, of course. Ultimately, high gas 
prices will not shutter the entire domestic ammonia industry, which uses 
approximately 1.6 Bcf per day in fuel and feedstock.

* Ethane rejection. In previous gas price spikes or periods of low oil 
prices, processors have elected to leave ethane in the gas stream, providing 
an incremental source of gas supply. The observed difference in ethane 
production levels in recent years demonstrates a flexibility to add 
approximately 600 MMcf per day of gas supply, should extracting ethane from 
the gas stream become clearly unprofitable. Strength in oil and products 
markets this year, however, makes such an addition to gas supply highly 
unlikely. Last week (May 22-26) Mont Belvieu ethane priced above $5.50 per 
MMBtu (over $0.36 per gallon), with propane pricing over $0.54 per gallon. 
Given these products prices, gas prices of $5.00 in the Gulf Coast and $4.25 
in the Rockies would be required before processors leave significant 
quantities of ethane in the gas stream. In addition, propane, the major 
alternate to ethane in the petrochemical sector, is currently in short 
supply. The result is that until world oil!
 markets loosen, allowing imports of propane, ethane is likely to follow gas 
upward, should gas even reach the ethane price. Unless gas prices rise 
significantly from current levels, or until oil markets themselves weaken, 
CERA does not expect ethane rejection to add much to gas supply this summer.

* Methanol. Methanol margins are also suffering with current gas prices, even 
given recent healthy methanol prices. Methanol prices are being supported by 
the return of Asian demand; specific plant outages, including several ammonia 
feeder plants in Trinidad; and the late startup of several world-scale 
methanol plants, including plants in Trinidad, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. 
Although recent spot methanol prices have risen well above $0.60 per gallon, 
contract prices in the $0.50 range would imply production shutdowns when gas 
prices are above $4.00 per MMBtu. A significant portion of methanol plants 
having already shut down last summer, only a small incremental amount of gas 
demand is expected to be lost with further shutdowns in methanol production, 
perhaps 0.1 Bcf per day.

* Fuel switching to distillate. With distillate prices well above $5.00 per 
MMBtu, distillate is not expected to provide a major source of demand relief 
unless the pressure intensifies extensively and prices spike further. For 
next winter, however, fuel switching to distillate could become an important 
force taking the pressure off gas markets--particularly on the East Coast. 
That said, distillate inventories are currently low. To the extent this 
continues through the end of the year, it would set up a repeat of what 
occurred last winter in the Northeast when prices in both distillate and gas 
markets spiked.

In total there is certainly the potential to provide well in excess of 2.0 
Bcf per day of cushion through a combination of reduced consumption and some 
localized ethane rejection in the Rockies and eastern Gulf--plus a marginal 
increase in liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports (up to 0.1 MMcf per day). But 
currently such a reduction in consumption would require an even greater 
increase in prices. For now the gas market appears to have reached a very 
tenuous resistance point in the $4.25-$4.50 per MMBtu range--a level that 
should result in ""choking off"" an incremental 0.8 to 1.1 Bcf per day of gas 
demand (relative to two weeks ago) from the combination of additional fuel 
switching to residual fuel oil and reduced feedstock demand for gas (see 
Table 1). However, as we move through June and into July even slightly 
warmer-than-normal temperatures could add an additional 1.0 Bcf per day of 
highly inelastic demand for power generation (relative to normal weather) and 
force prices ev!
en higher to balance the market. CERA estimates that it would take prices in 
the $5.00 to $5.25 per MMBtu range to rationalize this extra 
demand--principally through a combination of ethane rejection and additional 
reductions in feedstock demand for gas. This deep a reduction inevitably 
would force price reactions in petrochemical markets--pushing gas prices up 
even further.

There are also limited forces that could drive the market lower--and remove 
some of the panic. Mild temperatures through June would provide the most 
significant impact by allowing more breathing room for storage injections. 
Any movement by OPEC to increase crude oil output could also help lower the 
fuel switching threshold points. But even if both these forces were to act, 
we estimate this would move gas prices back down only into the $3.50 to $4.00 
per MMBtu range. If prices fell any lower, demand would surge from a return 
of feedstock demand and fuel switching back to gas. For these reasons, CERA 
has raised its Henry Hub price outlook for the third quarter of 2000 to $4.18 
per MMBtu, and the average for the year to $3.67 per MMBtu.

Attached is a memo comparing the CEC's forecasted supply and a more realistic 
look at what additional resources might be available this summer.

The bottom line is that:

1.  The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this 
summer.  They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that 
expected outages will be around 3,000MW.  However, November and December saw 
significantly higher outage levels.  (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated 
these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed 
from running at higher than normal capacities.

2.  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected 
supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects.  It 
is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, 
if at all.  As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local 
communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units.  In addition, 
these units are likely to be uneconomical.

3.  In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or 
other generation units that are running up against their operating hour 
limitations from air quality regulations.  The Governor has ordered the local 
air quality districts to address these restrictions,  We are beginning to 
seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed 
standards.

4.  The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of 
the shortfall is still an unknown.  While there has been some relaxing of the 
limitations on run hours for back-up generation at ""essential public 
services"" the increase in DG is expected from ""clean"" sources, not diesel 
emergency generators.

5.  The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by 
this summer.  They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process 
and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for ""clean"" sources of 
generation in critical areas.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

"John:  The ""signature block"" for ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. trades done 
through the U.K. agent actually looks different.  It should read something 
like ""Company X, as agent for ENA"", for example.  Therefore, Insitnet needs 
to see the agency agreement between Company X and ENA (which is in the 
process of being drafted).  You are correct in that the original ENA/Instinet 
agreement will be utilized.  However, Instinet needs to review the agency 
arrangement before proceeding.

You are also correct about the ITG agreement.  In fact, ENA DOESN'T have an 
executed agreement with POSIT.  I spoke with the POSIT lawyer several months 
ago and was shocked that the service would operate without anything in 
writing.

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

As ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., will be the entities where all trades are 
actually booked, I would not think that any new agreements would need to be 
signed between the new ""agent"" entitiy and any outside vendors (ie, brokers, 
online trading platforms, etc.)  The new entity will never take actual 
ownership of the securities.  Therefore, I would presume that the Instinet 
agreement should just be an addendum to existing documentation.  The 
Posit/ITG agreement will have to be an entirely new agreement because the 
ownership structure of ITG Europe is different than that of the States.  This 
agreement, however, should reflect exactly the same sort of 
structure/language as was used to negotiate the contract between ITG and ENA 
and ECT Investments, Inc. 

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks and regards,
John

John:  Hi, there!  As you are aware of the structuring for tax purposes, 
until the U.K. corporate agent is actuallly formed, there is nothing further 
that I can do.  That formation should happen today or tomorrow.  With the 
actual name and agreements with ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., I can provide 
that information to Instinet and the other trading platforms you are

"Chris:
Thanks for your prompt response.  I think that we do need to register the

Does everyone at Enron agree?

Dear Carol

Under Bermuda law, there is no real concept of ""perfecting"" security since it 
is not necessary to ensure the enforceability in Bermuda that a charge be 
registered in Bermuda.  However, although it is not necessary for a security 
interest to be registered in order for it to be valid, the charge document 
itself can be registered in Bermuda in the Register of Charges in accordance 
with Section 55 of the Companies Act 1981 in order to ensure the priority in 
Bermuda of the charge.  On registration, any charge evidenced in the charging 
document will have priority over any unregistered competing charge or any 
subsequently registered competing charge in respect of the assets which are 
the subject of the charge (i.e. the cash).

If the agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law, it will be 
a matter of the laws of either Texas or New York as to the actual nature of 
the security interest which is created by the charge.

If you would like us to effect the registration of the charge, we would need

We have done a trade with a Bermuda hedge fund and have negotiated
collateral provisions that may require them to post csah to us.  The
agreement will be governed by either Texas or New York law.  We need your
advice on how to perfect our interest in any cash posted to us that we
would hold in an account in the United States.  Could you please call
either me or Sara Shackelton (713)853-5620 if possible tomorrow or you can
send me an e-mail if that is easier.  I'm hoping that our possession of the
cash is enough.  Sorry for the short fuse on this.  If you need any
additional information, please contact me or Sara.  I will be unavailable
from 9-11 and 2-3 tomorrow Houston time.

Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  The document you 
faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.  That document, 
TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full ""ISDA Master Agreement"".  
Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and 
proposed form of Legal Opinion to be issued by Clark County PUD #1.

It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the 
counterparty.  Again, the whole package above must be provided to the 
counterparty or you will not have a complete set of documents.  Call me if 
you have any questions.

Anyone who's been single and over the age of 18 can relate to this.

When I was younger I hated going to weddings ...it seemed that all of my

aunts and the grandmotherly types used to come up to me, poking me in the

ribs and cackling, telling me, 'You're next.'

? They stopped that crap after

I started doing the same thing to them at funerals.

"THE LEGISLATURE
No material change from the last update.  
The Legislature is in recess and the two bills that passed the Senate--SB 78 and SB 18--continue to sit in the Assembly, waiting for the Assembly to return on August 20th.
Support for the two bills in Assembly is currently very weak.
A handful of Democratic Assembly legislators and staff have been meeting over the recess to determine whether they can 1) reach agreement on the bill that the Assembly's been working on (AB 82), and 2) reach agreement with the Democrats in the Senate.
We will distribute the output of those meetings as soon as it is available.
The key features of SB 78 would: 
allow Edison to recover $2.5 of the $3.5 B of payables. 
earmark the $2.5 B to pay the banks and the QFs.  
leave Edison to figure out how to cover the remaining $1B in payables to suppliers (including Enron).
single out the largest business customers to pay for 100% of the $2.5 B in payables.
give the State the option to buy Edison's transmission assets at book.
do nothing to ensure Direct Access is maintained.
The key features of AB 82 would:
maintain a week form of Direct Access, though the bill doesn't go nearly far enough with respect to DA.
adopt some of SB 78's the onerous features (e.g., no authorization to pay back suppliers; force the biggest business customers to pay down Edison's debt to the banks and QFs).
The key features of SB 18 would:
restructure the way in which the upcoming bond issuance is financed by creating a ""dedicated utility rate component"" (i.e., a fixed charge) to service the bonds.
de-link payments to suppliers holding DWR contracts from payments to service the bonds to pay back the General Fund.
allow the PUC to hold a public hearing on DWR's contracts.

A consortium of small and large businesses and business associations sent a strongly worded letter today to Davis and all members of the CA Legislature expressing extreme opposition to both 78 and 82.  I have a copy of the letter and will distribute to anyone who would like to see it.
In the same letter, the business consortium strongly supports SB 18 because they fear they will get stuck with any out-of-the-money DWR contracts.
The consortium is lobbying hard to have the DWR contracts nullified or re-negotiated.
The Treasurer and the Governor oppose SB 18 because they believe 1) it would constitute contract breach, and 2) the contract provisions require the state to pay the present value of the contract plus LD in the event of a breach.
Calpine, who holds about 50% of the DWR contract volume, is also opposed to SB 18.
Opposition to any form of ""Edison bailout"" is increasing among policy makers, opinion leaders and the press
There is currently a 50-50 or better chance that the Legislature will NOT pass an Edison MOU before the session ends, though that could change.

THE CALIFORNIA PUC
Since the legislature has failed to pass comprehensive legislation addressing CA's crisis, the issues now revert back to the PUC.
In particular, the PUC is slated to rule on August 23rd on whether Direct Access should be suspended.
The Treasurer has said that DA must be suspended in order to remove any risk that DA might create with respect to impairing the revenue stream necessary to service the bonds.
AB 1X, the law that authorized DWR to buy power, gives the PUC the authority to suspend Direct Access.
Enron is leading a large group of customers and suppliers in an effort to stop the PUC from suspending Direct Access.
The group is writing a letter to Davis, the PUC, the Treasurer, DWR and the Legislature urging them to maintain Direct Access.
That letter should be released Friday or Monday.
The group is also making a submission to the PUC as early as Monday to provide the Commission with practical alternatives that would permit the the PUC to maintain Direct Access.
The group is also mounting a PR campaign that it wil launch simultaneously with the release of the letter and the submission to the PUC.
Currently, the chances that the PUC will suspend Direct Access on the 23rd is better than 50 percent, but a considerable effort is underway to reverse the situation.

Jeff"

		 To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT
		 cc: Janette Elbertson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sharon Crawford/CAL/ECT@ECT
		 Subject: New Canadian Lawyer

Janette - Can you call Sharon to co-ordinate 5-10 minutes when Mark is 
available to discuss the attached.

Mark -  I want to discuss with you a candidate, with the following background 
information.  Sorry for the long memo but it might make our discussion more 
efficient.

I wanted to see if I could recruit someone with 4-6 years major law firm 
experience and whom I knew or could confirm by my contacts as having a 
reputation as a quality lawyer and person with broad corporate and commercial 
experience.  Perhaps I am getting too far removed from that level, but I was 
able to come up with only one candidate that I think is worthy of pursuing.  
If he proves unsatisfactory, I will then have to go to an 
out-placement/recruitment agency, which is relatively expensive.  That said 
the candidate I am suggesting would to my mind be as good or better than any 
candidate that we may find through a formal recruitment process.  His name is 
Derek Flaman.  I will send his resume to you by fax.

A couple of points:

Strengths:

(a)  Derek comes from the Donahue Ernst and Young firm and to my knowledge is 
a highly regarded commercial associate.

(b)  Prior to that he was at Macleod Dixon and a highly regarded commercial 
associate there.  The Managing Partner of Donahue Ernst and Young Calgary 
came from Macleod Dixon Calgary and brought Derek over with him.

(c)  Derek has never done any work for us, but I have met him socially a 
number of times and have spoken to him about this job possibility.  I think 
he has a down-to-earth and comfortable personality that would suit the 
atmosphere and stresses of Enron well.

(d)  Derek was seconded internally to Husky Oil - one of DEY's major Calgary 
clients - for a period and has experince in-house.  He worked for an internal 
lawyer at Husky who is a friend of Greg Johnston and who gave excellent 
reviews.

(e)  Although I do not have his law school grades, he tells me he finished in 
the top third of his class at Queens University - which among the reputable 
schools in Canada.

(f)  He is qualified both under Alberta and Ontario law.

(g)  He has met with Milnthorp and Greg Johnston, both of whom were favorably 
impressed.

Issues:

(a)  Derek graduated from law school in '94 and since that time his career 
has been a bit traveled.  Although there is an explanation, his continuous 
experience at Macleod Dixon and Donahue Ernst and Young started in '97.  
Before that the history is he is from a small town in Alberta.  After 
graduating he wanted to work at a small firm in Toronto and had an interest 
in labor law, and spent his first year articling to a Toronto labor 
boutique.  After that year he wanted to get into commercial work and out 
Toronto, and moved to Fraser Milner in Edmonton.  His wife then took a 
position at Stikeman Elliott in Calgary however, and so he moved to Macleod 
Dixon in Calgary.  He moved to Donahue Ernst and Young when they established 
their office in Calgary.  All things being considered, I am comfortable with 
his experience at say a 4 to 5 year level - although compensation could then 
be an issue (I have not discussed compensation with him).

(b)  Derek's experience has been primarily in large commercial projects, 
especially the off-shore oil and gas developments in Hibernia and Terra Nova 
for Husky.  This would require some very good legal and large project 
organizational skills but is obviously different from a faster paced, 
commercially oriented, higher volume trading atmosphere.  In his secondment 
to Husky however he was more involved in their retail gasoline business and 
natural gas marketing and,  although I am sure not the atmosphere at Enron, 
he tells me it is an atmosphere he is comfortable with and enjoys.

(c)  Do Jim Derrick's accounting/law firm concerns apply to hiring a lawyer 
(as opposed to retaining counse)?

I would like to get back to Derek soon to discuss next steps (interview in 
Houston? with whom? Vicki Sharp? get a feel for compensation expectations?), 
or look to other alternatives.

Peter.

Here are my comments to the form of Guranty:

1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement.

2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M 
if the Guaranty only covers Engage US.

3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our 
rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that 
is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only 
be on the Guarantor's right to assign.

4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent.

5. For notice purposes to ENA please add the following:

Dear Sara & Cheryl,

I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
International, S.A. (""CISA""), to begin negotiations for
them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.

There had been some question as to which Enron entity
was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
office in London?) was that it should be Enron Capital
& Trade Resources International Corp.  FYI, Cargill
International, S.A. is located and incorporated in Geneva.

Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
get this ISDA started on Enron's part.

Thanks and Regards,

"Tom --

My comments on the legislation called the ""Electric Energy Regulatory 
Coordination and Reliability Act"" -

1. Why did we exclude the Federal power marketing administrations, TVA, 
etc.?  Are those facilities regulated in a different section?

2. Why do we limit the FERC's authority (on pg 8) from regulating 
""transmission in intrastate commerce""?  This is a loophole that could be 
abused by many parties.

3. I am very concerned about the ""independence"" language (pg 10).  Today NERC 
has an ""independent"" Board of Trustees that is elected by the Stakeholders.  
Would NERC meet this criteria?  If it would, then the lanaguage needs to be 
strenghthened.  

4. We should add something that authorizes the FERC to implement a 
""Reliability Standards Fee"" onto each Transmission Provider.  One of the key 
problems with NERC today is that the funding vehicle still resides with the 
Regional Councils and therefore with the IOUs.  The NERC Board of Trustees 
has no method to raise funds except to get approval of the Stakeholders.  
This will become the key problem very soon.  The total NERC budget is $12 MM 
/ year.  This is nothing if allowed into rates.

Thanks,

Jim

Subject: Litigation Counsel Approval - Lakeside Packers

We have a counterparty (Lakeside Packers) who refuses to perform to a 5 year 
fixed for floating power swap which commenced Jan. 01 and is C$2.5MM 
(US$1.7MM) in the money to us and booked (we would take a hit to earnings by 
that amount to unwind the deal).  Unfortunately, without the involvement of 
Legal, the deal was executed without paper, but on the basis that it was 
subject to our standard ISDA documentation.  The Confirm was sent out on that 
basis but not executed by the counterparty.  There was some agreement on 
guarantee support, but as this was less clear to get the underlying deal put 
in place, with the approval of Credit, we gave up the requirement for the 
guarantee in our subsequent discussions and demand letter.

We want to pursue the matter by commencing litigation.

Lakeside is traditionally represented by Blakes.

My suggestion would be to use the Duncan McCachen firm, a litigation boutique 
who we have used in the past (CIBC litigation).  Mike McCachen has a good 
understanding of the trading business for a litigation lawyer.  
Alternatively, I would suggest Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon who is 
currently representing us on the NGX litigation and who also has a good 
understanding of out trading business.  Mike is a little more aggressive than 
Clarke, to my preference.

We would like to proceed as soon as possible as our demand letter expired 
last week, and our calls this morning were not dealt with satisfactorily.

Peter.

Hi Vince,

I was wondering how the chapter of the book is coming along??! Do you want  me
to make 'noise' tomorrow or to leave you until after Easter?

Until then, I wanted to discuss with you an idea  that Les and I have been
throwing around concerning writing a series of articles  for Risk's 'Energy 
and
Power Risk Management'. We would like to propose to  them?that we would write 
an
article a month, covering practical issues  dealing with energy modelling and
energy derivative pricing and risk management.  The articles would be based 
upon
sections of the book so as to promote the book,  and to reduce the effort/time
involved by using?already produced material.  We would like to cover some very
practical topics, but we?won't be giving  too much away as the articles are 
only
1 or 2 pages long.

Each article would be of?the  form;

- introduce?the concept
- give an example using real data
- discuss the problem with a case study
- provide a discussion
- sum up

I've included a list of potential articles at the  end of this e-mail. For
example, for the first one,  ""Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy
prices"", we would introduce  the concept of mean reversion,?show a graph of an
equity index and an  energy price?for illustration of our point, estimate the
parameter for a  series of energies over a number of seasons, and finally,
discuss the  results.

We?are wondering if you would like to be  involved in this project? Your
involvement needn't take much time (although it  is up to you). The kind of
input we are hoping for (again, this is up to you) is  that you?would?review 
the
list of articles and  provide?suggestions of additions or deletions, suggest
reasonable data sets  or case studies to work with on each article, and then 
to
run your eye over  ""near finished"" articles, which?we would supply to you for
your?practical experience?input.? Would something like this  interest you? If 
it
did, we would try to sell Risk on making it a regular  monthly ""feature"" of
EPRM, authored by all three of us.

We are hoping to present our proposal to Risk in  the next few weeks, so 
please
let us know if you are interested.

Best regards.

Chris.


Potental EPRM articles;

1- Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy  prices (with parameters
estimated for oil, gas, and electricity data over  different seasons)

2- Estimation of jumps in spot energy prices (with  parameters estimated for
oil, gas, and electricity data over different  seasons)

3- Simulating a mean reverting spot price process  for pricing energy
derivatives (with case study applied to an Asian option on  oil)

4- Simulating a jump / diffusion spot price process  for pricing energy
derivatives (with case study applied to a Swaption on natural  gas)

5- Simulating a mean reverting jump / diffusion  spot price process for 
pricing
energy derivatives (with case study applied to  hourly caps on spot 
electricity)

6- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a mean reverting spot
price model (with example applied to a cap on natural  gas fitting the Forward
curve and volatlity structure)

7- using a tree consistent with the forward curve  and vols for pricing swing
options

8- implying a single?factor vol function from  market Futures option prices 
and
variation of parameters thru time

9- adding jump volatility to the tree

10- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a multi-factor forward
curve model(with example applied to the same cap on  natural gas and a
discussion on the differences between the two  approaches)

11- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve models 
(with
estimates of oil data over different  periods)

12- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve model from
market option prices

13- pricing swing option in multi factor model  using tree for exercise 
strategy

14- comparison of VaR methodoligies applied to the  same energy derivativ
portfolio.

		 Subject: Status report on Legislative Activity  Thursday, Jan 25

Assembly Committee held a hearing on ABX1-18  Hertzberg, the speaker's 
vehicle for allowing DWR to purchase power for the state and to use revenue 
bonds to payoff utility undercollections and to finance ongoing DWR operating 
costs.  We have forwarded by fax the latest version of this bill.    The 
Assembly Committee was only able to discuss three sections of the bill before 
adjourning until 1 pm tomorrow.  Chairman Wright expects to take the 
remainder of the afternoon tomorrow to go through the bill line by line and 
expects to only get part way.  He anticipates no hearings over the weekend 
and more hearings to follow Monday through Wednesday next week.  Thus no vote 
on the bill is expected for a while. In addition, all parties, including 
Wright expect amendments as a result of ongoing negotiations between the 
Governor, Speaker, the utilities and the generators.  These would center on 
the price the generators will bid and how much if anything the utilities will 
have to absorb of past undercollections.  There is no indication at the 
present of when they will show or what those amendments will say.

Initial analysis of the bill raises the following issues:

Most important issue   On pages 3 - 8 of the bill, new provisions are added 
to AB 1890 (Section 368 et al) to define how the TRA and TCBA are to be 
calculated and what the Commission must allow in rates.  These provisions 
appear unduly generous to the utilities and may well provoke an immediate end 
to the rate freeze if enacted.  Here are the main elements of the language.

368.2  The Legislature finds that it is appropriate to allow the utility to 
recover the reasonable costs incurred to purchase wholesale energy.  (that 
means the big under collection from summer 2000 to date)

368.3  New definitions of the ""adjusted TCBA"" and ""net undercollected 
amounts"" are provided which appear to provide for the following way of 
wrapping up transition cost ratemaking.

1.  The TCBA is the positive balance as of 12-31-00 increased by the trust 
transfer amounts to be recovered in rates for 2001, also increased by amounts 
included in retail rates for prior period costs (if any are authorized by the 
CPUC), and also increased by the balances in the generation memo accounts as 
of 12-31-00.  
2.  The new ""net  uncollected amount"" that the utilities could collect in 
rates would be the current TRA account, as reduced by the above defined 
balance in the TCBA as of 12-31-00.  

NOTE: Edison claims this is the same mechanism that Enron proposed to the 
Commission as an alternate to the TURN proposal.  It has similarities to the 
comments we filed Nov. 9, but our official position is still to support the 
from-the-begining netting of the two accounts as proposed by TURN.

3.  There is also language to lock in the CPUCs current ratemaking for these 
accounts so that the TURN proposal to net the TRA and TCBA cannot be 
implemented.

4.  The utilities'retained generation will be put in rate base at book value, 
except for the nukes, which will have their rate base calculated WITHOUT the 
application of overcollections in the transition cost balancing account to 
accelerate depreciation.

5.  The CPUC is supposed to establish a dedicated rate component within the 
existing rates as of 1-8-01 to allow recovery of the net undercollection (the 
large TRA undercollection as reduced per the above).  The undercollection is 
to be amortized over 10 years.

6.  The utilities will not have to buy power if their credit rating drops 
below BBB+.

The remainder of the bill has to do with the mechanism for the DWR to 
purchase power and to have revenue reduction bonds pay for costs in excess of 
those recovered in the utilities rates.  Rod Wright is seeking a ""stop 
loss""provision which will force a rate increase once the DWR has used up all 
its appropriation and all the bond revenues to buy power.  This is 
controversial with the other members.

We have been asked for a reaction by the committee members and would like a 
response ASAP, certainly by mid-day Friday.  This will require balancing the 
concerns about and early end to the rate freeze with the increased likelihood 
of payment for power transactions once DWR is funded.  The prospect of 
successful participation in more auctions is unclear unless more practical 
auction terms are used.  However, the auction process is not spelled out in 
this bill. The generators are supporting an early end to the freeze so that 
they can be paid...I  am in meetings starting early in the am so I will not 
be on the 10:30 call, please send comments to scott govenor..either by e mail 
or by fax, his fax is 9164480816.  I am also interested in how we should 
""message"" this.

"I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you 
know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources 
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to ""catch up"", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going 
basis.   

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS 
as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production 
support will be managed and how development work will be effectively 
handled.  

I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible.  "

Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
""You have to look at the whole picture,"" Maviglio said. 
""The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats,"" he said. ""Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. ""All the prices were high,"" he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the ""vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts."" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with ""moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy.""

Subject:=09DSM projects as real options  =20

Vince:

Could you spare a few moments to look over the attached three-page Power Po=
int presentation?  At a minimum, we're trying to demonstrate the following:=
  In high-volatility electricity environments, for those EES customers who =
employ their own capital, their usual capital-project IRR hurdles may be lo=
wered slightly in the special case of DSM projects, to allow for the extra =
value derived from reduced risk exposure stemming from reduced power consum=
ption/dependence.

I'm pushing the boundaries of real-option theory (and good sense) and viewi=
ng a DSM project as a series of options, the values of which are additive. =
 First is the option to engage in the DSM project itself; which, if we exer=
cise the option immediately, can be valued intrinsically through a simple N=
PV analysis.  Second is a strip of put options to generate ""negawatts,"" ext=
ending over the useful life of a DSM installation, the cumulative value of =
which is an extrinsic value associated with the DSM project.  These options=
 are exercised sequentially--over the life of the DSM installation--wheneve=
r the customer experiences a dramatic, stochastic spike in electricity pric=
e, associated with a lognormal price distribution.  I'm calling the value o=
f this strip a ""residual time value"" associated with the original DSM optio=
n.  If we can add this residual time value to the NPV and derive a total va=
lue that is quantitatively higher than a simple NPV alone,  we may be able =
to help the customer get more projects approved, even at the original high =
IRR hurdle.

Alternatively, and more feasibly, we'd like to give these same customers a =
""qualitative"" tool with which they can convince their finance gatekeepers t=
o lower--for DSM projects--their standard capital-project IRR hurdle .  The=
 attached presentation is a first attempt at this qualitative argument.

We intend to use this only as a sales and marketing tool, to allow at least=
 one of our customers who has an onerously high hurdle rate to manage aroun=
d his company's internal capital-budgeting requirements.  He has set aside =
a large sum of money for DSM projects, but will only be able to spend a sma=
ll portion of it under his company's current capital budgeting methodology,=
 which does not take into account forward commodity price volatility.

In your opinion, is there any hope in devising a quantitative justification=
, or will we have to stick with the qualitative argument as described in th=
e attached presentation?  In other words, is it possible to quantify ""resid=
ual time value"" as I've defined it above? Or, even better, are you aware of=
 a more practical way of conceptualizing this problem?

Thanks,

Jeff Gray

I will be on the first panel of the FERC California conference on Thursday.  
The format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.  I need your 
help to make sure I have ""Gore-like"" command of the details.  Please help 
with the following information:
Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any 
presentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we 
have under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are 
comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever 
information you have.
Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information 
was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking 
facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.
Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from 
the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would 
be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already 
approved.
Cancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel 
comfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of 
how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.
ISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is 
there another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of 
the PX report too.
CEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: 
proposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to 
expedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less 
than 10%)?
Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the ""soft"" nature of 
the cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it 
to say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting 
requirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than 
applying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears 
the market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?
Offers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus 
any others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market 
will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility 
(and the regulators) out of the merchant function.
Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be 
courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway 
credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else ""squishing"" on the 
price cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need 
these guys on board.
Thanks.

"I think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.

How do we convince customers to participate?
Two distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.

New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.

Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.


Issues:

Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts.
	Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate?
	Might make more sense where no current positions exist.
	
Contract hurdles:

	Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default.
	Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC.
	May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work).

If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?

It's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch.  (Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)

Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  

When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this.

Louise and John:

Here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with VMAC (Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation)-FSA (Financial Securities Assurance). FSA is an AAA rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal.  

Here are the deal highlights:

FSA would wrap Enron's credit exposure as follows:

1) In case of default FSA would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by Enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions.

2) In case Enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to VMAC. FSA would pay the counterparties with the 100% collateral previously posted by Enron and managed on a day to day basis.

FSA has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to Enron based on its net collateral position (~$1.3 billion as of today) and the net mark to market position (~ $1.4 billion to date). Haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant.

FSA-VMAC would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions. Under the current structure the only risk FSA- VMAC is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by Enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts. 

Please find enclosed the following:

1) Transaction structure : 	Describes the payment logic in case of default
2) Terms and conditions :	Describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contract
3) Collateral Haircuts : 		Describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to FSA to guarantee our net mark to market position (if out of the money)
4) FSA snapshot
5) FSA rating: 			AAA qualification of FSA by Moody's

Please feel free to contact me or Brad Richter to clarify any doubts with respect to this,

Mark,

Thanks for your note.  It's a common misconception that we will be mostly 
working on asset disposition.  Our focus will be on the efficient operation 
of the assets, cleaning up problems, finishing projects etc.  The sales 
efforts will be conducted through Cliff Baxter's group with support from us.  
So, I don't believe that  I will need the type of effort that you believe 
David can provide and I have no other need for him at this juncture.  Cliff 
may feel that he has the need for David.  By the way, my experience with 
David when he worked for APAChi was that he had not learned much about the 
business and therefore was not terribly helpful to us as we were 
restructuring the group or when we were in a build mode in Thailand.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Rebecca

With your new organisation, I expect that you will have issues that will 
require support from my team, covering everything outside the Americas (Rick 
Shapiro providing support in the Americas).  Any thoughts either of you have 
regarding what your requirements might be would be helpful.  My understanding 
is that a fair bit of your effort will be focussed on asset disposition.  If 
that is correct, I want to run one idea by you.  We still have David Merrill 
posted as an expat in Singapore.  He is not working out as support for EBS 
(totally new field to him).  What are your thoughts on David returning to the 
energy arena, and focussing on flying around, as appropriate, to meet with 
various governments, working to secure necessary approvals, as/when/if 
needed?  Seems to fit his skill sets, based on prior government experience 
that he has.  

A second person who could also fill this role, though he is looking at other 
opportunities within Enron and may not be available, is Mike Dahlke.  
Thoughts on this person for this role?

I have never used Moss Bluff, I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx.  I like Egan - it hooks up with ANR, Tex Gas, Tenn, CGLF, and Trunkline."

Subject: Re: Draft Agenda for 12/15/99 EEI/NEMA Contract Group Meeting



Athough I know that PECO had a variety of questions about the interplay
of the FERC transmission policies and the force majeure definition at
the Nov. 18 meeting, I think we should keep the Houston session focussed
on the Products definitions first, and only deal with the force majeure
definition as it relates to the other products definitions.  If PECO
wants to continue to explore the transmission points, or other FERC
policy points they no doubt will, but I don't think they go on the
agenda, and certainly not first.
I think it would be very important to attach current products
definitions to the agenda, and would therefore plead with Liz and Marty
to see if we can get those implemented and to Andy for distribution by
Friday.  Also, Mitch Dutton was the one with custody of the System Firm
definition, and I will call him today to see if he can get it massaged
and to Andy by Friday morning.
  I'd love to have a discussion, with traders present, about the
bookout issue, but I don't know if we'll have time.  The other ""global""
issue that the traders need to focus on (and will no doubt want an
update on) is the status of the efforts to get FERC on board.  Andy, can
we at least give them tentatively that we WILL meet with FERC staff in
January, and the tentative dates of the rollout sessions on the contract
in Houston and New York?  PD

>>> <HEMU@dynegy.com> Tuesday, December 07, 1999 >>>
Please take a look at this and give me your thoughts.  One area that I
believe
needs more work in particular is the item referring to FERC policies; I
think
this is PECO's issue, but I'm not sure what FERC policies they are
concerned
about.

I would like to attach the current definitions of the products to the
agenda.
Do we have a definition of the ""Into __"" product that has been updated
since the
November 9 conference call?  Is there a new defintion of the ""Firm
(LD-System
Reliability)"" product?

What about trying to tackle bookouts if we have the time?  Is there
any
conceivable way we will have the time?

Thanks,

"Power providers cry foul over fees 
State is accused of improper billing 
Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis' administration. 
The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. 
Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant. 
The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. 
""The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them,"" Smutney-Jones said. 
An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. 
The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. 
State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. 
Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to ""bury"" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. 
""The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO,"" Ackerman said. 
The governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusations ""absolutely false"" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs. 
""The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento,"" Maviglio said. ""It shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement."" 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis. 
""I don't feel sorry for them one bit,"" Hidalgo said. ""They had one heck of a year."" 
Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. 
Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. 
The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. 
Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. 
The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. Davis appointed his own five-member board. 
In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become ""a political arm of the governor."" The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization. 
Davis has warned Washington to ""keep its hands off"" the ISO. "
"Mara:  Are we done?  I don't think we have heard from you about the master?  
Can we go ahead and have the guaranty executed?  I don't think we have any 
outstanding issues.

Executive Summary:

? The as yet unnumbered rescue bill by Davis made it to the Senate floor
? An exemption of the gas-fired QFs from this bill (as proposed by Sen. 
Keeley) could further forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing.
? If passed, the draft CPUC order would give the utilities another 15 days 
after rate hikes to pay the QFs
? The negotiations with the QFs are complicated by the issue of payments owed 
by the utilities to the DWR. Senators are demanding that the utilities set up 
a trust fund from rate revenues to pay back the DWR. 
? The CalEnergy ruling (as reported by Bloomberg this PM) is an attractive 
option for other QFs looking to at least temporarily escape long-term supply 
contracts with Edison.
? If neither the CPUC nor the legislature exempts the gas-fired generators 
from the new rate structure, an immediate involuntary bankruptcy filing is 
expected.  However, if the exemption is implemented, then a bankruptcy filing 
would be delayed.

1. ""QF Bill"" Makes it to Senate Floor


The ""CPUC bill"" (the number is not yet known) is in mock-up form and does the 
following:

* Repeals PUC Code section 390, which set a formula for QFs under 
deregulation.
* Amends portions of AB 1X which will ensure that DWR receives money for its 
power purchases, and includes provisions for the issuance of bonds.
* Includes a provision for SDG&E rates since they were not covered under 
other legislation.

The bill passed the Senate Energy (8-2), and also just passed the Senate 
Appropriations Committee (8-2) and is headed to the Senate Floor.  


2. Senator Comments on the Bill:

Keeley (author of bill) presented that the bill would allow the PUC to decide 
the QF contracts which is the proper authority  to debate the issue.

Most of the opposition to this portion of the bill was regarding the fact 
that the bill provides no guidance to the PUC regarding voided costs for 
natural gas-fired QFs.  Republicans offered an amendment to not have section 
390 repealed for gas-fired generators, but Keeley had concerns with the 
amendment.  Keeley stated that he did not think they should limit the PUC's 
flexibility and that as drafted the amendment was too broad.  He also 
indicated that gas-fired utilities have a legitimate issue with the draft 
order.  He said that the PUC order needs to be amended, and Keeley is 
confident that the PUC has recognized that in discussion over the past 48 
hours.

3. Opponents to the QF Bill:


The following people testified in opposition to QF portion:  TURN, Delta 
Power (QF), Syke Energy, John Hancock Financial, California Manufacturers 
Association, Crockett Cogeneration, Independent Energy Producers, Clean Power 
Campaign, PG&E, SCE.

The gas-fired QFs that testified in opposition noted that they have been 
off-line for a couple of months and cannot come back on-line unless their 
issues are addressed.

In response to the QFs not getting paid, Sen. Bowen stated that if the 
utilities do not pay the QFs as directed under the draft order, then she 
would personally see to it that they go into bankruptcy.

4. PG&E and SCE Testimony:

Sen. Battin asked both utilities about the draft order, which states that 
after the change in the rates by QFs the utilities must pay the QFs within 15 
days, and whether the utilities would abide by the order.

PG&E's response was that they are receiving $400 million per month, the cost 
of their own generation is $100 million, and the QF amount is $240 million 
per month; the draft order would lower the QF cost to $140 million.   PG&E 
was cut off at this point and asked point blank whether their answer to 
Battin's question was ""yes or no.""  Battin, Bowen and Murray all asked
whether it was yes or no.  The PG&E rep stated that it would be ""no"" if the 
issue of the payments owed to ISO and DWR is not resolved.  If the ISO costs 
of purchases were included in the DWR payments, then PG&E would not have a 
problem.

The SCE response was that if the money coming in was less than the money 
going out, then it could not comply with the PUC order.

5.  Payments to DWR

Senator Sher then asked both utilities regarding a requirement under AB 1X 
that the utilities set aside those moneys that are owed to the DWR for 
purchasing power that they collect from ratepayers in a trust fund those.  
SCE responded that they are still in negotiations with DWR on the terms and 
conditions.  Several legislators responded angrily that this was not part of 
the bill, and that they should have a trust fund set up.  PG&E noted that 
they are setting 'some' money aside, but would not state how much. Sen. Sher 
ended the conversation by stating that if the utilities do not set up a trust 
fund by tomorrow they would either pass emergency legislation or 'go after 
them' for violating the law.

1X Provisions:

Tim Gage from Dept. of Finance noted the Governor's support of the entire 
bill, and noted that the 1X provisions would ensure that DWR gets paid.

PG&E also testified in opposition to these provisions.

Senator Bowen made the following statements:

* Senator Peace has announced that he has received another notice of $500 
million appropriation needed to purchase power and will not approve the 
funding unless PG&E and SCE drop their challenge to the PUC regarding the DWR 
issue.
* Also stated that the PUC could always raise rates as a way to resolve the 
issue.

Dear Mr. Kean:

I would like to thank you and Mark Schroeder very much for your time and
outstanding hospitality in Houston.  I very much enjoyed meeting with you
and your message, that your Chairman Kenneth Lay confirmed for dinner with
our Mayor Petra Roth was very well received and we are all very excited and
looking forward to November 30.

However it raises great interest in the question of organization of the
dinner and the additional participating chairpeople of other companies. Wil=
l
Enron now invite for that dinner, which I understand will be the gathering
of 10-12 major decision makers in the energy field? If you could be so kind
as to share with us the thoughts of Ken Lay=01%s office with regards to tha=
t
point, or give me a contact there, I would very much appreciate.

An alternative we discussed or as an addition the next day (Lunch), would b=
e
that a business-group would host an event, which could include a wider
audience of business people of Houston.  After having spoken with the Germa=
n
Consulate in Houston and with the German American Chamber here, it
unfortunately appears as if they will not be capable for s.th. we achieve.
Everybody recommended to work with the reputative Greater Houston
Partnership, whose President was on vacation last week.  I would welcome an=
y
assistance in getting us in contact with them.  Probably it would not take
too many efforts for Enron, to have them consider supporting out idea of
promoting our ideas. To help you pass them, I again include our plan for
Houston (see attached doc).

I will be in contact with your colleague Mark Palmer with regards to the
press-coverage. Thank you for your response to your earliest possible
convenience.

"Shelley,

My colleague, Clayton Vernon, who has a background in  economics, wrote a 
short summary of arguments
against the ROFR. 

We are working on the second approach to the problem: we try to come up with 
a numerical estimate of the
value of this option. The fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has 
distributional consequences:
he has something  of value he never paid for. Having a numerical estimate of 
the value of this option
could help to argue against it. The value of such an option is case specific; 
so we shall rather 
produce a template you can use for valuation case by case.

Subject: auctions with an incumbent's right of first refusal

Vince-

Here is an essay on the issue you are discussing:


The Adverse Economic Impact of ""Rights of First Refusal""

An option to ""first refuse"" to match a competitor's offer is a restraint of 
free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace. This economic 
conclusion is unambiguous.

If an ""incumbent"" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor, for 
an item or service of value, then few competitors will invest the time and 
expense necessary to prepare and submit offers, those offers will be lower 
than they would have been otherwise, and the contract will often be awarded 
to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger.

In a traditional auction, where all bids are sealed and the item up for 
auction is awarded to the highest bidder, we can safely predict the item will 
be awarded to the bidder who values it the most, at a price reflecting the 
full value of the item up for auction.  This is the efficient result in a 
market economy, because the financing of the high bid reflects resources 
freely allocated to the high bidder.  If the auction has open bids, we can 
again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder, albeit at 
a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the 
highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the 
second-highest valuation.

Now, in a modified auction, where an incumbent bidder has the right to match 
the highest bid and retain the item for himself, each competing bidder must 
justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the 
following, and likely, scenario: the incumbent does not spend himself for due 
diligence, but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the 
top bid from a competitor.

Simply put, the incumbent with a ""right of first refusal"" can be safely 
predicted to simply match their competitor's bid by ""rule of thumb."" But the 
incumbent's valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the 
valuation of the competitor, by the amount of the due diligence and 
administrative expenses.  And, the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise 
of his competitors, not only in their valuations themselves, a nontrivial 
financial exercise, but in any operational details required to be submitted 
along with the bid.

Furthermore, in an esoteric concept known as the ""Winner's Curse,"" a bidder 
realizes that if his bid actually prevails, if the incumbent fails to match 
it, he almost certainly overbid.

Given this, most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when 
an incumbent has the right of first refusal, and those that submit a bid do 
not rationally invest the time, expense and expertise necessary; they may 
just ""fire off"" a ""low-ball"" bid.  After all, in almost every conceivable 
""state of the world"" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose 
money.  So, the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a 
below-market price, despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest 
value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its 
most efficient use.

		 Subject: DRAFT presentation--Status report on California

Attached is the draft that we've discussed.  Few points:

It's a draft.  It would benefit from more tinkering.
It takes our core messages (what's the problem?  what's the solution?) and 
tries to weave in current events, understanding that by the time you're 
giving the presentation it may need to be further modified to correspond with 
rapidly changing circumstances and events.
It's frank but (hopefully) measured in describing the mess that is 
California.  It's set up so that it's easy to modify the more pointed 
statements.
Leaves plenty of room for you to tailor the presentation to particular points 
that you'd like to make, or data and/or information that you'd like to 
include.
I didn't have ready access to charts and graphs to back up the stats used in 
the text of the presentation, but I'm sure that it will be relatively easy 
for someone in Houston to pull that together (e.g., may want to poach a bit 
from Belden's presentation to include some PNW hydro stats (which I've also 
attached), or from ISO website to show load-resource balance info).
Though I'll be on vacation, I'll be checking in on voicemail and email, so if 
you have any questions, or need something additional to get the presentation 
ready, just let me know.
I may be in an airplane on Monday during both the leadership call and the 
newly restructured California call.  Otherwise, I'll be trying to make those 
calls dailywhile I'm away. 
And Jim, I'll also be available to participate in any calls regarding 
Calger's proposed deal with CDWR.
Finally, when the darn thing prints out, it prints borders around the 
heading/title box and the text box, though I don't know why.  Tried just 
about everything to get rid of them.  May want to have a PP guru in Houston 
see if (s)he can disable the boders.
Best,
Jeff

Kay - Sounds like Jeff is okay with the affiliate Master Purchase Sale 
Agreement from an Enron transactional point of view.  As this document will 
be filed with the ICC, I want to make sure that Boyd is agreement.  Assuming 
Boyd gives the all clear, we need to decide if we intend to file this right 
away or wait for the Hub Agency Agreement to be completed and make a joint 
filing.  However, I am cautiously optimistic that we are not too far apart on 
the Hub Agreement.  We had a commercial meeting yesterday and despite the 
obstacles presented by my supposed MEH partner, Roy, I think we made some 
headway.

are some conflict issues with several of the firms.  One firm was directly
conflicted.  Another has as one of its partners, the wife of Len Simon, the
lead plaintiff's counsel in our case.  Assuming that conflicts can be
resolved, we have five different lawyers available to be interviewed on
Monday.

"Jeff,

I am sending you a recommendation regarding our cooperation with the Wharton
School, following my visit with Tom Piazze in May. Tom is a Corporate 
Relations Officer
at Wharton.

Recommendation.

I am writing to you to recommend joining The Wharton Partnership.
The Partnership is an umbrella program established to coordinate
Wharton School initiatives for industry-academic cooperation. Currently,
the partnership supports alliances with approximately  200 companies 
worldwide.

The recommended annual contribution by Enron is between $100K-150K,
that puts us in the top bracket of contributing companies, such as GE, 
Citigroup,
Goldman, Sachs & Co., Intel, and many others.  The contribution is executed 
through
grants to different research projects that would directly benefit Enron. The 
choice
of the projects is at our discretion and can be changed over time
depending on the business needs.

Benefits to Enron. 

Enron can benefit from the Partnership by:

 - gaining advance access to current academic research  
 - significantly increasing our presence  and visibility on the campus,
   enhancing   our recruiting efforts
 - taking our message directly to influential academics who have significant
                   influence on public opinion
        - gaining access to high quality executive education programs

Specific Programs.

The Partnership functions through involvement in different research projects. 
I have
identified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to Enron.

1. WeBI (Wharton e-Business Initiative). This programs provides an umbrella
    for different initiatives in the area of curriculum development, research 
and 
    corporate engagement related to e-commerce.

    Main benefits: access to e-commerce research and
    enhanced recruitment opportunities.

2. Emerging Technologies Management Research Program. Interdisciplinary
    program addressing issues facing companies in new markets: managing 
intellectual
    property, participating in emerging technologies, selecting the optimal
    organizational structures.

    Benefits to Enron: access to financial technology in the area of 
valuation of
    intangible assets and new forms of business organizations.

3. Risk Management and Decision Process Center. Development of techniques for
    assessment and management of non-traditional risks (risks outside the 
scope
    of traditional insurance contracts and capital markets instruments). 

    Benefits to Enron: access to new risk management tools, dissemination
    of information about our capabilities in this area.

Potential users of the program at Enron.

My group could coordinate the cooperation with the Risk Management and 
Decision Process Center.

Greg Whalley is a potential customer for WeBI. Several different units of 
Enron can be involved 
with  Emerging Technologies Management Research Program.

"Gentlemen:

Here are the revised documents in both clean and marked form.  I made the 
requested change in the Term section.  That section defines a Early

I spoke to Fuel Cells and here is my suggested schedule for the negotiations:

October 11, 2000--We redraft purchase order and send it to FuelCells.

October 12, 2000-We hold a conference call with FuelCells in the morning to 
walk them through the P.O. and give them our thoughts (probable length 1-1.5 
hours).  We continue to work on P.O.
 
October 15, 2000--Kay flies to New York.  We have a conference call with 
FuelCells in the afternoon to discuss their initial comments on P.O.  Kay 
meets with Bingham to get work assignments started (i.e., permitting work, 
start drafting construction agreement, changes to Development 
Agreement...etc).  Scott takes 'red-eye"" flight to N.Y.

October 16, 2000--Meet with FuelCells in Bingham's offices.  Continue 
negotiations on P.O.

October 17-19, 2000--To be determined based on progress of meetings.  If need 
be, we could continue negotiations in Houston or have Kay patch in by the 
telephone or do all the negotiations by telephone.  

What are your thoughts?

"Too late with your spreadsheet.  The instructions that we got from Donna were 
that I should review the resumes, pass them to Brent for his review, and then 
on to Causey for his review.  Considering our schedules and the large number 
of resumes to review, that would have been an impossible task to complete by 
Thursday at noon.  I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday, just before 
leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma.  I asked Patti to 
make a copy of the packet for Brent, and I knew that Rick would not want to 
take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening 
first.  I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way 
back to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of 
the business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training 
class.  We got those to Rick today by noon, as he was leaving the office.  I 
believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will 
pass the resumes along to you.  Since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this 
morning after Brent and I had done our reviews, you will have to 
cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.  

Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the 
resumes as well.  I would suggest that in the future that your team should 
make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the 
review.  The plan of passing them from one person to another is not 
practical,  and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.  If you 
are going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time 
frame, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.  If someone from 
you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that 
would have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes.  
Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes 
of MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not 
Analysts interviews.  Please give us organized information to react to, not 
simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.  All of us want to 
participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process, but 
we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and 
organizational work.  

I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program 
and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role, not being 
critical.  I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.   

Brent and I (and I am sure Hunter, too) would have appreciated "

Subject: George Cheated

Neither the Republican presidential candidate, nor
the Democratic presidential candidate had enough
votes to win the election. Therefore, it was decided
that there should be an ice-fishing contest between 
the two candidates to determine the final winner.

There was much talk about ballot recounting, court
challenges, etc., but a weeklong ice-fishing competition 
seemed the fairest way to settle things.  The candidate 
that catches the most fish at the end of the week wins. 
After a lot of back and forth discussion, it was decided 
that the contest would take place on a remote and cold 
lake in Minnesota.  There were to be no observers present 
since both men were to be sent out on this remote lake and
return daily with their catch for counting and verification.

At the end of the first day, George W. Bush returns to the 
starting line and he has 10 fish. Soon, Al Gore returns and 
has zero fish. Well, everyone assumes Al is just having 
another bad hair day or something and hopefully he will 
catch up the next day.

At the end of the 2nd day, George W. comes in with 20 fish 
and Al Gore comes in again with none. That evening, Bill 
Clinton gets together secretly with Al Gore and says; ""Al, 
I think George W. is cheatin'.  I'ma gonna dress this good 
ole' Southern Boy, James Carville, up in a costume and send 
him out on the lake to act as a spy"".  

The next night (after George W. comes back with 50 fish and 
Al Gore with none), Bill gets Carville and Al Gore together 
and says to Carville: ""Well, what about it boy, is George W. 
cheatin'?"" ""  He sure is, Bill, he's cuttin' holes in the ice!""

Shelly, 

Hunter spoke with Li today and agrees that her first rotation should be in 
Vince's group doing modelling, etc.  This will give her the broadest 
experience for a first rotation.  I'm sure the other person in question, 
Vikas, will do very well in Hunter's group.  

Thanks for your help.

Wow I don't think so.   I thought I would rewrite yours and correct some of 
the factual errors.  If you disagree please write me back.

I moved from our Houston office in 1994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named 
President of the Canadian operation.  We went from a small gas marketing shop 
to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada.  It was 
absolutely awesome.  I had the time of my life.  We built the business with 
very little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's 
bottom line.  These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading 
and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create 
liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others.  
So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help 
build revolutionary new businesses.

What a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk 
management presence is in Natural Gas and Power.  The opportunities our 
outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.  These 
businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different 
variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage 
in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina.  You can't 
put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other 
commodities.  Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to 
figure out what the Fed is going to do.  It has much more complexity, and if 
you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it.....get down 
here! .... we need you!

John's callout quote

Enron's not a place where you can hide.  If you can't get it done you won't 
fit in.  But if you can, and you work hard, you'll get noticed, you'll 
excell, you'll get paid, and we're going to love you.

 I believe that you will need to get this form approved by the legal group in

Attached is a series of press releases by MG Plc regarding their metals 
website, the first of which was launched on or about October 4, 1999.

I also have a message in to the attorneys at Enron that worked closely on the 
acquisition, but one of our commercial people understands the site to be an 
on-line brokerage system (like E*Trade) -- the press release on the launch of 
the system (at the bottom of this message) indicates that the site is an LME 
trading and execution system.  I'll forward over any other information I can 
find.     




USA: Metal exchanges hold firm as Web trading blooms.

06/22/2000
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2000. 

NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - The world's two largest metal exchanges said 
they will retain their roles despite the rapid expansion in Internet trading 
and as another major metal dealer announced the launch of an online trading 
system on Thursday. 
The London Metal Exchange (LME) is carefully planning its introduction of 
electronic trading in the second-half of this year and refuses to be 
""spooked"" by those ""urging action, any action, as long as it is now,"" 
Jonathan Haslam, LME director of corporate affairs, told a conference in New 
York.
His comments were echoed by Patrick Thompson, president of the New York 
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), who said it would be very difficult for the new 
online trading systems to bring together those elements that underpinned the 
success of the traditional exchanges. 
Thompson told the Metal Bulletin E-Commerce 2000 conference that said these 
elements included the handling of counterparty credit risk, the clearing of 
trades and the existing pools of liquidity provided by the different segments 
of the metals market which use the exchanges. 
Haslam compared the LME's trading turnover averaging $8 billion a day with 
the around $1.5 billion a day traded online by U.S. energy giant Enron Corp. 
. 
Enron's expansion in the e-commerce market was earlier referred to by Thomas 
Pimpinelli, senior vice president of MG London Inc. part of U.K.-based metals 
trading group MG Plc . In May, MG agreed to a 300 pence per share cash offer 
from Enron. 
Pimpinelli said MG's own MITS online metals trading system, launched in 
October 1999, has to date processed over 135,000 contracts with an overall 
value of $5.25 billion. 
He told the meeting that between 65 percent to 80 percent of MG's order flow, 
mostly from small metals clients, was now done over the Internet. 
Pimpinelli said the success of its ""Market Maker"" real-time trading facility 
within MITS for tonnages of up to a 1,000 tonnes, had encouraged the company 
to create a new product for the Managed Futures industry called ""CTA Trader."" 
The product will differ from Market Maker in that the customer can trade 
larger volumes, request a volume quote on-line, and then have the facility to 
book the resulting live on-line quote. 
""Once executed the customers will need to breakdown or allocate the 
transaction to his individual or multiple pre-approved clearing houses by way 
of a dropdown menu,"" he said. Pimpinelli added that CTA Trader would be 
launched in the next month or so. 
Sharing a platform with Pimpinelli, Karl Hackert, head of e-commerce at U.S. 
trader Koch Metals, announced the impending launch of his company's own 
online metals trading system by the end of June. Koch metals is a unit of 
Koch Industries Inc. . 
Hackert said the issue of the LME's daily forward prices valuation at 5.30 
p.m. in London, meant that the level of these quotes wasn't clear during the 
rest of the trading day. Under the new Koch system prices will be updated 
every five seconds and out to 27 months. 
""Koch are the first to do this (offer near real-time forward prices) and it 
is a big step forward in terms of market transparency,"" he said. 
Hackert said Koch had built its system to better communicate with its clients 
and it did not intend to go into direct competition with the LME. 
""Making a generic mass system? I don't think that's the business we're in,"" 
he said.

UK: UPDATE 2-MG to widen access to online metals trade.
By Andy Blamey

06/13/2000
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2000. 

LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - U.K.-based metals trading group MG plc said on 
Tuesday it would broaden access to its online metals trading systems as the 
battle for web pre-eminence comes to the boil. 
MG, one of the world's leading metals traders, said it would allow London 
Metal Exchance clearing members to use the system, which had been restricted 
to clients, with immediate effect.
The move comes in response to strong demand for access to the system, an MG 
spokesman said. MG has so far signed up 14 Category One (ring dealing) and 
Category Two (associate broker clearing) members of the LME. 
""We have decided to broaden the availability of Market Maker following the 
rapid increase in volumes and substantial uptake by both existing and new 
clients,"" said Michael Hutchinson, CEO of MG's Financial Services Division in 
a statement. 
""We are confident that we have an online product which will meet demand from 
other clearing members of the LME."" 
The wider access to MG's system need not necessarily pose a threat to other 
online marketplaces, said Gavin Gross, head of LME metals at brokerage 
Spectron Futures Ltd. Spectron plans to launch online systems to trade London 
Metal Exchange contracts later this month. 
""They're very different models. MG is a principal in the market, so you're 
looking at MG prices only. Spectron is neutral, we're just providing a 
platform. It's a multilateral system with lots of dealers interacting with 
each other,"" Gross said. 
""The two can exist side by side,"" he added. 
Over 80 percent of MG's clients are now using its online services, the 
company said. Market Maker turnover stood at 3,000 contracts in May - a 
growth rate of approximately 50 percent per month since the launch in January 
of this year. 
Online deals still make up a low proportion of MG's total trading turnover, 
however. 
MG's MITS system launched in October 1999 and has now processed over 95,000 
contracts with a dollar value in excess of $3.8 billion and a monthly 
turnover in excess of $1 billion. 
""We are using it (MITS) for the one or two lot small stop orders that you 
previously missed and had the customer ringing up asking if we had done his 
trade,"" said one user of an MG system at an ABCM. 
However, it would appear that MG is now limiting the size of the orders it 
will accept on MITS from its non-customers, he said. 
Metals e-commerce sites are proliferating, but they follow no single business 
model. There are portals run by single principals quoting their own prices; 
intranets where big market players are cooperating; different rules for 
access; and a wide variation in revenue models, the key to profitability. 
The company announced in March it had joined Internet Capital Group and 
Safeguard International Fund to form the EMETRA joint venture, in which MG 
has a 25 percent stake. 
EMETRA is building a worldwide business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce 
marketplace for the non-ferrous metals markets, including physical trading a 
futures and options contracts. 
MG contributed its Internet systems to EMETRA and continues to use MITS and 
Market Maker under a licence agreement with EMETRA. 
In May, MG agreed a 300 pence per share cash offer from U.S. energy and 
communications group Enron, a major player in the e-commerce market through 
Enron Online, which trades around 840 products in some 13 countries in 11 
currencies.

US Enron Bid For MG May Signal End Of LME Outcry Trading
By Adam Aljewicz

05/23/2000
Dow Jones International News 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron's (ENE) offer to buy London Metal Exchange ring 
dealing firm MG PLC (U.MGA) could bring the exchange one step closer to 
ending open outcry trading, dealers say. 
Both the U.S.-based energy and communications group, and MG have pioneered 
electronic trading and are widely seen as being among the only participants 
on the LME trading floor capable of making the transition to on-screen 
trading. The LME, meanwhile, is also seeking to introduce on-screen 
technology for out-of-ring trading sessions.
""We're not surprised in the least to see this tie-up take place,"" an analyst 
at Deutsche Bank told Dow Jones Newswires. ""Everything we see now is pointing 
toward the removal of the ring-dealing sessions, and it's just a matter of 
time before it ends all together,"" she said. 
MG's chairman Tom McKeever said the company won't abandon its position as an 
LME ring dealing member, but market watchers doubt whether - after 123 years 
- open outcry can survive on the LME as fast-paced technological change 
sweeps through the industry. 
Enron has made a GBP300 million cash offer for London-based MG in a bid to 
gain a foothold in the $120 billion-a-year world metal market. The U.S. 
company already has a substantial market share in natural gas and electricity 
markets, and with its electronic trading platform, Enron On Line, it has 
already executed more than 110,000 transactions valued at over $45 billion 
since its launch in November. 
""It's not surprising to see a strategic link up between an energy and metals 
company because they're both very big in industrial commodities,"" said an 
analyst for a U.S.-based commission house. ""I think it's almost inevitable 
that open outcry trading will be a thing of the past,"" he said. 
Enron's move into the metals market has also been linked to the LME's growing 
interest in initiating an automated trading system, and has lead some market 
watchers to suggest that the Enron-MG tie-up will lead to greater 
consolidation among LME members. 
Metals trading companies and brokerage firms are struggling to survive as 
profits wane amid the growth of banks and funds in the metals trading arena. 
""Out of the 13 ring dealing firms on the LME, I think only six will be able 
to make the transition to on-screen trading,"" said a dealer for a 
London-based bank. ""And that's only because we have a banking background,"" he 
said. 
The six cited are MG, the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia, 
U.S.-based brokerage Refco Inc., Credit Lyonnais Rouse, Barclays Capital and 
Fimat Metals. 
The LME's existing system involves the trading of eight metals within its 
circular trading floor. Around 35% of the LME's trading takes place there, 
but this figure could drop if the LME decides to abandon open outcry, traders 
say. ""Market participants will have to decide whether to use the ring 
or go through the Internet,"" said a dealer. ""That's how it will start
and will probably lead to the trading floor being bypassed
altogether."" 

MG, which was spun off from Germany's Metallgesellschaft last September, has 
pioneered the use of metals trading on the Internet with the launch in 
October of MITS and MARKET MAKER, its Internet trading system. 
MG is the second-largest physical merchant of copper, nickel and aluminum in 
Europe after Switzerland's Glencore. 
""When profit margins are narrowing and so many LME companies are looking more 
and more uncertain about their future, MG (is) arguably the pick of the crop 
in terms of stability and profitably,"" said a dealer for a North 
American-owned ring dealing firm. LME Considers Screen Trading 

Separately, the LME has considered a series of moves that would also hasten 
the demise of open outcry trading. 
It has repeatedly said it is looking to develop an electronic screen-trading 
system for use in out of ring trading sessions, and that it plans to press 
ahead with changes to its ownership structure by demutualizing in favor of 
becoming a shareholder entity. 
""We've made very clear that there are proposals for consequential changes to 
the LME's governance,"" said Jonathan Haslam, director of corporate affairs at 
the LME. 
The LME set up an eight-member committee in February which comprised four 
ring dealing members and four associate broker members to map out a strategy 
for the implementation of new technology. 
However, it has so far declined to comment on how this technology will be 
executed, although Haslam has said the LME is looking at around 20 companies 
with the requisite knowledge and background to provide and implement the 
on-screen technology. 
""We said we would look into setting up an interoffice screen trading system 
but we have yet to come to a decision on who our technical partner will be,"" 
he said. ""But we should come to a decision in a couple of weeks.""

MG exceeds $1B Internet trade target

Post Company). All rights reserved. 

LONDON - International metals trader MG PLC said yesterday that business on 
its six-month old Internet trading systems had comfortably exceeded its 
transaction value target of $1-billion (all figures in U.S. dollars). 
""We are at $1.5-billion as of this morning. We are are very pleased with the 
progress and the rate of growth,"" said Tom McKeever, MG chairman.
He noted that online trading in metals is seen growing rapidly, according to 
a recent study by Anderson Consulting. Just 2% to 3% of business in the 
non-ferrous industry is currently conducted online, while in three to five 
years it will be 40% to 60%, he said. 
Since the launch in October, volumes on MG's internet systems, known as MITS 
and MARKET MAKER, have increased by 50% a month and cumulatively exceed 
30,000 contracts now. 
MG said it had also gained customers as its systems are the only ones that 
currently offer online trading. ""When we launched the system, we had requests 
from many new customers to register. We registered quite a few new customers. 
It is beyond our expectations,"" Mr. McKeever added. 
The increase in on-line business on MITS has been seen round the clock as 
customers have become increasingly comfortable with the system. 
""We were the first to start the system. It has been late coming to the metals 
business, but we think it is good for the industry,"" he said. 
Last month, MG announced it had joined Internet Capital Group and Safeguard 
International Fund to form an eMetra joint venture in which it has a 25% 
stake.

MG PLC - Trading Update

MG INTERNET TRADING UPDATE 
MG announces that in the first six months of trading on its Internet systems, 
MITS and MARKET MAKER, it has surpassed its target of US $1 billion in value 
of transactions. The volume of transactions has been increasing by 50% a 
month since October and cumulatively exceeds 30,000 contracts.
The trading systems have attracted new customers as well as MG's existing 
customers because it is the only system currently available that offers them 
an on-line LME trading and execution service. 
The launch of MITS was announced in October 1999 by MG. In February, MG 
announced that it had joined with Internet Capital Group and Safeguard 
International Fund to form the eMetra joint venture, in which MG has a 25% 
stake. eMetra is in the process of establishing a worldwide 
business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce marketplace for the non-ferrous metals 
markets, including physical trading and the trading of futures and options 
contracts. MG contributed its Internet systems to eMetra and continues to use 
MITS and MARKET MAKER under a licence agreement with eMetra. Once eMetra is 
fully operational later this year, MG will become a user of eMetra's 
platform. 
Michael Hutchinson, Joint Chief Executive of MG plc, said: ""We are delighted 
that so many customers to date have transferred their business on to the 
Internet - we see this trend as increasing significantly in the coming

City: MG plans to launch metals website
James Ashton

The Daily Telegraph

MG, the international metals trader, yesterday unveiled plans to develop an 
internet marketplace for trading non-ferrous metals, in direct competition 
with the London Metals Exchange (LME). 
The joint venture with the Internet Capital Group (ICG) and private equity 
fund Safeguard International will establish a worldwide business-to-business 
e-commerce platform for non-ferrous metals. This will include physical 
trading and the trading of options and futures contracts.
MG shares soared 140 1/2 to 337 1/2 p. 
""We didn't go into this venture intending to put anyone out of business,"" 
said chairman Thomas McKeever. 
He added that the as-yet-unnamed new venture would attract new clients, 
particularly small and medium-sized companies who regard conventional LME 
trade as too costly and complex. 
He said he also hoped to open up the derivatives market to smaller players. 
""When you develop a global marketplace you attract, presumably, most industry 
participants,"" he added. 
Safeguard and Nasdaq-listed ICG, which already has stakes in more than 50 
companies offering online trading in sectors such as industrial chemicals, 
plastics and cattle, have invested a total of $25 million in the venture, 
taking 30 and 45pc stakes respectively. 
MG, the world's largest copper merchant, will hold an initial 25pc, with an 
option to increase that to 50pc within eight months. The company, which 
floated last September at 205p, after being spun off from German engineering 
group Metallgesellschaft, will continue to operate its internet trading 
system Mits for existing customers. It began live internet dealing of 
aluminium and copper in January.

MG expects MITS to be a hit.

DUSSELDORF -- Only one week after London Metal Exchange trader 
Metallgesellschaft Ltd. launched its web site system that allows trade 
execution services on the Internet, it is optimistic that the concept will be 
a hit. 
""It's been quite extraordinary,"" said Alex Health, MG's director of 
e-commerce systems. ""We've had something like 300 reactions so far from both 
existing customer companies as well as new ones logging on."" He said that the 
non-customers entering MG'S site (www.mgltd.co.uk) ranged from large groups 
MG had wanted to make contact with for a longtime to small companies that 
Heath said he'd never heard of. 

""Of course, it's LME Week now, so we are busy with socializing and making 
contacts there before we can reply to the requests we've received,"" Heath 
said. He noted that LME Week was one important factor in launching the 
Metallgesellschaft Internet Trading System (MITS) in time to display it at 
Broker's House by Tuesday evening. MG Plc's recent floatation also provided a 
major motivation for the project to raise MG's profile, he said: 
Heath said that MITS has not had an immediate effect on trading volumes 
beyond the regular market, activity, but 70. customers so far had used the 
facility for deals. He added that MITS might soon contribute to MG's customer 
base, but it would take some time for new parties attracted to the site to be 
registered as regular customers. 
At the beginning of LME Week, few LME trading companies were prepared to 
comment on MITS and its possible effect on metals trading. MG's presentations 
at the LME event were aimed at providing a clearer picture. ""I'd be extremely 
disappointed if the idea didn't spread as the Internet will inevitably be a 
big factor in trading,"" Heath said. He noted that MG put itself under 
pressure by moving before some other company with a similar 
project-in-the-making could enter the scene. 
""Speed is a definite factor in the Internet, and we can claim to be leading 
into the new millennium in this regard,"" he said, adding that MG received 
many ""flattering comments"" from brokers. 
Peter Sellars of Barclays Bank Plc conceded that ""certainly they got there 
before anybody else"" but added that ""they won't have very much of a lead 
time."" He said that the Internet was going to be the way of the future and 
that Barclays was making similar preparations, but so far offered a web site 
order trading system only for non-metallic futures. He noted, however, that 
web site trading would not satisfy all requirements. ""It's great for the 
small bread-and-butter stuff, but for long-term contracts it's gonna be 
tricky, isn't it,"" Sellars said. 
A spokesman at Triland Metals Ltd., another LME member, questioned whether MG 
was really embracing technology or vice versa. ""It could be a gimmick for 
customers, and it doesn't really mean they're successful with enlarging their 
customer base,"" he said. He noted that people were always interested in 
coming close but weren't necessarily keen on taking the final step. He said 
that Triland had no immediate plans for a similar service and that it was 
confining its web site plans to statistics and other basic information. ""They 
jumped the gun to a certain extent, but we'll have to see if it's successful 
or not.""

MG Launches First Internet Metals Trade Service
A Wall Street Journal Europe Roundup

10/05/1999
The Wall Street Journal Europe

(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

LONDON -- MG PLC has launched the first Internet-based metals futures trading 
system. 
MG, which went public on the London Stock Exchange in September, offers a 
full trading and execution service on the London Metals Exchange.
The system, which is called MITS, will be supported by a real-time price 
screen for all the metals traded on the LME and includes a multi-currency 
facility. The LME trades copper, aluminium, lead, zinc, nickel, tin, silver 
and aluminium alloy. 
In addition, customers can listen to a direct voice commentary from the floor 
of the LME during trading sessions. 
Technical analysis and market research on all LME metals is available and 
regularly updated. Customers can also access their position and valuation 
statements over a secure encrypted link to the firm's computer system. 
MITS can only be accessed by registered customers of Metallgesellsc haft 
Limited, MG's LME brokerage and trading arm. 
""It is a customer service and it is live now to our registered customers,"" 
said Michael Hutchinson, MG's joint chief executive. 
MG's customers will also be able to listen to a direct-voice commentary from 
the floor of the LME during trading sessions. They will also be able to 
access their position and valuation statements over a secure encrypted link 
to MG's computer system, MG said. 
The LME is the world's largest non-ferrous metals market with 14 ring-dealing 
members who participate in the twice-daily important open-outcry sessions. 
The LME settlement prices for metals which are realized in the official 
morning trading sessions are the benchmark reference prices for most of the 
world's physical contracts. 
Outside the open-outcry sessions, LME business takes place over a 24-hour 
period via an inter-office telephone market. 
""We are always interested in any new uses of technology. We will watch this 
with interest,"" an LME spokeswoman said. 
MG said it intended to develop its website to eventually include real-time 
physical metal prices and premiums. 
MG's system is the latest in a series of Internet commodity trading systems.

Subject: havmann - lpg claim with underwriters


john,

sorry it has taken so long to reply to the copy of the fax from clyde & co 
which you passed to me some time ago.

basically, i reviewed the paper from sgs on copper corrosion contamination in 
lpg which reviewed possible scenarios of the lpg becoming off spec during a 
sea voyage. their conclusion was that propane which contained polysulphides 
could meet the copper corrosion tests at loading but then decompose during 
the long voyage to turn the propane off spec for copper corrosion. this 
position would support what clyde & co are saying as a factor against enron's 
case. 

the whole contamination problem, while possibly an inherent vice, was an 
unknown inherent vice. nobody was aware of this problem at the time of 
loadings but rather the problem came to light once some of the first ships 
reached their discharge ports. the sgs report also brings into account other 
reasons for the copper corrosion failure such as:

a) unclean cargo tanks, containing sulfur from previous cargoes,
b) mixing of two grades of lpg, both initially on spec,
c) the use of unclean inert gas, and
d) other incompatible corrosive cargoes (such as ammonia) by improper 
cleaning procedures.

i did take the liberty to call chris clucas of dorchester maritime's 
technical department whom i met when dorchester was managing the enron owned 
ships. it was chris who initially sent me the sgs paper as an update to the 
gastech 1988 paper.

it may be a good thing i did call him as he mentioned a subsequent paper 
issued by sgs in about 1998, by g.vermeiren, where sgs went to saudi to check 
their procedures during the time of these off spec cargo loadings. it appears 
the paper's conclusion is that unknowingly saudi may have put some pacifiers 
into the propane which would have caused the copper corrosion to show as on 
spec. therefore, the product could have actually been off spec before it was 
loaded but, due to the pacifiers, tested as on spec.

in summary, i would agree with clyde & co that this should be settled, 
especially with the amount being discussed. i do not know where this claim 
stands and again apologize for the delayed reply.

regards

consider extending it we should probably discuss it in a smaller group than

Hi Carol:

Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+
to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause
to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those
provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the
other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC
clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the
L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on
this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and
congratulations.

Regards,

Steve

		 Subject: California Update 3/06/01


Executive Summary
? If no comprehensive deal is reached by April 9th, chances of bankruptcy 
increase due to a one day ""opt-out"" clause in all long-term power contracts. 
? PG&E and State locked in tough negotiations, several issues on the table:
 PUC-imposed requirement forcing PG&E to ultimately be responsible for 
California energy supplies
 Price of the grid; state - 2.3 times book value vs. PG&E - 4 times book value
? PG&E will not use any of the $1B secured last week to help their ailing 
utility.
? Davis's announcement of long term power contract didn't include some 
details:
 Of the 8,800 megawatts secured this far, only 6,000 are available this 
summer 
 Some of the ""long term contracts"" are really only for three months
 None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot 
market
? One the same day Davis announced long term contracts, Davis also quietly 
announce a 10% rate hike.
? FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal.
 
PG&E
Transmissions deal
One thing that is still uncertain is PG&E.  Bankruptcy may still be a likely 
alternative if current negotiations to buy PG&E's share of the electric 
transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April 9 (when all long-term power 
contracts being negotiated have a one-day ""opt-out"" clause they can exercise 
unilaterally if a ""comprehensive solution"" has not been reached by the state 
and its major utilities).  According to sources close to senior PG&E 
officials, PG&E made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal 
on the transmission lines depends on the California government's willingness 
to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make 
until now. 

PG&E will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to 
relieve it of the PUC-imposed requirement to be the ""electricity buyer of 
last resort.""  Current state regulations make the utility companies 
ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all 
times to supply California's energy needs.  As long as the state steps in and 
makes those purchases, as it has for the past three months, the utilities are 
shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot 
market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings.  
But, PG&E officials are worried 1) this summer's supply and 2) Davis's 
concern over how fast he is draining the state's budget surplus.  If things 
get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state 
will pay only for the electricity it buys through long-term contracts, then 
PG&E will be left holding the bag. 

Thus, as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid, PG&E is 
demanding a ""comprehensive solution"" that includes not being liable for cost 
differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed 
to pay.  State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of ""get out of 
jail free"" card, so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough 
negotiations that are complicated by three other factors: (1) PG&E's public 
behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to 
encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy; (2) State legislative 
demands that the price Davis negotiate for PG&E's part of the electricity 
grid be no more than 2.3 times revenues from the grid; and (3) the FERC must 
""positively approve"" any grid purchase by the state of California. 

The principal concern on the price front is that PG&E wants to sell the 
electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their 
transmission, while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the 
politically acceptable limit.  ""We see 2.3 times book value as an absolute 
upper bound. There is no way PG&E will get more than that, whatever they 
think,"" according to the leader of one main consumer groups.  ""We are going 
to try to force any deals down to about 2.0 in any case."" Negotiators for 
Davis are also trying to 'proposition-proof' any transmission deal to protect 
against a later ballot proposal.  They think there are ways to do that, but 
not if the price of PG&E's part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative.  
Remember, if Davis's eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative, he will 
be running for re-election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed 
to overturn his solution.

On the Sacramento front - no one understands PG&E's motives
The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game 
PG&E is playing.  In a three day period PG&E made a series of announcements 
that left everyone scratching their heads. 
? Late Thursday, PG&E officials leaked information to California papers that 
they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity 
transmission grid to the state, which seemed like obvious good news, but then 
made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30% 
above what the state was currently offering.  While a deal can still be done, 
anything like the $10 billion PG&E wants would be very hard to get through 
the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase. 
? Late Friday, PG&E officials announced that they had secured a $1 billion 
loan for the parent company (not the electricity utility) and would use the 
money to pay off bondholders, other creditors and to return $161 million to 
shareholders in a new dividend payout.  Not a cent of that money was 
earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PG&E and that left at 
least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the 
utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood. 
? Over the weekend, PG&E leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay 
off its energy suppliers' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now.  For 
generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to 
start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy 
action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will 
""make them whole"" in a couple of months, that kind of trial balloon is 
extremely unnerving.

Thus, in a very short time period, PG&E's corporate owners showed they could 
access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they 
were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the 
energy crisis.  Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at 
least a part of the $13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer 
and PG&E's fund-raising will harden and deepen those demands.  As one senior 
political official told our source ""just when you think the corporate 
leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible, they 
come up with something even more outrageous."" 

PG&E's actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to 
construct to solve California's problems.  State Democrats doubt they will 
get Republican support for a deal, which means a vote will fall short of the 
two-thirds majority necessary for immediate enactment (resulting in 90 days 
for the legislation to go into effect).  Additionally, in the past 48 hours, 
many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less 
in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and 
may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the 
electricity grid.

Long-term Contracts - Davis didn't tell the whole truth
Yesterday, Davis announced that he had signed ""long-term"" power deals for 
8,800 megawatts of power, out of a total 12,000 megawatts he wanted to sign 
eventually. According to the press release, Davis is now 75% of the way 
toward his long-term goal and has already solved the hardest part of 
California's energy crisis. This means consumers would maybe pay more than 
necessary five years from now, but these contracts ""guaranteed"" that 
consumers would pay less for the next three years.  What Davis failed to 
highlight was that of the 8,800 megawatt commitment, actually only 6,000 
megawatts are available this summer (when demand is expected to 45,000 
megawatts); and some of these ""long-term contracts"" are actually only good 
for three months.  None of these contracts, however, keep California from 
having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market.

Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year
While the media was concern with Davis's announcement of long term contracts 
for California, of less concern to the media was Davis's quietly announced a 
decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers. The state will 
accept the 10% emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a 
permanent increase as well as an additional 10% increase for consumers that 
will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires. 
That would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour. 

FERC
The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve 
it in a positive vote. Senior California officials and legislators doubt that 
FERC has jurisdiction, and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal. But 
they may be wrong. ""The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs 
off on the deal. Its power over transmission deal is absolute, no matter what 
anyone says,"" according to source close to the President. There are three 
possibilities: 1) FERC could ""pocket veto"" it by not even putting it on 
agenda for discussion; 2) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted 
down. The Democrat on the commission, William Massey, has already said he is 
opposed to it; or 3) the Commission could approve it but with condition that 
Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system.

One complicating factor in the FERC decision, however, is that its chairman 
Curt Hebert, who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale, may not 
be around long enough to have his say. ""Hebert is definitely not a shoo in 
for the FERC chairman position,"" says one Washington official. Two other 
appointments to the Commission will soon be named, this official notes, and 
one of them ""could easily become chairman.""

Hi, gang. Sheila called last Friday and let me know you were working on this 
off-balance sheet EPC form, and that it was expected to be out on Friday, 
maybe Monday for review and commment, which was needed PDQ becuase of a 
looming project.  I have not seen any copy of the form or had any update on 
the status of the project.

Kay/Dave, could one of you send the form to me and let me know the big 
picture status?

"Gil:  I left you a voice mail earlier.  I'm concerned about the definition of ""Specified Transaction"".  As drafted, I read this as cross defaulting to all other derivative trades between ENA and BSIL, as well as ENE and BSIL.  I don't know if we have any on the books or will enter into any prior to termination of your trades, but the same will be impacted unless you limit the Section 14 definition to your trades only.

"Lisa,  I feel so bad right now.  I never wanted anything but to be with you 
and love you the rest of my life.  I wish we knew how important it was to 
communicate with each other over the past years.  I think we are both guilty 
of not communicating.  It is easier to talk to some besides each other about 
certain things because of certain expectations or assumptions that have been 
built up over our portion of a lifetime together.  It hurts to now clearly 
understand this after things have happened.

I am scared of you moving in with Chris because I fear that we both may 
accept it as final.  I don't want it to be that and I want us to genuinely 
work on this relationship.  I want us to talk and do things together.  You 
are my one true love."

Subject: Your speaking engagement at Baylor on evening of February 23


Dear Vince,

I am following up concerning your upcoming speaking engagement at Baylor on
evening of February 23.  Of course, I'll plan to see you during the
afternoon at John Martin's ""new economy"" conference.  That evening, you
will be the dinner speaker for the official chartering ceremony of the
Gamma Iota Sigma Risk Management and Insurance fraternity.  We are hoping
for a really good turnout that evening, and expect guests not only from
around Texas but also possibly other parts of the country.  I am not sure
what your travel plans are, but I did take the liberty of setting up a
guaranteed reservation for you at the Marriott Courtyard (Confirmation
#84857419).  Let me know if you don't need the reservation, but otherwise
it will be available to you.

I also am interested in finding out whether I might be able to attract you
to campus on another occasion to speak to my corporate risk management
classes.  Perhaps we can discuss this possibility when we see each other
about three weeks from now.

Sincerely, with best regards,

Jim Garven

Dear Jeff and Sue:

Sorry to be a broken record on this one....but I don't know what you want to
do about the Affiliates case.  There is a PHC tomorrow and comments were
filed.  SCE's comments make a nasty jab at Enron for proposing the rules in
the first place.  I see that AReM is participating as well.  If your plan is
to participate in this proceeding only through AReM, that's fine but please
let me know so that I can remove my appearance.  I will be at the PHC for
Wild Goose but would like to be very clear about who I am representing in
the docket in order to avoid confusion.

Subject:	MARGARITA PARTY!! (now that I have Mike's attention...)

Dear Band of Brothers!  (sorry...I'm reading Ambrose's book by the same name)

Scott Tholan and I thought it'd be cool to pull together the old Skunk Works crew for a reunion.  The goal of the meeting is to brainstorm data collection technologies and applications to better serve Enron customers -->> we want to get ahead of customer needs rather than forever being reactive to requirements blowing in from left field.  This is not necessarily about dreaming up whiz-bang technologies.  It's about pooling our knowledge of customer information gaps, and identifying old/new technologies to collect data that make our customers smarter and richer. 

 A steady flow margaritas would free the collective brainpower and creativity.  Who else is cleared into TAC programs and should be a part of this shindig?

Scott's out next week, so let's shoot for Tues, 11 SEP.  Let's say from 1500hrs until??  I'm serious about the margaritas.......

Any problems with this date/time?

Many thanks and looking forward to a good session!

The California business community needs your help in opposing AB67 XX.  This
bill represents a dangerous attempt to rewrite SB78 XX, the Edison bail-out
legislation, which passed the Assembly last Friday.  After months of good
faith discussions the amendments the California Business Coalition so
strongly advocated for have been completely disregarded.  Direct Access
continues to be threatened and an unfair rate increase for large energy
users still lingers.

We urge you to contact your local delegation to express your opposition to
this inequitable legislation.  The Senate will be voting on SB67 XX
immediately.  If passed, the bill will go to the Assembly for vote tomorrow
morning.  Please contact members of both houses so that the concerns of the
California business community are clearly heard.

Attached please find the Business Coalitions floor alert, the SVMG's letter
opposing SB67 XX, as well as a spreadsheet with contact information for our
local legislative delegation.  Any effort in this regard will make a
difference.  Thank you for all of your help.

Sincerest Regards,

Carl Guardino

"Covisint Running Out of Excuses to Deliver on Its B2B Promise
By Joe Bousquin 
Staff Reporter
9/13/00 9:09 AM ET 
URL: http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/1076377.html
Uh-oh. Covisint can't blame it on the government anymore. 
When word came Monday that the Federal Trade Commission had green-lighted the 
Big Three automakers' Internet exchange, the business-to-business world 
breathed a collective sigh of relief. That huge cloud of uncertainty, known 
as government intervention, had been lifted. 
Which means Covisint can't blame its state of disarray on the policy wonks 
anymore. Instead, the company will have to execute on its B2B promise -- soon 
-- for positive momentum to continue in the B2B sector. 
The influence of the mega exchange, in which Ford (F:NYSE), General Motors 
(GM:NYSE) and DaimlerChrysler (DCX:NYSE) plan to buy materials and supplies 
on the Internet, has already affected the performance of business-to-business 
stocks. Just look at Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq) on Monday, when Covisint's 
FTC clearance was made public. It shot up $3.75, or 5.3%, to close at $75.13, 
though it had traded as high as $78.13. But Tuesday, after the initial impact 
of Covisint's clearance had waned, so did Commerce One's stock price. It 
closed down $6, or 8%, at $69.12. 
Similarly, when the antitrust issues started creeping onto the B2B scene, and 
the government made known that it was looking at the exchange over antitrust 
concerns, B2B stocks swooned. Now, going forward, how Covisint executes on 
making B2B a reality, and not just the substance of a press release, will 
surely play itself out on B2B stocks. 
Right now, though, the company's prospect for swift and flawless execution of 
its vision doesn't look good. It hasn't named a CEO. It hasn't finalized yet 
where its headquarters will be. And perhaps most important, it has yet to 
hammer out exactly what technology it will run on. 
""Covisint doesn't have a crutch or an excuse anymore,"" says Scott Crompton, 
vice president for global automotive practices at consultant SeraNova. 
""Before, they could lean on the FTC as to why they weren't going forward, but 
now, they're going to have to show some meaningful progress."" 
To date, there has been anything but. In its first few months, the company 
stumbled about nameless, until Covisint was decided upon. That moniker, which 
is meant to evoke the ideals of communication, vision and integration, 
instead elicited visions of corporate wonks sitting around a triangular table 
white-boarding their separate goals. 
All the while, the company had four interim co-CEOs and two competing 
technologies to run on. Because Oracle (ORCL:Nasdaq) had worked with Ford and 
Commerce One with GM before Covisint was announced, the two software firms 
were both brought into the deal. But ever since then, speculation has run 
rampant over whether one firm would push the other out of the picture. 
On Monday, Commerce One's CEO told TheStreet.com that the technology question 
still hadn't been settled, even if the FTC's antitrust ones had. 
Combine all those things and what you've got is the picture of a joint 
venture between three highly competitive companies that's going nowhere fast. 
Or, as Crompton puts it, Covisint is ""three different companies, two 
different technologies and everyone talking about whether there's a lot of 
arguing and infighting."" 
But Covisint's already come up with someone else to blame. Now that the FTC 
has passed, the company says that it's waiting for approval from the 
Bundeskartellamt, or the German equivalent to the FTC. Covisint insists it 
can't even begin operations in the U.S. until it gets the go-ahead from that 
agency. 
""If you were a supplier and I was a manufacturer, both located in San 
Francisco, we could not do business because the Bundeskartellamt still holds 
this control over Covisint,"" says Thomas Hill, a Covisint spokesman. 
""Everyone at Covisint is anxious to start this business. Once the 
Bundeskartellamt gives its blessing, we expect to see Covisint up and running 
in 30 days."" 
Hill concedes that might sound like another excuse for justifying its lack of 
actual operations. 
""Sure, that might seem like another convenient excuse to delay a launch,"" 
Hill said. ""I would say if people could work 25 hours a day to get this done, 
they would. ... Everyone at Covisint is focused on launching in a really 
timely fashion."" 
The company hasn't settled on a headquarters, in part, because it expects its 
yet-to-be-named CEO to have some input into that decision. And as far as that 
CEO goes, Covisint is still looking for one. Again, Hill said it was hard to 
fill the spot when the FTC was probing the endeavor because of the 
uncertainty that it brought with it. 
""If you're a CEO, why would you leave your current job and take the Covisint 
job before the FTC approved it?"" Hill offered. ""And on the other hand, if 
you're the FTC and you see the company you're reviewing hiring people, that 
might make you look a little more closely at what they're doing."" 
Both good points. But the fact remains that Covisint still has a lot more 
work to do to get up and running, and these kinds of challenges tend to take 
more time than expected, not less. And if those challenges become problems 
for the company, the company could become a problem for the entire B2B 
sector, as investors realize all over again how hard it will be to make B2B 
work. 
So the FTC's approval, while good for the ideal of B2B in general, might have 
come a bit early for Covisint and the public B2B companies now trying to show 
real results going forward. 
""My perspective is that this approval from the FTC is very important for the 
industry as a whole, but it shouldn't be a suggestion that Covisint has 
anything wonderful in the works,"" says Ben Smith, a consultant with A.T. 
Kearney. (His firm is a subsidiary of EDS, which formerly was a part of 
General Motors.) ""Now we can move on to execution. But this doesn't suggest 
that Covisint has moved to that stage."" 
Which means investors in B2B should watch the performance of this exchange 
closely. "
"Agree with your suggestion on how to ""re-package"" the solution.  They should 
write and call legislators and the governor and all sign a document endorsing 
it.

Best,
Jeff

version, plus an overview page that answers ""What does this do for:

Also, what is it we want these business leaders to do?  Do we want them to

Subject: TURBOPARK STUFF/CA Development I and II notice of exercise of 
purchase option

I am working on a deal to move TurboPark equipment into Enron owned LLC's, 
with a simultaneous sale of  80% of the equity to a third party.  This deal 
is supposed to close by Jan 15, so I'm getting a crash course on TurboPark 
and how to get stuff out of it during the early phase.  I thought I would 
share what I'm learning, if nothing else as a form of therapy.

Attached to the email is what I believe to be the proper form of notice to 
take something out of TurboPark.  Five to fifteen business days' notice is 
required.

There will be other documents involved as well:

Bill of Sale
Assignment and Assumption Agreement
UCC releases, if applicable (UCC filings are made on all delivered equipment)

I suspect a consent by the equipment seller may also be required.  More to 
come on this one.

As I learn more about the process I will keep you advised.

Subject: CA Development I and II notice of exercise of purchase option

I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase 
option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate 
notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
 
Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
participation agreement and the development and construction management 
agreement.  

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a ""release letter"" for the banks 
and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.

I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.


Thanks,

Kay

Mike - As much as I wanted to come to the June 12th WSPP meeting, a conflict 
arose which I am not able to get out of.  In my absence, I asked Christian 
Yoder to help out (general Enron thoughts) and Randy Osteen (Constellation)  
to speak about the EEI ""Into Product"" if the group wants to understand  a 
little of the history behind it and how the product works (Randy actively 
participated in the review and formulation of the Into Product as well.

Sorry again for missing the meeting.

Talk to you soon.

Stinson,

Here is the 1 factor HJM model for curve simulation originally designed for
a Coal Plant valuation.

This techniques is useful for all kinds of curves, especially when we 
do not have the quality data to estimate other factors. (situations where
only volatility curve is availiable).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

Question 15 of the annual NYMEX hedge exemptions asks us to describe in 
detail:  ""the system of internal controls administered in the supervision of 
the applican't risk management programs, i.e., describe the risk assessment 
policies and procedures in place for evaluation and supervision of risk 
management programs, including ""stress-testing"" for extraordinary price 
volatility, and state frequency supervision is conducted.""

Attached is the response we have given the NYMEX in prior years.  Are there 
any changes in our procedures/control that would necessiate a change in that 
language?

"Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet - so 
I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there if 
there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon to 
discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the techniques 
for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming my life and 
eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys 
and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best 
time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found 
a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked 
away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the 
next month just to get it set up. If you want, you should stop by for a sleep 
over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist 
disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that 
these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely. At least 
that's the excuse I like to give when I come in to work looking like I just 
bathed in a life-sized ashtray. Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out 
why Brooks is doing the chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the 
middle of the night. Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,

Subject: Sexy Body for the New Year!!!


Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell, too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!

"I am surprised that the tax people would be ok with the suggested EOL fix.  My understanding was that if the assignment to ENA from ECTRIC happens automatically, that is equivalent -- for tax purposes -- to the UK trader binding ENA and results in bad tax consequences.

Mark, oh master of EOL - Please see the attached documents forwarded to us from London.  My assumption is that the trades by the hedge funds on EOL will have to be with ECTRIC because of the way EOL is set up.  Is this assumption correct or is there any way to trade UK gas, UK electricity, Brent and metals on EOL directly through ENA?  Thanks, as always, for your input.  Frank

FYI, I just received this e-mail from Janine.  Have you already sorted out the structure with Robyn?  I would like to send an e-mail to Robyn, copying you and Janine with the summary of our discussions from yesterday.

What do you think about the proposed EnronOnline arrangement?

Lara,

a summary of what we just discussed 

Hedge Funds wishing to trade with Enron both OTC and online for products not offered by ENA.

1. OTC transactions will be arranged by originators in the New York office and booked in the name of ENA, and then a transaction will be entered into between ENA and the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC) to transfer the economic position to the relevant Enron affiliate.

2. Online transactions - see Justin's mail below. The suggestion would be that the Hedge Fund does the trade on EOL with the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC). The trade then gets novated from Enron affiliate to ENA. A transaction is then entered into between ENA and Enron affiliate to transfer the economic position. We'll need to work at documentation and process to make this as smooth as possible.

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Subject:	FW: Trades as ENA

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help

all the March deals. This is done to reduce the volume of deals in Sitara so 
that performance

there may be some agreed to changes on the L/C side.  Carol St. Clair is 
addressing that with Jennifer and Miriam.  In any event, I believe that Tiger

Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

John Novak's expat contract expires around March 16th.  As his supervisor, I 
need to tell him what we intend to do with it.  I would like to give him an 
indication sooner rather than later (if we are going to renew, what will be 
the term, etc.?). Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.  ry

"I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point 
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon

has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it

On read access, Rod Nelson from Credit already has Edit access from his days

they should be able to get in.  If they are in Credit we will want them to

Jeff - I know we are a bit tardy in getting back to you. I think a good place to start would be a close review and routine updates on the following:

1. PGT Gas Accord vs. attempt to convert jurisdiction to FERC in bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed, any delay in PG&E's ability to deal with the generators on a long term basis will facilitate bypass projects into the state.

2. Socal - resurrection of GIR or any plans to open the backbone to firm, path based transportation.

3. Southern Trails battle with Socal to gain access to firm takeaway capacity on SoCal's system and developments in Socal's RLS tariff.

4. Any issues that you believe affect our commercial efforts in California.

Obviously this is a small list. I would appreciate your feedback on issues that you believe to be critical drivers.

Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 

To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and ""Hot Button"" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  

I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.

Office of the Chairman:

While traveling within Germany recently, I noticed that electric powered 
trains are popular and also provide a safe, reliable, affordable and 
comfortable means of transportation to the public.

This brought to mind a question to ask you:

Is Enron taking any action to promote development and implementation of 
electric trains or light rail in the USA and/or abroad, either through the 
Political Action Committee, Lobbying or through the efforts of the Business 
Development Offices?

I do believe that the commuters would benefit from having access to electric 
trains that provide safe, clean and comfortable transport. Enron could 
potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA 
(and abroad as well). 

Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for 
commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both 
interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, 
or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. 
With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, 
it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the 
element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel 
are clearly not the solution for mass transit.

    Dear Vince,

    Thank you for agreeing to take part in our annual US congress.
    There were 2 things that I would ideally like you to be involved in.  The 
first
    would be to present any new research you may have.  This would be part of 
stream
    3 (see attached) which looks at new research in derivatives modelling and
    analysis.  If you would like to present any new research that fits into 
the
    rough areas outlined that would be great.
    The second would be part of a panel discussion on weather derivatives 
(number 44
    attached).  I have also invited Jeff Porter (Koch) and Ravi Nathan 
(Aquila).
    Please let me know if you would like to present any new research and/or 
take
    part in the panel.

    i look forward to hearing from you soon.

    Best regards,

"Attached is a first draft of the swap for the Raptor 2 structure.  Please 
consider the following questions and I will amend the confirmation 
accordingly:

1.  I have bracketed the concept of multiple notices for purposes of multiple 
partial terminations and therefore multiple Valuation Dates.  Before we 
eliminate this concept, I just want to make certain that everyone is in 
agreement as to how this swap will terminate.  [Do we want partial 
terminations based upon partial asset sales?]

2.  Assuming that termination occurs upon sale of 100% of the assets, I need 
to be sure that the word ""sale"" is sufficient.  Should we use ""financial 
close"" or some other term of art?  I have concerns that a sale may be 
contingent or subject to some waiting period.

"Hi Charlotte,

I'm glad you wrote, as I was going to write you.

Michael has strep (as do I), so he and I are home today.  He is on two 
antibiotics which he takes twice a day.  I'm trying to figure out how to get 
these to you, since these have to be refrigerated.  Obviously, if Michael  
isn't doing great I won't go.  Currently, he feels fine, and only feels bad 
when he has fever. He woke up with fever again this am, but the fever should 
go away after 24 hours on the antibiotics.  Just let me know if you aren't 
comfortable with  the situation.  I can always leave on Saturday, or not at 
all.

Michael's doctor is Rey Calderon 713 520 9550.  His wife (and assistant) is 
Delores, and they are wonderful about returning calls, etc.

We will be staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, 210 647 1234. Saturday

Hi Dutch,
 
No, all he said was that he hadn't been given instructions as of yet (7:50).  I've just called him again (9:05), and he said that he was told that there would be no money transfered either way???
 
Thanks!

Subject: Order Instituting Rulemaking to Establish Policies and Cost
Recovery Mechanisms for Generation Procurement


On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday). 

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week so
that I can send in the required letter.

		 Subject: Missing Tariff Numbers on HPL Annual Report



Dan:  The following sales contracts were listed on the HPL Annual Report 
without a tariff number.  

Would you review the following information and advise as to whether a sales 
tariff filing is required.  It appears that the transactions related to these 
sales contracts took place prior to the time the contracts were assigned to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  Let me know if the tariffs we prepared to respond 
to the Auditors query, should truly be included with our November 10th TRRC 
Tariff Filing Report..

Contract #96022611:  H&D Operating Company - Gas Lift Sales:  Delivery period 
01/99 Invoiced 9/10/99; Delivery period 02/99 Invoiced 10/12/99.   HPL needs 
sales tariff for period after assignment.

Contract #96019866:  OXY USA. Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract: Delivery 
period 03/99; Demand Charge Invoiced 3/26/99.  Why shouldn't this be under 
the transport tariff for this transport imbalance.

Contract #96022610: Preferred Pipeline Company - GTC Sale Spot: Delivery 
period 01/99 and 02/99; Invoiced 08/27/99. Who issued the GTC, if HPL, then 
HPL needs to file a sales tariff.

Contract #96019865: Texcol Gas Services Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract 
(Contract was set up per Tommy Yanowski relating to the imbalance on 
Terminated Transport Agreement 12-88974-204  (311a2(284C)Offshore Tx); 
Delivery period 02/99; Invoiced 03/25/99. Cashout under 311transport should 
not require a tariff filing, however, it may require a FERC filing.

Contract #9600821: HPL Resources Company - Master Purchase Sale Firm.
Delivery period 01/99, Invoiced 02/12/99
Delivery period 02/99, Invoiced 03/24/99
Delivery period 04/99, Invoiced 06/10/99; 09/10/99

Do you know when this contract came back to HPL and should the tariff reflect 
activity that took place prior to when it was assigned to HPL?  This 
information should be in the contract file.  The tariff should not  reflect 
activity prior to the time the contract was assigned to HPL.
 
I will need to get final information to Carla Nguyen by Monday October 30 so 
she can make the appropriate notations to the annual report pages 31a2, 31a3 
and 31a4.

Thanks for all your help!

Subject: Roundtable

Dear Kay,

Confirming our discussion, The Texas Lawyer has asked King & Spalding to
organize a Roundtable Discussion of lawyers and business people to discuss
how the two professions relate to each other in the context of complex
business transactions. 

The Roundtable would take place privately in a conference room in our
offices with a court reporter recording the discussion, which would then be
published in an upcoming issue of the newspaper. Participants will have the
opportunity to edit their remarks before they are published. John Cogan will
be co-chairman of the proceedings with our partner, Chris LaFollette.  I
unfortunately cannot attend as I will be out of town. 

The Discussion will take place on Thursday, March 15, from 2 to 3:30. We
will hold a planning session over lunch in one of our conference rooms from
12:30 to 2. No other preparation would be required.

You would be a terrific representative from Enron to join us and provide
Enron's perspective. Please confirm your attendance as soon as you get the
internal approvals by calling John Cogan at 713.276.7371 or by e-mail at
jcogan@kslaw.com.

Best regards,
John

Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this
Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very
anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by
binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large
exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to
discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

Subject: Sr. Director Position

Vince:  As you requested, I have obtained some information from Norma 
relating to the salary parameters of the Sr. Director position.   The minimum 
salary is $83,800, and the maximum is $168,000 (huge range, isn't it?).   
However, Norma did ask me to bring a couple of things to your attention:  the 
lowest salary of a VP in your group is currently $140,000, and the average 
director's salary in your group is $120,000.    Those numbers narrow the 
range considerably.   Of course, there is no equity issue since there is no 
other senior director in your group.

Hope this information helps,
Molly

"Jeff,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

Dear Vincent,

As I told you on the phone on Friday, I am very interested in a summer
internship at Enron. I would like to point out that I want to pursue a
career in trading, and I am especially interested in derivatives. Given that
Enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy, broadband and weather
derivatives, I find it a company I would be most interested in working for.

I believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm, and I
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours. I have
final exams from March 19-22, but would be most willing to travel to Houston
for interviews any time from Friday March 23rd onwards. I hope to hear from
you soon.

"Holli:

We need to talk about status.
I spoke yesterday with three EWEB lawyers and Dick Varner.
I have to comment back on the Schedule to the master agreement.  EWEB has not 
yet reviewed the Credit Support Annex and needs to submit their proposed 
legal opinion.  EWEB is reserving discussion of the confirmations pending 
resolution of the master agreement.

Most important, however, is the EWEB legal opinion which will be limited by 
the capacity of EWEB's traders to enter into financial trades at any given 
point in time.  EWEB is insisting that we assume the obligation of knowing 
whether an EWEB trader is authorized to act and how that EWEB trader is 
authorized to act under EWEB's trading policy because, under Oregon law (and 
the law of all states), financial trades executed by unauthorized persons 
(employed by governmental entities) are completely void.  

Your two trades (which began as physical deals and were transformed into 
financial deals) were authorized by EWEB's recent board resolution.  However, 
you cannot rely fully on this resolution for future trades.  Before you ever 
trade with EWEB again, you will not be able to rely upon your past 
relationship with an EWEB trader.  You will first have to conduct some due 
diligence with respect to the EWEB trader and the EWEB trading policy.

ENA has never agreed to this type of arrangement.

Let's schedule a time to discuss the agreement further.  Thanks.  Sara "

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back

Carlos -

The documents attached to the ConEd message here are their draft Electric & 
Gas Cost Reimbursement Agreements.  They cover the costs of grid 
interconnection for any site we might develop in ConEd's territory.  
Apparently, Gary Keevil of East Coast Power has been handling discussions 
with ConEd to this point, but with East Coast Power out of the picture, I'm 
picking it up.

Kathleen has coached me on questions about these documents.  First, do we 
have a Confidentiality Agreement with ConEd that covers these power 
development project discussions?  She's going to ask Stephen Plauche of 
Origination about this, but I'm betting we don't have one.

Second, are these agreements ""Turbo Park"" compliant, and have we set up an 
LLC to deal with New York development projects yet?  I understand Herman 
Manus is the expert on this topic.

Finally, what are the legal sticking points in these documents?  ConEd has 
called an informational meeting for next Tuesday, May 1st, for these 
documents.  I'm planning to attend.  I'd like to know by then what we like 
and don't like about them, and how to approach possible changes.

I'll call you later this morning so we can discuss how to proceed.

Subject: Draft Legislative Language


	

We have seen an early release of legislative language.  It is SB 1433 
Alpert/Davis.

1.  It institutes a rate cap of 6.5 cents/kWh for residential and small 
commercial retroactive to June 2000 through December 31, 2002.  It leaves the 
ability for the Commission to extend to 2003 if in the public interest.  (We 
will strike the last part.)

Small commercial customers are all accounts on Schedule A, all accounts who 
are general acute care hospitals, public and private k-12 schools and all 
accounts on AL-TOU (up through 6000 kWh/billing period)

2.  Provides an opt-in provision for large commercial/agricultural/industrial 
customers with an annual true-up.

The sense I got was that CMTA/CLECA may have asked for this.  It gives 
legislative cover.  Will be difficult to administer and the true-up will 
discourage sign up. 

Please let me know if you agree.

3.  Provides that overcollections of PPA/QFs/SONGs will be used to offset 
undercollections of cap.

Our comment is that the overcollections, on a pro-rata basis will be used to 
offset the cap.  All customers pay stranded costs associated with those 
contracts, all customers should receive stranded benefits.

4.  SDG&E is still subject to reasonableness review by the Commission.  To 
the extent FERC orders refunds as part of its investigation, such refunds 
will go to SDG&E's customers.

Not too bad.

On Wednesday, June 14th I attended your presentation entitled ""THE CHALLENGE
OF VALUATION OF ENERGY RELATED DERIVATIVES"" at the Risk 2000 conference in
Boston.  Can you please e-mail me the slides you presented.

Also, you mentioned that the method you used to calculate volatility for
energy prices was not the ""normal"" method.  Can you please tell me, or give

I've taken a quick look at these and think that they are really more in the physical trading line than derivatives.  I'm trying to figure out who the physical metals trading lawyer is to take a look at them for you.

I am forwarding initial documents concerning an inventory finance transaction. 

Mark, I am distributing to your attention since the structure involves the buying/selling of inventory in a trading arrangement, and the documents are in some respects derived from an ISDA format. While this is a ""financing"" with a bank, and hence my involvement, there are trading aspects here as well. [Mike Robison is reviewing from the EWS business unit perspective.]If someone in your group should review, please advise.

Justin, I am distributing to your attention, since the choice of law is English, and you were involved in the prior Metals transaction that this is derived from. If someone else in London should review, please advise.

For ease of review, I also attach:

1 the Master Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal

 <<00300601_EnronCorp_DES.doc>> 

2 the Forward Sale Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical

 <<REVISED3.DOC>> 

3 the Agency Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal
Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001);

 <<PhysMstrvAgency.doc>> 


Please note the following:

1. General

- I have drafted the agency and forward sale aspects previously contained in
the physical metal Master Agreement in separate agreements. In order to
ensure that these agreements are as distinct as possible, certain elements
of the physical metal Master Agreement (for example, conditionality of
Transactions/Call Options on hedging) may have to be included in a separate
side letter. 
- To the extent that I have insufficient details in relation to this
transaction, I have retained the structure of the physical metal Master
Agreement.
- These drafts have not been reviewed by Enron and therefore remain subject
to their comments.

2. Master Agreement

- As the Commodities will not be exchange traded, I have introduced the
concepts of ""Reference Price"" and ""Pricing Date"", which are similar to those
contained in the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions.
- Enron would like to be able to enter into Transactions/exercise Call
Options on non-Business Days.
- I have, where possible, avoided referring to the Agency Agreement and the
Forward Sale Agreement. However, one aspect of the Agency Agreement that
does remain in the Master Agreement is that of ""Agency Costs"", which is, in
some instances, an intrinsic element of pricing. This will need to be
discussed.
- I have removed the concept of ""Minimum Value"", which I understand will not
form part of this transaction.
- I understand that, due to the nature of the Commodities, there may be an
imbalance in the quantity sold and that delivered. Although the consequences
of this need to be discussed, I have introduced provisions to cater for this
(see Clauses 4.3 and 5.5.5).

3. Forward Sale Agreement

- I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible from the
Agency and the Master Agreements.
- The pricing of the forwards needs to be discussed.
- I have removed ""Credit Support Default"" as an Event of Default.

4. Agency Agreement

- As with the Master and Forward Sale Agreements, I have attempted to make
this agreement as distinct as possible.


I look forward to discussing your comments and working with you on this
transaction.

Kind regards

Free Seminar: ""Optimization Model for Capital Investment Decisions
Using Option Pricing"", by INFORMS President John Birge

You are invited to attend a free, 45-minute online seminar on
""Optimization model for capital investment decisions using option
pricing"".

When: Wednesday, July 19, at 2:00 PM EDT

Where: Right from your desktop! You can participate using your office
computer and telephone.

How: <http://www.e-optimization.com/resources/web_realoptions.cfm>

Real-option valuation incorporates the opportunities a company may enjoy
using either new knowledge or changes in the marketplace for making
capital investments. The talk focuses on optimization models for
determining best investment levels and demonstrates how stochastic
(involving random variables) programs consider risk without creating
unwieldy formulations. Hear how Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and General
Motors are using this process successfully.

INFORMS President John Birge, Dean of the McCormick School of
Engineering and Applied Science at the Northwestern University in
Illinois, will give the seminar. John is a popular author and speaker
and during the past five years has been in demand for his talks on
stochastic programming and optimization.

Who should attend: OR analysts, strategic planners, financial analysts,
consultants and financial decision makers or anyone interested in
hearing about innovative, exciting, practical decision-making tools.

		 Subject: Re: P&G

I am copying Sara on this b/c I would be interested in her input if she has a 
different take than I do.

I understand your message to mean that P&G is offering a representation from 
them that they will strictly adhere to their corporate derivatives policy 
(with a copy of the policy attached to the contract), and, in exchange for 
this, they would like the ""No Reliance"" representation deleted entirely.

I don't really see how such a representation helps us with the ""No Reliance"" 
problem.   The CFTC has ruled that in a dealer/customer context, if the 
customer relies on the dealer's expertise in entering into a trade, then the 
trade may be unenforceable against the customer.  The legal principle is one 
of fiduciary duty and doesn't really have anything to do with corporate 
authorization.  In other words, the fact that the trade is authorized does 
not change the fact that the customer is relying on the dealer's superior 
knowledge.

In its 1996 lawsuit with Bankers Trust, Procter & Gamble unwound an interest 
rate swap position when they ended up about $200 million out of the money.  
P&G argued that they were relying on BT due to BT's superior expertise in 
interest rate markets, and therefore P&G shouldn't have to pay.  The issue of 
whether or not P&G was authorized to enter into the swaps was not an issue at 
all in that case, nor would it be an issue, in my opinion, if P&G sought to 
unwind a pulp and paper swap with us based on our alleged superior expertise 
in pulp and paper markets.

The danger of having positions unwound has made the ""No Reliance"" clause one 
of the most important clauses in the ISDA for us.  I will look at and 
consider any particular language they may wish to propose, but conceptually, 
we can not trade with counterparties who wish to rely on our market expertise 
in deciding whether to enter into a trade. -- Bob

Bob,

P&G business contact mentioned that they have inserted the following into 
their ISDA schedules:

1) a clause that states that P&G will strictly adhere to their corporate 
derivatives policy (that covers deal terms, hedged risks, etc.) and append 
the ISDA with the corporate policy....

Is this something we can consider???  Policy spells out types of deals they 
can and can't enter...therefore, they can't sue us (hopefully) if they have 
followed their policy guidelines...

Thanks.

With Maury's work schedule, I bet that he will be unable to make the dinner,  
so I need to decide if I am going to or not. ?But, we would like to come for  
the wedding. ?That is either asking you to help us with the kids...all of  
them, or ... helping us find enough sitters for them if you have plans. ? 
Steve has offered to keep Carolyn, and if we come just the night, I might do  
that. ??It is just a hard decision to make. ?She is still so young. 

Anyway, please see if this conflicts with anything. ?The other option would  
be to stay at John and Yvonne's....or leave the boys there...and Maury and I  
stay with Carolyn at the Houstonian. ?We do not want to impose....and I know  
that I am asking alot. 

Easter sounds good to us. ?There was a chance that Maury's sister was  
coming...but they just found out they owe alot in Taxes....so cancelled. ?We  
will probably go on down on Thursday night since we are off on Good Friday. ? 
There is a big event in San Antonio that I plan to take the kids to. ?I 
think  
it will be at 1:00...so we will plan to be gone on that day. ?Which will 
give  
some breathing room for whoever is there. ?There is this huge egg hunt at 
the

better than any country club egg hunt. ?Just fun. ?So we will go there and  
come back for the night.

grocery shop for everyone.....and split it down there. ?What do you feel 
like  
having.

like to determine if ETS and/or NBP would want to send a representative(s), 
although Margaret said she would take copious notes for distribution to other 
key players as necessary.  We should ask Nesbitt how he would structure a 
deal for multiple clients (eg. ETS, NBP, ENA, and maybe El Paso).  

[We need to remain aware of any ""affiliate"" issues that may result, and make 
certain that we are in complete compliance with the regs.]

I will wait until after our meeting with Nesbitt before deciding if/how to 
approach El Paso.  Presumably, if asked to particpate, they would share the 
cost and have independent access to any working model that is developed.

John,

I talked to Dale Nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his 
model is to
go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his 
company.
Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase 
price of $55,000,
in case we buy the software package.

The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required 
level of support.

Dale will be in Houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit 
with us on Tuesday,
November 7, at 3:00 p.m. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.


Please, let me know what you think.

Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power 
volatilities and correlations

As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power 
traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option 
portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that 
the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in 
their mark.

In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light. 
Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as 
this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a 
matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you 
may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the 
deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. 

The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue 
for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at 
the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot 
use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise 
options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any 
way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the 
few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' 
piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of 
worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the 
correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) 
the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  
underlying. 

They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel 
who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most 
experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). 
This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of 
Enron's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the 
volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that 
different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value 
the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns 
over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it 
does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc 
calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike 
price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the 
forward price of the underlying itself. 

We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in 
Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start 
to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.

Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or 
gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no 
there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure 
given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what 
the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have 
Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega 
or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to 
work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like 
to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem 
(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the 
implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current 
system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we 
validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?

Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher 
volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their 
VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily 
remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol 
curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any 
testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). 
The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the 
impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.

I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing 
the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been 
covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having 
to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and 
are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies 
of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have 
not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in 
gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that 
it is not for a lack of trying.

Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived 
inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.

James

Subject: Intergen Deal - Meeting

Kay and I would like to get together tomorrow (Wednesday) morning to discuss 
the Intergen transaction.  Specifically, we would like to discuss: 1) the 
steps/timeline associated with assigning the equipment from TurboPark to 
Intergen, and 2) the accounting condition(s) required to be satisfied in 
order for the transaction value to be booked as 2000 earnings.

Intergen is holding a Board meeting this afternoon and the Enron/Intergen 
transaction is on the agenda for approval.   We expect to hear the results of 
that Board meeting sometime tomorrow morning.  If Intergen receives Board 
approval to proceed, our current goal is to have the transaction documents in 
a final form for signing on Thursday of this week.  This would allow us to 
notify TurboPark on Thursday or Friday of our intent to assign the equipment 
to Intergen.  It is unclear if this assignment can be accomplished by 12/29.

Kay has a meeting at 10 am.  Can we me at 8:30 or 9:00 a.m.?  Call/email me 
to confirm the time and location of this meeting.

Thanks,
Fred

Subject: California Update 07.18.01

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very 
difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's 
going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of 
the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two ""informational"" hearings that ""this is 
it,"" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the 
committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill 
tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the 
Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with 
Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the 
amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the ""July 12"" date changed to ""the effective date of 
the bill"" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the 
earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each 
approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the 
night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and 
Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a ""fair"" bill); 
the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; 
they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit 
down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin 
talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given 
Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

Best,
Jeff

was made the end of March.  Your credit card expired March, 2001.  So, you 
are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged.  I'm going to go 
ahead and expense this charge and then you'll need to pay it.  If you want it 
set up again on your credit card, you have to send Cingular a letter stating 
your wishes.

I also changed your address to this building while I had her on the phone.

Dear Justin

Marly asked me to respond to you.

As you know, the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many
companies. Therefore, any trade mark registration that incorporates the word
ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to
prevent others from using the word ONLINE.

Given the above, if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON (which
covers the services that you offer on-line as well as your core activities),
I'd say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably
unnecessary. However, if you use a particular logo for the on-line service,
that should be registered.

I hope the above is clear.

Jonathan Day

		 Subject: Fwd:Ford chairman calls climate change world's #1 issue


Joe and Tom:  Either Bill Ford is a major Democrat or this signals a major 
shift which serves as a strong indicator that Congress will face new 
pressures next Congress to address Global Warming.  This is truly a 
remarkable speech.

FORD PREDICTS END OF CAR POLLUTION
The Independent (UK)
6 October 2000

Internet:
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/UK/Environment/2000-10/ford061000.shtml

The 100-year reign of the polluting internal combustion engine is coming to
an end, Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday. It
will soon be replaced in motor vehicles by the hydrogen fuel cell, which
emits no pollution whatsoever and so can reduce the build-up of greenhouse
gases causing climate change, Mr. Ford, great-grandson of the company's
founder, Henry Ford, told the Greenpeace Business Conference in London.

In a remarkable speech from a motor manufacturer, in which he proclaimed his
own environmental credentials, Mr. Ford, 43, accepted that the automobile had
had a serious negative impact on the environment, and that his industry had
wrongly played down the threat from global warming.  And the head of the
world's second biggest car company raised eyebrows even further when he said
that he could foresee the day when people would not want to own cars, but
merely have access to mobility.

Detroit-born Mr. Ford, who has been chairman since the start of last year,
proclaimed that climate change was the most challenging issue facing the
world and that anyone who disagreed was ""in denial"". Ford itself had moved on
from that position, he said. But he felt the Kyoto protocol, the 1997 pact in
which the industrialised nations agreed to try to limit their emission of
greenhouse gases, would not provide deep enough cuts to halt global warming.
Only the marketplace, making new technology widely available, could tackle
the problem.

A fuel cell creates energy by an electrochemical process similar to that in a
battery: it lets hydrogen and oxygen react together to produce electricity
and water vapour. It does not run down or need recharging, working as long as
the hydrogen fuel is available, but most importantly, it does not produce any
CO2, the basic by-product of any carbon-based fuel such as oil, gas or coal.
Every major car company in the world is throwing huge sums into developing
the technology: Ford is spending $1bn (?690m) between now and 2004, while
Daimler-Chrysler, regarded as the leader in the field, has spent $700m. All
the main manufacturers have prototype fuel-cell cars running and there is a
race to bring them to market. Honda and Toyota expect to do so in 2003, while
Ford and Daimler-Chrysler are aiming at 2004.

""I believe fuel cells will finally end the 100-year reign of the internal
combustion engine,"" Mr. Ford said, adding that the technology was ""the holy
grail"" of the motor industry. Prophesying the demise of car ownership, he
said:  ""The day will come when the whole notion of car ownership is
antiquated,"" he said. Mr. Ford was reflecting advanced motor industry
thinking, which suggests many people might not want to pay for a car of their
own if they could be guaranteed mobility on demand from a local hire network.

I am pleased to announce that Terry Franklin will be joining the 
Transportation Rates team in a newly created position-the Appalachian 
Coordinator role.  Terry brings years of transportation, wellhead, and Enron 
experience to the position, and we are excited to have her join the team.

In her new position, Terry will be responsible for the following:

? Understand the Appalachian contracts/agreements
? Understand the gas flow methods and desired commercial results
? Facilitate set-up of transport/gathering contracts
? Facilitate set-up of facilities/meters
? Create purchase deals in SITARA
? Maintain transport rates coordination role for CGAS, CNG, CNR, etc.
? Review calc sheets
? Maintain purchase pricing
? Maintain intra-month volumetric estimates on CNR/Gather co

Terry will make every effort to trouble shoot and problem solve for both the 
commercial and operations teams.  In doing so, she will be looking to partner 
with the members of the Trading, Origination, Client Services, Volume 
Management, and Logistics teams to improve our processes in this very 
important area.   

Terry will be replaced on the Operational Analysis team, but we may choose to 
realign individual responsibilities to creatively manage the  current 
workload.  Terry will begin to transition over the next several days, but we 
must be very careful to maintain the current Volume Mgmt. OA process during 
this transition time.

Please join me in congratulating Terry in her new role!

SUBJECT:
MARGIN RATE CHANGE: FEBRUARY, MARCH, AND APRIL 2001 CONTRACTS ONLY

Effective Date:  Friday, January 19, 2001 (close of business).
Futures Contract: Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures.
Contract Months: February, March, and April 2001 Contracts Only.
Rate Change:

NYMEX Division Margins for the February and March 2001
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts Only

Effective Date:  Friday, January 19, 2001 (close of business).

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin): Old:  $14,000  New:  $12,000
Member Customer (Initial Margin): Old:  $15,400  New:  $13,200
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin): Old:  $18,900  New:  $16,200

NYMEX Division Margins for the April 2001
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract Only

Effective Date:  Friday, January 19, 2001 (close of business.)
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin): Old:  $5,000   New:  $6,000
Member Customer (Initial Margin): Old:  $5,500   New:  $6,600
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin): Old:  $6,750   New:  $8,100

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by 
first determining the ""Scan Risk"" and then multiplying the number of spreads 
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the 
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Note the outright margin 
level required for the February and March 2001 contracts, the April 2001 
contract, and all subsequent contracts differ.  Spreading between differently 
margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than between equally 
margined contracts.  Below are provided three spread scenarios where the legs 
of the spread are margined differently.

Scenario One
A spread consisting of one leg in either the February 2001 or March 2001 
contracts and another in the April 2001 contract will have its requirement 
(at the clearing member rates) calculated at $8,500 starting on Friday, 
January 19, 2001.

Example at Clearing Member Rates
One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG (1 x $12,000) =    $12,000
One Short April 2001 NG   (1 x $6,000) =-   $6,000
Net Scan Risk    ($12,000-$6,000)=    $6,000
Spread Rate    (1x $2,500) =+   $2,500
Total Requirement     =    $8,500

Scenario Two
A spread consisting of one leg in either the February 2001 or March 2001 
contracts and another in any month following the April 2001 contract will 
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $9,500 
starting on Friday, January 19, 2001.

Example at Clearing Member Rates
One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG (1 x $12,000) = $12,000
One Short May 2001 - January 2004 NG (1 x $5,000) =      -$5,000
Net Scan Risk    ($12,000-$5,000)= $7,000
Spread Rate    (1x $2,500) =      +$2,500
Total Requirement    =        $  9,500
Scenario Three
A spread consisting of one leg in the April 2001 contract and another in any 
month following the April 2001 contract will have its requirement (at the 
clearing member rates) calculated at $3,500 starting on Friday, January 19, 
2001.
Example at Clearing Member Rates
One Long April 2001 NG          (1 x $6,000)    =        $  6,000
One Short May 2001 - January 2004 NG       (1 x $5,000)    =   -     $  5,000
Net Scan Risk                         ($6,000-$5,000)  =        $  1,000
Spread Rate                          (1x $2,500)     =   +     $  2,500
Total Requirement                                 =        $  3,500

Summary of NYMEX Division Margins on Natural Gas Futures Spreads
Scenario One: February or March 2001 Contracts versus the April 2001 Contract
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):               $  8,500
Member Customer (Initial Margin):                   $  9,350
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):               $11,475
Scenario Two: February or March 2001 Contracts versus Contracts following the 
April 2001 Contract
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):               $  9,500
Member Customer (Initial Margin):                   $10,450

Steve,

Thanks for your courtesy this morning, and recommendations for further 
contacts.  (By copy of this transmission I'm sending my resume' on to Rick, 
Jose' and Miguel, as you suggested.)  Much of the work I've done in the last 
fifteen years has been involved government affairs, in one way or another.  
Either I was dealing with state and federal regulatory agencies in the US, 
working on political campaigns in Florida and Texas, or negotiating with 
international governments preparing for purchase of utility concessions.  All 
while developing strategy, building and organizing teams to execute the work, 
and seeing to it that the job got done.

Three documents are attached.  I suggest this order to read them: 
#1 ""JPO Res Addendum"" gives you a view looking forward (where I'll go, what I 
can do) as all resumes should.
#2 ""JPO Res Exec Summ"" gives you a view looking back (where I've been, what 
I've done) as all resumes would.
#3 ""JPO Res Full CV"" gives detail on specific assignments and projects 
(essentially an expanded version of #2).


Hope the holidays are joyous and safe for all.

Best regards,

J. Paul

Chris, Greg is putting the finishing touches on the Power Master as well as a 
GTC.

Greg, Chris needs the Master form ASAP so we can take the lead on this 
Ontario industry form development iniative.  Can you finalize the form and 
prepare a bullet point memo as requested by Chris comparing the differences 
between our form and EEI.

Greg, also you should coordinate a Calgary office meeting with traders and 
originators (not more than 1 hour) to unveil and explain the form ASAP.  
Alberta Market Opening and PPA trading commences Jan 1/01 and we may need 
push to get Masters signed or rely on GTC in the short term.

Chris, you should do likewise in Toronto when appropriate.

Milly, would it be a worthwhile expense for Greg to attend the firstOntario 
industry meeting in Toronto with Chris, as Greg has the background on 
developing the form?

Mark and Elizabeth, FYI.

Peter.

Subject: Power Master

Greg - Sorry to keep bothering you on the Power Master, but I was wondering 
what is the ETA for the form?  The reason I ask is that I am going to be 
involved in the industry push here in Ontario to develop a standard physical 
bilateral agreement.  While it is my understanding that many participants 
want to start with the EEI form and OPGI believes that they already have a 
next to final form, for obvious reasons Peter and Milly would like to see our 
form become the industry standard.

Another thing that would be helpful is a brief memo describing the 
differences between the EEI form and our form and the rationale for the 
differences.  Some of this may be readily apparent from running a blackline, 
but I would like to have the benefit of the knowledge you have built up in 
developing the form.  

Timing of this is fairly tight as the next meeting on this initiative is 
November 9th.  My goal is to show up at the meeting and advocate a 
""Canadianized"" version of the EEI form and then describe the great time and 
effort Enron has expended on this already and table our draft as a starting 
point.

Apparently EEI will also be in attendance.  I will follow up with Elizabeth 
Sager on what is the status of our relationship with EEI and what was the US 
experience in developing the EEI master.

Regards
CJG

"Wilson,

We are running short on time.  We are planning to sign on  Tuesday, and I hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date. Would it be easier to work with reps/warranties?

I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability  (2) obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.

Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same  under this agreement?  Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for consequentials (absent a waiver)?  

Your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly appreciated.

Kay

Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could
really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Dear Sara,

Just a quick note this month because I know a lot of you are on
vacation or traveling this time of year.  There have been a lot
of exciting things going on at Netstock, but to keep things short
I will only mention a few:

In response to your requests, we will be adding over 1,000 new

Soon you'll have over 3,000 securities to choose from to help
diversify your portfolio!  Some of the recently added ShareBuilder

and click on 'ShareBuilder Stock List'.

There is also another change that I=0F'd like to mention, that affects
some ShareBuilders.  Rather than send an email to you for every
dividend reinvestment, we will now automatically post your dividend
reinvestment information to your monthly statement.  You can also
find this information under the =0F`Account=0F' tab on

should be added to the confirmations but other than that there are no other

as an aside I noted in the database that it appears that a little over a year

Brent,  we have an ISDA with this company (executed early 1998).  Does it 
need any modifications in order to trade weather derivatives under it?  I'm 
not sure if the standard ISDA works or if it  needs an amendment for special

Jeff:

Following is a summary of recent EPMI West Power activity with the 3 
California utilites

PG&E - EEI Master Agreement in place.  As part of their recent RFP, we 
completed 2, 50 MW,  5 year, sale transactions for peak hours at $58.40 and 
$58.70.  They are looking at EOL although they have not transacted on it.  
They call regularly for shorter dated quotes.  We deal with Claudia Grief who 
works in Joe Henri's group.  Overall, we have a very positive relationship 
and look forward to increasing business.

Edison - Almost finished negotiation of a EEI Master Agreement to allow 
transactions.  We are haggling about some credit issues, but expect these to 
be resolved shortly.  We participated in their only RFP.   They did not 
transact with us or, to our knowledge, with others. They got cold feet.   We 
work with Jill Horswell, Sean Baker and Bennie Wu.  Since master contracts 
are not done yet, and no deals have been completed, I would say this 
relationship is not as good as PG&E but better than SDG&E.  I would expect 
that we will be doing regular cash business by the end of the year.  They are 
looking at EOL.

SDG&E - We have participated in 3 RFPs and have not been successful.  We have 
been trying to sell them longer dated energy (5 years).  We believe they have 
bought from others but for small size and limited duration.  We work with 
Sharon Firooz.  We have sent them master EEI agreements and are not making as 
much progress in getting them to agree.  They prefer using the  WSPP contract 
rather than EEI.  We hate WSPP.  We will keep pounding on them until they see 
the light but it will likely take longer.  Plus they are far more skittish 
re: longer dated transactions thatn the other utilites.  This said, I would 
be surprised if we were not transacting with them on shorter term deals by Q1 
2001.  They are not using EOL.

Please let me know if this summary meets your needs 503/464-3822.

Vince,

  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse
the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.
I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure
this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain
why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk
more about this.

  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the
East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports
to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at
the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.
It effectively kills off the development of risk management at
the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less
profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated
prices.

  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative
form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces
price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just
get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service
regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service
prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.

  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources
of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side
involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A
necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect
actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power
exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market
participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM
model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any
significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

Frank"

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own
crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite
DWR contracts and DA ""stampede""), which should leave one to believe
that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which
further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that
DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.

Jeff
CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority)
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority
has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to
approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the
Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until
its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until
the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has
been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection
of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to
exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or
to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's
credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized
the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent
to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as
well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power
Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of
electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a
net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric
generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have
no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve
customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts
and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply
shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through
Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand
side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer 
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power
Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry
currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the
past for the New York Power Authority.

Mark

Not sure of your exact email address but hopefully one of these is correct.
Can you please confirm that you receive this?

Below is the agreement our attorneys have drafted for the transfer of the
www.weather-desk.com domain name.  Note that they have recommended that a
few of the more specific details regarding the corresponding Enron usage of
the RMS weather model be addressed in a simple but separate license
agreement.   As discussed, in addition to general confidentialiy
provisions, those terms will include (1) the access will not cover any
international weather data that may be added to the system during the term
of use through December 31, as our costs associated with such data are
uncertain and (2) the use of the model will be for Enron internal purposes
only with no data or analysis results to be shared with third parties.

I would appreciate if you can forward this to your legal dept. to review so
that we can hopefully get this resolved quickly.

Thanks/regards

Paul

I've changed three Short Term West Hourly deals to reflect what all parties 
have agreed to - EPMI sells to Sierra Pacific Holding Co., HE 23-24 on 4/28, 
HE 1-24 on 4/29, and HE 1-6 on 4/30. Instead of selling to the Automated

and selling to Sierra Pacific. Following are the changed deal numbers, for

I believe this should clear up any discrepancies we had among different

		 Subject: DRAFT presentation--Status report on California

Attached is the draft that we've discussed.  Few points:

It's a draft.  It would benefit from more tinkering.
It takes our core messages (what's the problem?  what's the solution?) and 
tries to weave in current events, understanding that by the time you're 
giving the presentation it may need to be further modified to correspond with 
rapidly changing circumstances and events.
It's frank but (hopefully) measured in describing the mess that is 
California.  It's set up so that it's easy to modify the more pointed 
statements.
Leaves plenty of room for you to tailor the presentation to particular points 
that you'd like to make, or data and/or information that you'd like to 
include.
I didn't have ready access to charts and graphs to back up the stats used in 
the text of the presentation, but I'm sure that it will be relatively easy 
for someone in Houston to pull that together (e.g., may want to poach a bit 
from Belden's presentation to include some PNW hydro stats (which I've also 
attached), or from ISO website to show load-resource balance info).
Though I'll be on vacation, I'll be checking in on voicemail and email, so if 
you have any questions, or need something additional to get the presentation 
ready, just let me know.
I may be in an airplane on Monday during both the leadership call and the 
newly restructured California call.  Otherwise, I'll be trying to make those 
calls dailywhile I'm away. 
And Jim, I'll also be available to participate in any calls regarding 
Calger's proposed deal with CDWR.
Finally, when the darn thing prints out, it prints borders around the 
heading/title box and the text box, though I don't know why.  Tried just 
about everything to get rid of them.  May want to have a PP guru in Houston 
see if (s)he can disable the boders.
Best,
Jeff

"Once I get the draft I will set up a conference call with the people who can 
provide the input on the document.  If it would be better to have the call 
before let me know, and I will try to set it up.  I'm free tomorrow am if 
that is a good time for you.

		 Subject: Trading Edge / Bond Link Agreement

The IT Contract group has been involved in reviewing documents for Trading 
Edge's Bond Link online bond trading site.  George Weber, who has since moved 
into another area, discussed various issues with Trading Edge early this 
year.  Laine Borgman, a contract administrator in the IT Contracts group, has 
become involved in the Trading Edge review during the past week.  Attached 
below are Trading Edge agreements and their responses to issues raised by IT 
Contracts.  

The primary issues Laine and I discussed yesterday are as follows:

Jurisdiction:   
Our preference is Texas, but we would accept New York.  Trading Edge's 
response is unclear, although I believe they will readily agree to New York.

Indemnification (similar to issues with Buy Side Direct):  
Agreement assigns no liability to 3rd parties which the agreement describes 
as ""providers of software"".  As Trading Edge is the nominal counterparty for 
all trades, this may be acceptable if the agreement held Trading Edge liable 
for settling trades.  However, I do not see where section 11 addresses 
Trading Edge's liability for trades.   
We would also like assurances / liability regarding the accuracy of order and 
trade information.  

Limits of Liability:
Review language in both the Access and TIPs agreements (per Trading Edge, 
they will not agree to modify the TIPs Agreement, which is dictated by a 3rd 
party).

Assignment:  
Trading Edge's agreement does not allow Enron to assign the agreement to 
other parties.  Initially, only EnronCredit.com personnel in Houston and 
possibly London would use Trading Edge's site, so this would not be an issue 
initially.  Although we would prefer that the ability to assign be included, 
this issue could be addressed later as needed.
 
Electronic Mail (#18):
We do not want to accept email communication in the event of a lawsuit.  From 
the tone of their previous response, I believe they will agree to include 
lawsuits in the definition of extraordinary matters, for which email will not 
be employed.  

Sara, how would you suggest we proceed with the Trading Edge review ?  I will 
speak with Sheila Glover regarding the involvement of Credit and Risk Control 
in our request to utilize Trading Edge's trading platform.

Thanks.

I refer to our recent conversation relating to the progress of ISDA 
negotiations with the above counterparty.

I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA.  She informs me that SITA does 
not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations 
internally and therefore intends to appoint external counsel (I urged her to 
do this as soon as possible).  Despite this intended appointment, she assured 
me that SITA wishes to enter into the ISDA as soon as possible and is keen to 
keep negotiations to a minimum.

Either I or Michael Khajeh-Noori will keep you updated as to the progress.

For your information, I also attach a status report with respect to the 
counterparties with whom Michael and I are currently negotiating.



Let me know if you need anything else.

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and

		 Subject: OGC/AGC Approval Policy for More Than One Year Contracts

Mark:

Got your voice mail on this. I wasn't sure if you were suggesting the policy 
for trading contracts or all contracts of greater than a year.

My thoughts are as follows:

1) Policy Scope: I think we need to address whether the Policy will extend to 
trading as well as origination transactions. As you know, often there is a 
very blurry line.

2) Existing Masters: If a master is in place, confirmations will be used for 
terms of one month to greater than one year. I don't think it will be 
practical for us to approve these confirmations before signature unless there 
are material modifications done to the pre-approved confirmation template in 
the master, which would require Legal approval in the present state of 
affairs.  I assume the Policy would only apply to individually negotiated 
contracts outside a Master Agreement.

3) Order of Magnitude: We should consider having a dollar figure (determined 
simply by multiplying the notional or contract volume x the contract price or 
the Enron financial commitment amount), coupled with the one year or greater 
term, that would require the additional OGC/AGC approval in order to make 
sure the requirement is imposed only for higher dollar contracts.

I would be happy to discuss this with you further.

Alan

"Richard:

The corporate workbook reflects that the officers of Enron Credit, Inc. all 
reside in the U.K.  I don't see anyone identified with a power of attorney 
for executing documents in Houston.  

As there may be tax issues associated with U.K. officers signing (in the U.K) 
on behalf of a U.S. company, I am asking  for verification from Janine.

My suggestion is that Enron Credit Ltd. negotiate and execute the agreement 
and include the usual ""affiliates, representatives, etc."" who may need to 
know any confidential information.  Your V.P.'s are all in London.  

If Janelle confirms that it's alright for Brown, Sherriff or Seyfried to sign 
for Enron Credit, Inc. from London, then we can prepare the document and have 
a V.P. sign and fax the agreement to the U.S. party.  At a minimum, though, 
we should try to work from our form of NDA.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Tana,
I guess we need to change the Enron legal entity from Enron Corp?
In our current model the transacting entity will be Enron North America 
(which is a Delaware corporation?)
Can you then arrange a suitable signature (Haedicke?)
Can we get this done by the end of Friday?

Thanks,

Subject: New and Exciting National Fuel Deal


We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons.

The contract Mark gave me to review yesterday only covers monthly salary.  I 
had expected there to be some discussion/reference to long-term comp plan.  
Mark had mentioned that what he gave me did not deal with certain non-compete 
payments owed to me in 2000, so I am not looking for that, but I did think he 
had said that there was something in the doucment re:long-term, which I 
cannot find.  Please advise if I am missing something.  I will withhold other 
comments for now, except to note that the draft was dated 13 March, and had a 
14 day period before expiry (now passed), and will assume that that is an 
irrelevancy.  Look forward to hearing from one of you. mcs

This rate change implements a rate settlement reached in 1999, so we don't 
have grounds for protest.  I'll bookmark the issue for review when Transco 
files it's next Section 4 on March 1st.  We can argue that the backhaul rates 
should be cost based, as opposed tothe full forward haul rate that's being 
charged.

I left a message for the manager of Transco's Rates Department to call me.  
If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities 
are the same now.  In Jan, the ""true backhaul"" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was 
$.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges.  We actually did 
some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.

I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until 
October, after the summer period?

?	Legal (Sayre/Taylor)

I'll wait to hear from David/Ted tomorrow morning as to whether I should provide a complete draft to any of these other functions or to Rick Buy at this point, or if I should wait until later in the week when we've all had the opportunity to review.  

As I turn around the next draft, I'll work on a power point presentation for use in the executive meetings beginning the last week of June (Business Unit Offices of the Chairman, Whalley, Causey, Fastow, Skilling).  I made a quick summary of changes in the document attached below; going forward I will refine this and perhaps red-line the current policy to assist our detailed review.  


Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.

Subject: EB Top 10 List Winners!

First, I would like to congratulate each of you -- you were the winners of 
the Joe Sutton Top 10 List!  You have won a $25 gift certificate to the 
Signature Shop.  (Please note that as of tomorrow, you will be able to order 
eThink merchandise from the store!)

There is, however, an unexpected down side to all of this.  As you are aware, 
Joe Sutton has left Enron.  Due to his departure we are now unable to run the 
list.  Your names will be published as winners of the contest, but we won't 
be able to show the list.

Please feel free to call me at (713) 853-9843 if you have any questions.  If 
you don't get your certificate by the end of next week, please let me know.

Thanks again for your fabulous entries.

Warm regards,
Sarah.

We told Paul Hastings that we would release our Guaranty and the Opinion at

fax the guaranty and opinion (once I have it signed), with a letter from me
saying you can't release it until funding...

Good morning.

In order to finish up Delta/Salmon tomorrow, please note we need the
following today:

GE parent guaranty
LOC (so that full payment can be made to GE tomorrow)
Opinion of counsel

And once funds are received by GE, we need the receipt of funds letter.

Lee, I haven't heard back from the Portland gang to find out if the LV Co
Gen contract is ready.  Maybe Jake can help shake that loose.

Date: 3/9/01
To: Jan Smutny-Jones, Steven Kelly, Katie Kaplan
Cc: IEP Board of Directors
From: Julee Malinowski-Ball, Edson + Modisette
RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 3/9


RECENT EVENTS:

-- AB 60x (Hertzberg) is going to be amended before its hearing on Monday.
The original version would have required, as a condition of permitting a
powerplant, developers to offer to sell the power to California entities.
The new amendments do not appear to address IEP=01,s concerns with the meas=
ure
and may be even worse.  IEP is currently reviewing the following language
and is expected to maintain its opposition:

Section 25525.3 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission shall
require, as a condition of certification, that the applicant shall offer to
enter into a contract to sell to an electrical corporation as defined in
Section 218 of the Public Utilities Code, a municipal corporation as define=
d
in Section 9601 of the Public Utilities Code, or the Department of Water
Resources, electrical power generated by the facility as its initial and
continuing available capacity on terms not less favorable than the terms of
the next offer that the applicant makes for the sale of electrical power
generated by that facility.
(b) This section applies to applications filed prior to the effective date
of the act that added this section that have not been certified by the
commission prior to that date.
(c)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the commission
to delay the adoption of a final decision in any proceeding in which public
record has been closed and submitted for a final decision.
(d)  The commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the implementatio=
n
and enforcement of this section.

-- AB 8x (Migden), which would give the EOB additional and undefined powers
related to the coordination of operation and maintenance schedules, passed
the Assembly Appropriations committee.  As a follow-up to the policy
committee hearing, IEP submitted comments and amendments to the author=01,s
office.  Before any changes to the bill are made, Migden=01,s office has
indicated their preference for a larger stakeholder meeting to address thes=
e
and others concerns, which is unlikely to occur before the bill passes off
the Assembly floor next week.  IEP=01,s primary interest is getting changes=
 to
the bill that it can live with before it reaches the Senate policy
committee.

-- SB 39x (Speier), which would define generators as public utilities and
put the CPUC in the role of coordinating outages and maintenance schedules,
passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee with little change.  One
of the amendments taken would clarify that only owners of the divested
plants would be subject to the provisions in the bill.  Several generators
met with Speier this week to plead their case with little affect.  The
measure will go to the Senate floor next and is expected to pass.  Where
this measure will find difficulties is in the Assembly, which will have
already passed out AB 8x (Migden), which accomplishes the same goals as SB
39x.  Chances are that the Assembly ECA committee would hold SB 39x in
deference to the committee=01,s position on AB 8x.  The same could be said =
for
AB 8x on the Senate side, but AB 8x came from the Administration which may
give it more weight to move it forward.

-- The Senate Energy Committee heard SB 47x (Battin), which lowers the
payments of the purchase power agreements between the QFs and the IOUs, but
did not vote on the measure.  Senator Bowen, Chair of the committee, was
intent on discussing selected provisions of the bill and their relationship
to public policy objectives before she felt comfortable taking a vote.  She
indicated a desire to continue discussions with stakeholders to address and
clarify issues and concerns in the bill, and bring it up for another hearin=
g
and vote most likely next Tuesday.  IEP continues to seek support for the
measure and add co-authors.

-- The Senate Energy Committee also heard SB 28x (Sher/Battin), which makes
various changes to the siting process including many IEP-sponsored
proposals.  So far this is the most comprehensive and positive siting bill
introduced, with the greatest chance of moving forward.  The bill passed ou=
t
of the committee on a 9 to 0 vote even though most of the environmental
community testified in opposition.  Chris Ellison and I are continuing to
work with the authors=01, staff to develop additional language which should=
 be
available before the measure goes to the Assembly.  Senator Bowen, however,
has indicated she will bring it back to her committee for another hearing i=
f
there are any significant changes, slowing the bill=01,s progress.

-- AB 36x (Wright), which would apply specified repower projects to the
6-month expedited siting process established in AB 970 (2000), passed out o=
f
the Assembly Appropriations Committee.  IEP testified in support of the
bill, still noting we were still working with the author on language.  IEP
continues to believe that with the current language, few, if any, projects
would qualify and is working with staff on fixing that.

--  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both the
special session and regular session.  Please let me know if you need copies
of any of these bills.

Most companies send us their fixed-price bidweek data in this format. It's

"Lee,

The best way to go about it would be to send the invoice to Jody, but copy 
the Enron project folks you have been dealing with.  

Are we ready to sign the Fountain Valley contract?  I would think that we 
could sign the change order at the same time, and payment terms can be 
whatever the Enron project team has bought in to.  The banks won't care.

Have you seen sig pages for ESA yet?

Dan,

Enermetrix will be matching us up with the Buyers.  We would have the right 
to perform a credit check and turn around in 48 hours however we should know 
the counterparty before we submit a bid.  This would be for both gas and 
power.  Additionally, the agreement that I sent to you was already negotiated 
by EES and has concessions in it that can speed up the process.

Lets discuss.

"Ted,

We have the first running version of VaR model for the MG positions. Many 
thanks to Tanya and Anjam for taking lead
in this effort. We had also great help from Cantekin and Kirstee. We want to 
validate some  inputs
before releasing the number. Specifically, I want to make sure that both 
London and Houston work
with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion.

A few comments.

1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston 
(Cantekin)  and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs.
The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to 
multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee,
please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).

2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated 
positions and prices on a regular basis.

3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas:

 a. VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its 
portfolios. This is the liquidity risk
       resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the 
underlying positions.
 b.  We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating 
the position numbers (i.e. look
                      into the details of specific transactions).  From what 
I know, MG has a fairly rudimentary risk
       management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option 
prices (and deltas). They get some
                      option prices by calling brokers.

4. I think the current VaR is within 80-85% of the true number (assuming the 
inputs are right). But, as I have said,
     VaR does not capture all the risks that we have to worry about.

I long for the time when I can gaze into your lovely golden brown eyes and 
lose myself in your innate beauty.  The sheer black leather rockies revealing 
your strong athletic form tonight will be a wonderful memory upon which I can 
call upon to see me through any of life's most challenging obstacles.  
Sigh!!!!!!!

I plan on leaving for the magical journey tonight as soon as humanly

can take journey upon my green Camry steed to pluck the lovely young Ms.

Subject: El Paso / ENA Deal Completely Terminated Now

El Paso, Enron Terminate $38 Million Mega-Deal

     In a stunning announcement late yesterday, El Paso Natural Gas said it 
had reached a
     ""mutual agreement"" with Enron North America Corp. to terminate the $38 
million
     negotiated mega-deal for 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity that the marketer had 
entered into in
     December. The negotiated arrangement covers three separate capacity 
agreements. 

     The decision to release Enron from the three capacity agreements was 
somewhat
     puzzling, given that Enron last week had asked to be let out of only one 
contract - the
     famed Block II agreement (614 MMcf/d) - due to the restrictions that 
FERC had
     placed on the delivery rights of the capacity. In a Jan. 27 letter, 
Enron notified El Paso
     of its intent to exit the Block II contract, but the letter didn't 
indicate that it wanted to
     terminate the Blocks I and III contracts. See Daily GPI, Feb. 3) 

     ""They asked for it [to be released] and we agreed to it. It was a mutual 
agreement,""
     said El Paso spokesman Mel Scott. The capacity agreements will be 
terminated on Jan.
     31. Afterward, El Paso said it will hold open season from Feb. 7 to Feb. 
14 for the
     capacity. 

     ""It is unfortunate that the recent FERC order modified the capacity 
rights in a way that
     will not allow the capacity to serve the purpose that Enron North 
America originally
     intended when they outbid the prearranged transactions. In the interest 
of fairness and
     good customer relations, we have agreed to release them from the 
contracts,"" said John
     W. Somerhalder II, president of El Paso Energy's Pipeline Group. 

     El Paso Natural Gas has asked FERC to reconsider the mid-January order 
that
     essentially has reduced the commercial value of the Block II firm 
transportation
     capacity that Enron had agreed to acquire. With the collapse of its 
contract deal with
     Enron, it couldn't be immediately determined whether El Paso will 
continue to pursue
     rehearing. 

     El Paso is seeking rehearing after being rebuffed by FERC in its request 
to stay the
     provision in the order restricting delivery rights of Block II capacity. 

     The pipeline is seeking a reversal of a decision in which FERC said El 
Paso's 1996
     turned-back capacity settlement bars El Paso from marketing Block II 
capacity on a
     primary basis to any delivery point other than the one at Pacific Gas &
     Electric-Topock, AZ. That ruling stripped the Block II capacity of 
primary delivery
     access to the Southern California Gas-Topock delivery point, which is 
the most
     sought-after by shippers of San Juan Basin gas. 

     It was a major blow to El Paso and Enron, which had contracted for the 
Block II
     capacity in December on the condition that it would have primary 
delivery access to the
     Southern California market.. 

     Without a favorable decision on rehearing, ""the result may well be a 
diminution of the
     value of Block II capacity,"" El Paso told FERC. ""Without question, 
Enron, as a new
     shipper on the capacity"" and future holders of that capacity ""will 
suffer a disadvantage in
     the market...."" 

     El Paso contends the Commission's ruling, if unchanged, would thwart the 
intent of the
     1996 settlement, which called for the pipeline and its customers to 
share the risks of
     unsubscribed capacity on El Paso's system, and for El Paso to share a 
portion of the
     revenues it received from re-marketing the capacity. 

     ""An essential element in El Paso's ability to maximize the revenues it 
agreed to share
     with its firm customers was the ability to market the 614 MMcf/d of 
Block II capacity
     on a primary basis to delivery points other than PG&E-Topock,"" the 
pipeline noted.
     Stripping El Paso of delivery-point flexibility for Block II capacity 
""will have a serious
     adverse impact on [its] ability to generate the maximum possible 
revenues for its
     capacity and thereby recover the costs it and its customers would 
otherwise have to
     absorb."" 

     El Paso further said the Commission's decision was at odds with a 1998 
order
     addressing whether the pipeline could re-market capacity turned back by 
PG&E to the
     SoCal-Topock delivery point on a primary basis. Since the 1996 
settlement was silent
     on whether El Paso could re-market the capacity to delivery points other 
than
     PG&E-Topock, the Commission reasoned the settlement didn't preclude El 
Paso from
     selling the capacity at SoCal-Topock. 

     ""That ruling established the proper interpretation of the 1996 
settlement. Now, the
     Commission has re-interpreted that same provision in a manner that is 
completely
     contrary to its previous ruling. The Commission provides no explanation 
as to how
     these two rulings can be reconciled or, alternatively, why it has 
changed its mind...."" 

     El Paso said it was also seeking rehearing because it ""cannot find any 
evidence"" in the
     mid-January order that the Commission ""even read, much less considered"" 
its response
     as to the ""proper interpretation"" of the1996 settlement.

		 Subject: Enron Guaranties for Indian Mesa II PPA & GSPA

Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the Enron guaranties to be made 
in support of EPMI's obligations under the Indian Mesa II Renewable Energy 
Purchase Agreement (""PPA"") and Green  Premium Sharing Agreement (""GSPA"").? 
The guaranty for the PPA is blacklined against the Enron EPC Contract 
guaranty in favor of the banks which was granted in connection with our 
Cabazon Wind Power Project (the project most recently financed by EWC) and 
the GPSA guaranty is blacklined against the PPA guaranty.  As we discussed 
last week, since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will 
acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants, we thought that we 
should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was 
negotiated by Enron and the banks.  We plan to use the same basic form for 
the Enron guaranty that will be made in favor of EPMI with respect to the 
seller's obligations under the PPA.  We will forward the draft of that 
guaranty to you later today.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have 
any questions concerning the attached guaranties.  Thank you.

Should I contact Tim Hamilton, or have you already done this?  Also--if you could help me find where in the websites the information is, that would be helpful.  Is it just the OFO tariffs that are on the websites or is there actual data on how often they have called OFOs, when they were called, etc. also published?  We need all of that to better evaluate our risks/costs of serving those customers.  Thanks for your help.

Greetings Colleen:
I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.

Jeff

Leslie -- Funny you should ask.  Columbia of Ohio called 51 OFO/OMO days last winter.  Other Columbia companies ( C of Penn., C of VA) did likewise.  Attached is a confidential draft complaint from our attorney in Ohio that I believe provides the info you seek.  Also attached is the Complaint filed by Hess,et al in Pennsylvania against Columbia there.  The facts and allegations are essentially the same:  confiscation/interruption of banked gas during OFO; OFO called for economic, not operational  reasons; heavy penalties for failure to deliver full MDQ; etc. 
My recollection is that Peoples and NorthShore called few, if any OFOs last winter.  Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it.
Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance.

Last week I asked you about OFOs and you requested a list of the LDCs we are most interested in.  At this time (and in this order), I need any information you can give us on OFO history (frequency, actual dates, reason for OFO--system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs:

	PG&E, Socal	
	NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore
	Columbia of Ohio

This is a good starting point for now.  Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.

"Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Subject: Workload Responsibiities in Argentina

Andrea and Fabian;

Over the past few days, Randy Young, Mike Guerriero and I discussed the 
proper manner to have the both of you working as an integrated legal team in 
Argentina.  According to Mike, the below listed activities are being pursued 
in Argentina:

Wholesale Origination
Retail Origination
EES
EnronOnline
Power Trading
Gas Trading
Weather Derivatives
Energy Finance
Networks

Although I would be comfortable to leave the workload division up to you, I 
would like to suggest the following (bearing in mind that there is never a 
clear understanding about ""where you draw the line""):

Andrea:  Wholesale and Retail Origination; EnronOnLine; Power and Gas 
Trading; Weather Derivatives; Energy Finance.
Fabian: Wholesale and Retail Origination; EES; Energy Finance.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that there is not a 
significant difference between Wholesale and Retail Origination deals in 
Argentina.  In view of this, I would suggest the two of you assist all 
Origination deals (regardless of being a Wholesale or a Retail deal).  Also, 
both of you should be involved in Energy Finance as I believe such deals 
would arise from Wholesale and Retail Origination transactions.  In short, 
both of you would do legal support to ""Origination"", however, Andrea would 
focus on Trading and Fabian would concentrate in EES type of deals.

In addition, Fabian would manage Luiz Watanabe's workload in Argentina, but I 
would leave this to Luiz to structure and implement.

Kindly let me know if my thoughts make sense to you and please return to me 
with your comments asap.

I have not made any reference to ""Networks"" as I have no idea what it relates 
to ...  Is this related to Enron Communication ?

As a final note, please be advised that our baby should arrive on Thursday, 
July 23.  As of such date, I will be available by e-mail and cel phone only.

Rgds,

Sami

Subject: CES Daily March Requirements for 4/3 and 4/4


The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   4/3
(Intraday)     and 4/4  .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with
today's date contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes in this spreadsheet are not
current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Hi Sara:

I heard about a group called ""Looking at Art"", and they are going to
Marfa, Texas to check out the art colony there. I remembered that you
had gone there a couple of times and enjoyed it. The most important
thing about the conversation to me was that it reminded me that I had
not heard from you in a while. I am sure that you are very busy, but I
wanted you to know that I hoped things are going well with you and that
you get a chance to kick back some soon. Probably because that is what I
want to do.

Take Care,

"I have created a new subdirectory in the attorney forms bank and moved the 
approved swap forms there.  The subdirectory is called ""Swaps"" and there are 
two sub-subdirectories under there called ""Current Forms"" and ""Old Forms"".  I 
hope this makes it easier to find the swap forms.

Also, by popular acclaim, we are doing away with the old numerical naming 
system for forms like 2101a, 2101b, and giving them  names like 
isda-multicurrency, isda-local currency, industrial-u.s. (was 2103.doc), 
industrial-canadian, etc..  I hope this also makes it easier to find forms.

I am also moving forms we frequently use  located mainly in my directory, but 
also in other people's directories, into the atty.fms bank.  If there is a 
form you would like me to move in that I haven't, please let me know.  This 
should make the forms available to users outside the Houston office.

"I've chartered in the BVI a number of times and it is a great place to take 
beginners.  I only caught your post of yesterday so didn't see the earlier 
thread.  I'm assuming you're picking up the boat in Road Town or nearby.  The 
only problem with getting away from the dock by 12 or so is if the boat isn't 
quite ready.  I've always used the Moorings so they're the only outfit I 
know.  They don't usually let you get started on the boat until after the 
chart briefing which means you don't go aboard until 10.  If you use their 
provisioning service it eases that chore but sometimes the food isn't there 
right on time.  Having several people (but not too many) around this time is 
helpful to put food away, take inventory, attend boat briefing, etc.  Of 
course, if you get the boat the day before - maybe with a sleepaboard option 
or some such, you have that much more certainty that everything will be done 
on time.  Check with your charter company about attending the briefings 
before sending the last person off to the airport - some companies may 
require 2 people from your boat to attend.

As for first day - if you are away by 1 I suggest heading over to the Bight 
on Norman Island.  There are lots of moorings there and you'll get one as 
long as you're not in too late.  It shouldn't take more than a few hours to 
get there and if it looks like it might be close you can always fire up the 
engine.  There are a couple of places (a beach bar and a boat) to eat and 
drink there if you don't feel like cooking the first night and although you 
can't call it deserted or even secluded because of the number of boats there, 
there is at least very little ashore to bother you.  The caves are just 
around the corner and the Indians right outside for great snorkeling/diving 
either that afternoon or first thing the next day.

Whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise doesn't really matter.  My 
advice running roughly clockwise: 

skip Soppers Hole - just a commercial port with little of interest (unless 
you're clearing customs); 

skip the USVI - all the clearing out & in & out & in can take a lot of time 
and there's plenty to do in the BVI - if you just have to go, the northern 
shore of St. John is the best - nice anchorages (several of the 'secluded' 
variety) without the crime on St. Thomas and the resort at Caneel Bay will 
let you come ashore for a fancy dinner (but make reservations and leave your 
trash on board - there's nowhere to put it); 

Jost van Dyke is fun - anchor in Great Harbor or pick up a mooring in Little 
Harbor - Sydney's Peace & Love restaurant in Little Harbor still has an honor 
bar where you mix your own drinks & just keep track in his little black book 
while you're waiting for dinner, Foxie's in Great Harbor is a classic beach 
bar/rest. - lots of fun and good food & drinks;  

Sandy Cay is everyone's image of a desert island and perfect for a lunch stop 
and a swim; 

don't miss Cane Garden Bay (unless the northerly swell is too heavy) there's 
a wonderful swath of pure white beach with palm trees swaying overhead and 
steel drum bands serenade you into the evening - watch the reefs but the 
channel in is well marked; 

if there's a full moon be sure to be on Tortola somewhere that night (Cane 
Garden works fine) to get to Bomba's Shack for the party - there are lots of 
taxis there as the evening progresses to get you back; 

it's easy to pick people up (or drop them off) at the airport (close to the 
water with a dinghy dock) midweek if you need to and kind of fun to be met 
that way; 

the Baths are a must but VERY crowded (no anchoring allowed - must use a 
mooring) so I'd try to get there as early in the day as possible (Cooper 
Island, Marina Cay and area by Last Resort are nearby for the night before) - 
maybe get up early, motor or sail over and have breakfast once you're safely 
moored - and be careful to use the right color mooring and avoid the ones 
reserved for commercial craft;  

I usually skip Spanish Town (Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor) since I'd rather be 
at anchor than stuck in a marina slip with no breeze, but if you stay there 
you can get a taxi to the Baths and top off with water in case your crew is 
not serious enough about fresh water conservation (and what crew ever is?); 

the Bitter End is great for a long hot shower (I think you pay at the resort 
front desk) and maybe a 'fancy' dinner and there is also a water dock there 
(10 cents a gal.?).   

Sometimes it seems like the distances are so short you don't get to sail 
enough - you shouldn't have any trouble getting a lot in (but you won't be 
able to see everything).  The only difficulty might be if you need to get the 
boat back in for an early flight but I've let people out at Cane Garden Bay 
to take a taxi to the early flight & then sailed around to have the boat back 
well before noon.  Having said that, I suggest Cooper Island or the Bight for 
your last night - it just makes that last morning a bit more leisurely.   And 
just as I mentioned for the first night, it makes sense to get into most 
anchorages early rather than late so you're sure to get a mooring (in those 
that have them) and don't have to worry about finding a spot for the boat - 
many of them can get quite crowded.  Of course, if you're going anytime 
between now and Thanksgiving there shouldn't be any trouble with crowds - 
just pay daily, close attention to the weather forecasts!

Don't expect much in the way of night life but there are places to eat at 
nearly every anchorage - many are closed in the low season.  A few of the 
islands have some good hiking but there's not much for the sight seers 
either.  But snorkeling and diving are everywhere.  Ask at your chart 
briefing for the best spots these days.  If you have divers along, don't miss 
the wreck of the Rhone - you can have a dive boat come and meet you there and 
bring along equipment and a guide for the divers.  The cruising guide will 
have lots of info on all these issues.

Wish I was going - it's always a blast!

"Hi Evie:
As you know Edison is being, well, Edison about just about everything at the PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing
 
The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a ""reasonable"" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.
 
At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time.
 
I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around Edison.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  Will Mike Kahl be at DJ's meeting?
 
Best,

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

Guys,
This Enpower calc issue is a joke.   How can we be the most Innovative 
Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem.  
Furthermore, how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our 
power transactions when our back office (risk books, position management, 
settlements) is so unreliable from an IT standpoint.

In addition, we will start losing all of our key people in this area because 
they are here until 8:30-9:00 every night and 4:00 pm on ""holidays"".  This 
whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt 
with accordingly.

Please advise.  Thank you.

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the 
power port calc.  The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the 
message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months 
now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday 
(Enron holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and 
should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six 
times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by 
4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a 
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders 
by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact on 
our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution 
of this problem.
Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower 
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.  
I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing 
business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the 
agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense 
or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to 
another server.
Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

Subject: athena vs quark

With regards to the message below, we must have athena (server) to run our 
nightly risk books for the power group.  We run one of our three east power 
calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solution 
for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken 
away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We 
usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5 
hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful 
completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building 
when the calc crashes at 4:30.
Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the 
last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable.
We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our 
system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense 
of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden 
today about these problems. 
I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted 
with the finger pointing between different IT groups.
Thanks.

Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language amending
the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose the
language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

I trust this will now close the open issues.

I look forward to hearing from you

Kind regards

Daniel:

Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.  If
you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option and we
can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber of
Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore, are
not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have other
business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of limitation
of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from
any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of the
office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them executed
together with the terms of business letter.

Regards.  Sara

   The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your relationship
   with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that relate
   to
   the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with the PB
   relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

   Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
   addressed
   in the documentation as drafted.

   I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as possible so
   we
   can try to get this wrapped up today.

   Kind regards

   Daniel:

   Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
   conflict
   because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with Par.8
   requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the Terms
   of
   Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts prevail.
   Are
   you agreeing with this analysis?

   Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to conflict
   with
   the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB
   (except
   for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is Enron
   Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit the
   Terms
   of Business in the same manner.

   Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or suggest a
   different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
   remaining
   documents.

   Thanks.

      Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke. Arbitration -
   more
      appropriate to general terms of business which principally
   contemplate
      the
      regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the event of
      inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause A3).

      I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

      Daniel:

      Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the ""Agreement"")
      with my colleague Angela Davis.

      I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
   relating
      to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed but
      were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

      (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par. 14 of
      the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible use of
      arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in the
   OSLA)
      so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of the
      Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to English
   courts,
      I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will
      prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

      (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same manner
   as
      Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe that you
      and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why shouldn't
      these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

      I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the
      account documentation.  Regards.

To all,

The new Enron Center Garage has opened and if those of you that have accepted 
spaces at the new garage would please return your Met and Allen Center 
parking cards ASAP,so that we can back fill your spaces with others on the 
waiting list.  The Allen Center and Met cards will be deactivated 
immediately. Please contact Parking and Transportation if you have any 
questions.  You may hand your old card to the security guard at the garage 
exit through the end of this week.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

This should explain the variance with Lubrizol.  We did not get this info.,

Subject: April 1st NG Cut Over




Lee,

On Saturday, April 1st, Lubrizol will cut over natural gas supply from Enron
to Coral at Lubrizol's Bayport plant.

In order to accomplish cut over activities, we will need a technical
representative(s) from Enron at Lubrizol's Bayport plant to participate in
the activities and to insure Enron's interests and assets are protected.

Would you please make arrangements to have an Enron technical
representative(s) report at 12:00 noon, April 1st, to the Main Guard House
at Lubrizol's Bayport plant and ask for Lubrizol's David Massigill.  David
is coordinating all the cut over operations.

If you have any questions about this, please contact me (at the numbers
indicated below) or David Massigill at (281) 479-2851, ext 2511.

Thanks and best regards.

"Enron is entitled to an additional output guarantee when we have 6 or more 
units installed in a facility.  Peter missed the point, and I didn't catch it 
because I really didn't look at FV very closely at all.   Rigby caught it.  
He disagrees with how we massaged his original language for this additional 
guarantee, and I will try to figure out his point.

Pete,

I'm sending you a fax regarding some changes requested by NEPCO/EECC
(our
affiliate).  From what he has sent me, it does not seem that the
Fountain
Valley contract contains the optional guarantee that is in effect for
plants comprised of 6 or more units.  It would seem to be applicable in
this case.  Was it deleted intentionally?

Thanks,

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Drs. Richard MacMinn and
Patrick Brockett. I am now working on my dissertation which is focused on
the weather derivatives and credit derivatives.

Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?

The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you
please offer me some energy price data during that time period?

Your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day!

"Dude:
Two things.  First, in the midst of the craziness on Friday, my black, 
Northface parka ended up getting put someplace at Sarah's that I wasn't 
privvy to, and consequently I couldn't find it.  My house keys are in it, so 
it would great to get it back.  Could you check with Bob/Sarah and see if 
it's floating around someplace over there?  Muchos gracias.

Second, could you do me a favor?  Could you pay me the full amount for Squaw 
and then collect from Cameron for what she owes you?  Sorry to be a pain in 
the ass, but I think logistically, it'll be a whole helluvalot easier to 
manage it that way (at least from my end).  And to be an even bigger 
pain.....since my schedule's a disaster with school coming to a close, could 
you stick the check in the mail?  My address is:

366 Dolores St., #3
SF, 94110

Sorry for all the hassle.

Happy birthday, man.

Best,
Jeff"

1.  How many (who?) have responded to this?  Shouldn't we have the opportunity to clear the conflict?
2.  Commit to not give advice on any similar matter without inquiring as to the party on the other side (i.e. no ""no-names"" advice on these issues).

ISSUE

For a number of business reasons, a company may enter into contracts that are 
indexed to, and sometimes settled in, its own stock. Examples of these
contracts include written put options, written call options (and warrants), 
purchased put options, purchased call options, forward sale contracts, and 
forward
purchase contracts. These contracts may be settled using a variety of 
settlement methods, or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice 
of
settlement methods. The settlement methods are:

     Physical settlement - the party designated in the contract as the buyer 
delivers the full stated amount of cash to the seller, and the seller 
delivers the full
     stated number of shares to the buyer.

     Net share settlement - the party with a loss delivers to the party with 
a gain shares with a current fair value equal to the gain.

     Net cash settlement - the party with a loss delivers to the party with a 
gain a cash payment equal to the gain, and no shares are exchanged.

The contracts described above may be either freestanding or embedded in 
another financial instrument. A freestanding contract is entered into 
separate and
apart from any of the company's other financial instruments or equity 
transactions, or it is entered into in conjunction with some other 
transaction and is legally
detachable and separately exercisable.

This Issue applies only to freestanding derivative financial instruments (for 
example, forward contracts, options, and warrants). This Issue does not apply 
to
security price guarantees or other financial instruments indexed to, or 
otherwise based on, the price of the issuer's stock that are issued in 
connection with a
purchase business combination [Note See STATUS section.], nor does it address 
the accounting for either the derivative component or the financial instrument
when the derivative component is embedded in and not detachable from the 
financial instrument. This Issue does not address the accounting for 
contracts that
are issued to compensation employees or to acquire goods or services from 
nonemployees.

The issue is how freestanding contracts that are indexed to, and potentially 
settled in, a company's own stock should be classified and measured.

EITF DISCUSSION

A. Framework for Accounting

The Task Force discussed the accounting for freestanding contracts that are 
indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock and reached 
several
consensuses, as described below. The consensuses in this Issue are to be 
applied to all freestanding derivative financial instruments that are indexed 
to, and
potentially settled in, a company's own stock; however, nonpublic companies 
may continue to apply the consensus in Issue No. 88-9, ""Put Warrants ,"" to the
instruments covered by that Issue. Hereinafter, the framework for accounting 
that is established in this Issue is referred to as the ""Model.""

(1) Initial balance sheet classification

The initial balance sheet classification generally is based on the concept 
that contracts that require net cash settlement are assets or liabilities and 
contracts that
require settlement in shares are equity instruments. If the contract provides 
the company with a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares, the 
Model
assumes settlement in shares; if the contract provides the counterparty with 
a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares, the Model assumes 
net cash
settlement. However, this Model is not applicable when settlement 
alternatives do not have the same economic value attached to them or when one 
of the
settlement alternatives is fixed or contains caps or floors. In those 
situations, the accounting for the instrument (or combination of instruments) 
should be based
on the economic substance of the transaction.1

          1 For example, if a freestanding contract, issued together with 
another instrument, requires that the issuer provide to the holder a fixed or
          guaranteed return such that the instruments are, insubstance, debt, 
the issuer should account for both instruments as liabilities, regardless of 
the
          settlement terms of the freestanding contract.

Accordingly, unless the economic substance indicates otherwise, contracts 
would be initially classified as equity, or as assets or liabilities, in the 
following
situations:

Equity instruments

     Contracts that require physical settlement or net share settlement

     Contracts that give the company a choice of net cash settlement or 
settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net share settlement).

Assets or liabilities

     Contracts that require net cash settlement

     Contracts that give the counterparty a choice of net cash settlement or 
settlement in shares (physical settlement or net share settlement).

(2) Initial measurement, and subsequent balance sheet classification and 
measurement

The Model requires that all instruments be initially measured at fair value 
and subsequently accounted for based on the initial classification and the 
assumed or
required settlement method in (1) above.2 Contracts that are initially 
classified as equity are accounted for in permanent equity. If physical 
settlement was
assumed or required and the company is obligated to deliver cash as part of 
the physical settlement,3 then public companies should refer to ASR 268, which
provides guidance by analogy for those transactions, and account for the 
transactions as provided below under ""Equity instruments - temporary equity.""

          2 For contracts that are classified as equity instruments that 
provide the company with a choice between either net share settlement or 
physical
          settlement that may require that the company deliver cash, net 
share settlement should be assumed. For contracts that are classified as 
equity
          instruments that provide the counterparty with a choice of either 
net share settlement or physical settlement that may require that the company
          deliver cash, physical settlement should be assumed.

          3 For example, if the company sells put options indexed to its own 
stock that enable the holder to sell shares back to the company at the strike
          price.

Equity instruments - permanent equity

     Contracts that require that the company deliver shares as part of a 
physical settlement or a net share settlement should be initially measured at 
fair value
     and reported in permanent equity. Subsequent changes in fair value 
should not be recognized.

     Contracts that give the company a choice of (a) net cash settlement or 
settlement in shares (including net share settlement, or physical settlement 
that
     requires that the company deliver shares) or (b) either net share 
settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash 
should be
     initially measured at fair value and reported in permanent equity. 
Subsequent changes in fair value should not be recognized. If such contracts 
are
     ultimately settled in a manner that requires that the company deliver 
cash, the amount of cash paid or received should be reported as a reduction 
of, or
     an addition to, contributed capital.

Equity instruments - temporary equity4

          4 Classification and measurement in temporary equity is required 
for public companies. ASR 268 provides guidance by analogy for transactions
          classified as temporary equity.

     Contracts that (a) require that the company deliver cash as part of a 
physical settlement, (b) give the company a choice of either net cash 
settlement or
     physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash, or (c) 
give the counterparty a choice of either net share settlement or physical 
settlement
     that requires that the company deliver cash should be initially measured 
at fair value and reported in permanent equity, and an amount equal to the 
cash
     redemption amount under the physical settlement should be transferred to 
temporary equity.

Assets or liabilities

     Contracts that are initially classified as assets or liabilities should 
be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
and disclosed
     in the financial statements. If contracts initially classified as assets 
or liabilities are ultimately settled in shares, any gains or losses on those 
contracts
     should continue to be included in earnings.

B. Hedging

The SEC Observer stated that the SEC staff has consistently held the position 
that hedge accounting is not permitted for transactions involving the 
contracts
within the scope of this Issue because those transactions have not met all 
the criteria of Statement 80. The SEC staff also believes that hedge 
accounting for
transactions involving those contracts is inconsistent with paragraph 28 of 
Opinion 9.

Because of the SEC staff's position, the Task Force decided to end its 
discussion of whether the contracts described above can qualify for hedge 
accounting.

C. Application of the Model to Specific Instruments

The following reflects several Task Force consensuses with respect to the 
application of the Model, described in Section A of this Issue, to certain 
freestanding
derivative financial instruments that are indexed to, and potentially settled 
in, a company's own stock.

(1) Written put options5 and forward purchase contracts

          5 Includes shareholder rights (SHARP rights) issued by the company 
to shareholders that give the shareholders the right to put a specified number
          of common shares to the company for cash.

Description

The company (the buyer) agrees to buy from the seller shares at a specified 
price at some future date. The contract may be settled by physical 
settlement, net
share settlement, or net cash settlement, or the issuing company or the 
counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods.6

          6 Application of the Model to purchased call options is discussed 
in C(3).

Consensus

The Model would be applied as follows:
                                                One Settlement Method

                                                                 Physical (a)

capital.

(d) If the contracts are ultimately settled in shares, any gains or losses on 
those contracts should continue to be included in earnings.


(3) Purchased call options

Description

The company (the buyer) purchases call options that provide it with the 
right, but not the obligation, to buy from the seller, shares of the 
company's stock at a
specified price. If the options are exercised, the contract may be settled by 
physical settlement, net share settlement, or net cash settlement, or the 
issuing
company or the counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods.

Consensus

The company should follow the table included in (2) above in accounting for 
the call options.

(4) Detachable stock purchase warrants

Description

An enterprise issues senior subordinated notes with a detachable warrant that 
gives the holder both the right to purchase 6,250 shares of the enterprise's 
stock
for $75 per share and the right (that is, a put) to require that the 
enterprise repurchase all or any portion of the warrant for at least $2,010 
per share at a date
several months after the maturity of the notes in about 7 years.

Consensus

The proceeds should be allocated between the debt liability and the warrant 
and the resulting discount should be amortized in accordance with Opinion 21.
The warrants should be considered, in substance, debt and accounted for as a 
liability because the settlement alternatives for the warrants do not have the
same economic value attached to them and they provide the holder with a 
guaranteed return in cash that is significantly in excess of the value of the 
share
settlement alternative on the issuance date.

(5) Put warrants

Description

Put warrants are instruments with characteristics of both warrants and put 
options. The holder of the instrument is entitled to exercise (a) the warrant 
feature to
acquire the common stock of the issuer at a specified price, (b) the put 
option feature to put the instrument back to the issuer for a cash payment, 
or in some
cases, (c) both the warrant feature to acquire the common stock and the put 
option feature to put that stock back to the issuer for a cash payment. Put
warrants are frequently issued concurrently with debt securities of the 
issuer, are detachable from the debt, and may be exercisable only under 
specified
conditions. The put feature of the instrument may expire under varying 
circumstances, for example, with the passage of time or if the issuer has a 
public stock
offering. Under Opinion 14, a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of 
debt with detachable warrants must be allocated to those warrants.

Consensus

Because the contract gives the counterparty the choice of cash settlement or 
settlement in shares, public companies should report the proceeds from the
issuance of put warrants as liabilities and subsequently measure the put 
warrants at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. 
Nonpublic
companies may continue to classify and measure the put warrants in accordance 
with the consensus in Issue 88-9.

D. Earnings per Share

The Task Force reached the following consensus on how written put options 
affect the earnings-per-share calculation:

If the written put options are ""in the money"" during the period being 
reported on, the potential dilutive effect on earnings per share should be 
computed using
the reverse treasury stock method. Under that method, the incremental number 
of shares is computed as (a) the number of shares that would need to be issued
for cash at the then current market price to obtain cash to satisfy the put 
obligation less (b) the number of shares received from satisfying the puts.

The Task Force discussed whether it should comprehensively address issues 
relating to earnings per share in this Issue. The Task Force agreed that the 
FASB
should address the issues relating to earnings per share as part of its 
project on earnings per share. [Note: See STATUS section.]

STATUS

In February 1997, the FASB issued Statement 128, which supersedes Opinion 15. 
Statement 128 is effective for financial statements for both interim and
annual periods ending after December 15, 1997, and earlier application is not 
permitted.

Statement 128 affirms the consensus reached by the Task Force on how written 
put options affect the earnings per share calculation. That is, in computing
diluted EPS, Statement 128 requires use of the reverse treasury stock method 
to account for the dilutive effect of written put options and similar 
contracts that
are ""in the money"" during the reporting period. Statement 128 states that 
purchased options should not be reflected in the computation of diluted EPS 
because
to do so would be antidilutive. At the July 23 and November 18-19, 1998 
meetings, an FASB staff representative made an announcement (Topic No. D-72,
""Effects of Contracts That May Be Settled in Stock or Cash on the Computation 
of Diluted Earnings per Share "") that for those contracts that provide the
company with a choice of settlement methods, the company shall assume that 
the contract will be settled in shares. That presumption may be overcome if 
past
experience or a stated policy provides a reasonable basis to believe that it 
is probable that the contract will be paid partially or wholly in cash. For 
contracts in
which the counterparty controls the means of settlement, past experience or a 
stated policy is not determinative. Accordingly, in those situations, the more
dilutive of cash or share settlement should be used.

At the July 23-24, 1997 meeting, the Task Force addressed the accounting for 
contingent consideration issued to effect a purchase business combination in
Issue No. 97-8. ""Accounting for Contingent Consideration Issued in a Purchase 
Business Combination ."" The Task force observed that Issue 96-13 should
be applied to freestanding contracts that are indexed to, and potentially 
settled in, a company's own stock if those instruments meet the criteria in 
Issue 97-8
for recording as part of the cost of the business acquired in a purchase 
business combination.

A related issue has been discussed in Issue No. 98-12, ""The Application of 
Issue No. 96-13 to Forward Equity Sales Transactions ."" That Issue deals with
the accounting and earnings per share treatment of situations in which a 
freestanding derivative instrument (a forward contract) that is indexed to, 
and
potentially settled in, a company's own stock is issued concurrent with the 
issuance of shares of the company's stock. This Issue is limited to 
situations in which
the party to whom the common stock was sold is also the counterparty to the 
forward contract.

Another related issue has been discussed in Issue No. 99-1, ""Accounting for 
Debt Convertible into the Stock of a Consolidated Subsidiary ."" That Issue
deals with the accounting in the consolidated financial statements for debt 
issued by a consolidated subsidiary or a parent company that is convertible 
into the
stock of a consolidated subsidiary. As part of the discussion of Issue 99-1, 
Task Force members agreed to consider further whether to clarify this Issue by
indicating that equity shares of any entity under the control of the 
consolidated entity are considered ""a company's own stock.""

A related issue was discussed at the May 19-20, 1999 meeting in Issue No. 
99-3, ""Application of Issue No. 96-13 to Derivative Instruments with Multiple
Settlement Alternatives ."" That Issue deals with how certain derivative 
contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock that 
contain
multiple settlement alternatives should be accounted for.

The Task Force discussed another related issue in Issue No. 99-7, ""Accounting 
for an Accelerated Share Repurchase Program ."" That Issue addressed the
accounting for, and pooling-of-interests implications of, purchasing treasury 
stock and simultaneously entering into a forward contract indexed to the
company's own shares.

At the March 16, 2000 meeting, the Task Force discussed a related issue in 
Issue No. 00-6, ""Accounting for Freestanding Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, the Stock of a Consolidated 
Subsidiary ."" That Issue addresses how freestanding derivative instruments 
entered into
by a parent company that are indexed to, and potentially settled in, the 
stock of a consolidated subsidiary should be classified and measured in the
consolidated financial statements.

Another related issue was discussed at the March 16, 2000 meeting in Issue 
No. 00-7, ""Application of Issue No. 96-13 to Equity Derivative Instruments 
That
Contain Certain Provisions That Require Net Cash Settlement If Certain Events 
outside the Control of the Issuer Occur ."" That Issue deals with how certain
derivative contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own 
stock that require a cash payment by the issuer upon the occurrence of future
events outside the control of the issuer should be accounted for.

No further EITF discussion is planned."

23rd.  That'll work out perfectly!  I'll have you packed up and hopefully 
somewhere to put everything.  I've ordered boxes and packing bubbles for your

Jim Grace came in yesterday, but I didn't say anything to him.  Dan, of

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

Elizabeth:

I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY.  While I think we 
should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I 
nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary 
focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for 
a few days.  I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some 
comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.  Also, I'll 
have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I 
thought I could generally review the PPA in any event.

In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to 
work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one 
might look like on paper.  (See  attached).  At this point, however, I'm not 
sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in 
writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be 
adjusted on a calendar year basis.  You will note that the draft letter 
focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract 
Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than 
the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D.  
As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position.

Preliminary Overall Assessment

The PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue.  
While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year 
basis--which generally supports MPLP's position--the effect of adjusting the 
stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: 
namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for ""Year 1"" only would 
apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on 
Exhibit D) for ""Year 35"" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract 
Term.  The anomaly ""running in the other direction"" is that, under CMS's 
interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis 
(e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would 
be applied ""mid-stream"" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged ""contract year"" 
).  My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly 
(described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year 
concept (i.e., the 21 month ""Year 35"" issue) since that is a fairly easy 
concept to get your arms around..

More Information/Diligence/Research

Before a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want 
to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional 
information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally 
obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you 
forwarded):

--The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment) 
in a published Order.  Was there anything in that Order or the submissions 
(or exhibits thereto, including financial projections) that might provide 
some guidance?

--My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of 
pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance 
where the COD was not a Jan.1.  Do we (or local counsel) know whether this 
may be a ""global"" attack by CMS on these types of PPAs?

--While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question, 
confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the ""excess"" 
capacity payments from its customers--so that it presumably would have to 
issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims.

--CMS ""self bills"" itself under the PPA.  Has the statute of limitations run 
on any of its claims for refunds for prior years?  Can CMS's prior course of 
dealing be used to support MPLP's contractual interpretation, or is there 
otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior 
""overpayments"" (as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity 
payments)?  (This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the 
dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis 
only).

--The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted 
in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC.  Isn't 
this determination to be made over the life of the PPA, rather than for any 
particular period?  Assuming CMS's statement is correct, I assume it does not 
affect the validity of the PPA, but only whether CMS can recover the ""excess"" 
amount in rates?

--Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the 
PUC?  If so, can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall 
restructuring of the PPA?


Certain Points in Support of MPLP's Position

--The definition of ""Contract Capacity Factor"" provides for a calendar year 
determination and, most importantly, provides for a partial year calculation 
for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar 
year.  If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the 
COD date, it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation.

--Sec. 10(a) provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity 
Factor is less than 60%, then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D 
""shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows.... The capacity 
charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined....  
(Emphasis added).  This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and 
makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year, not on the next 
anniversary of the COD.  It arguably would not appear to make any sense to 
apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis, but 
determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments 
thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not 
require an adjustment.

 --NOTE:  The counter-argument, however, is that the foregoing language only 
pertains to the computation of a percentage ""haircut"" or adjustment that is 
applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D, whatever those may be, 
rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective.  That 
is, making this adjustment on a calendar year basis, even though the 
scheduled capacity rates change each October 1, is not necessarily in 
conflict with the rest of the PPA.

--Sec. 2(b) (Effective Date and Term) provides that the Agreement runs for 35 
years ""and thereafter from year to year,"" unless a party gives at least one 
year's notice to terminate which termination shall be effective ""at the end 
of the 35 years or any calendar year thereafter."" (Emphasis added).  Thus, 
for example, if one month after the end of the 35 year term--i.e., October 
31, 2030--a party gave notice to terminate, such termination would be 
effective December 31, 2031, not September 30, 2031 or September 30, 2032 
(i.e., not on the anniversary dates of the COD).  Thus, the PPA contemplates 
in certain respects certain ""stub"" years and certain ""long"" years, a 
contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLP's position on the stub 
and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity 
charges on Exhibit D.

--There are other calendar year based obligations--for e.g., Sec. 13 (and 
Exhibit B) reflect termination payments that, again, are calculated on a 
calendar year basis.  (We should discuss with the commercial people the 
economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be 
additional support in that respect).  (Note that some other calendar year 
based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA, but can 
still be used to reflect the underlying ""calendar year"" flavor of the PPA 
since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment).

A Few Additional Points to Note

--The PPA is devoid of default language, LDs, etc.; however, MPLP could bring 
a claim against CMS to arbitration (Sec. 18) for what it believes it is owed 
when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in 2001 (plus interest as 
provided at Sec. 20) and keep performing under the PPA.

--Although I do not see a significant issue here, let's briefly discuss the 
potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an ""indication"" of a regulatory 
disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10(c) as a way to attempt to force its 
""contract year"" interpretation of Exhibit D.  While Sec. 10(c) is one of 
those ""old school"" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec. 
10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of 
the PUC to support its contract claim.  (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an 
analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification 
to attempt to break a PPA with a QF).

"SDG&E filed a Complaint with the FERC that requests an ""emergency order 
capping at $250 per MWh the prices"" for all parties selling into the Calif 
ISO and the Calif PX.   SDG&E claims that the Calif ISO and the Calif PX are 
""fundamentally flawed and inherently incapable of producing workable 
competition"".

EPMI is directly impacted by this Complaint.   Even though FERC has approved 
EPMI's Market-Based Rate certificate after a finding that we had no market 
power, this Complaint would restrict us from selling at above $250 per MWh 
into the Calif ISO and Calif PX.

Government Affairs is responding in two ways --

1. A direct response from EPMI to FERC responding that there has been no 
finding that EPMI has market power and therefore we should not lose our 
market-based rate authority.

2. A response through WPTF (Western Power Trading Forum) and EPSA to argue 
more broadly the facts of what is going on in California (bad hedging by 
SDG&E) and poor market structure rules.

The fundamental problem is that the FERC is running scared about price spikes 
and may, without any real thinking, approve such a Complaint.  SDG&E has 
asked for expedited treatment and a decision could be out as early as mid 
August.

This issue again highlights how important the on-going FERC Investigation in 
Market Issues is for Enron.  We are putting together a detailed plan of how 
Enron will present our recommendations to FERC in this Investigation and will 
discuss this with you.

Call with questions.

Kay,

Attached is the final draft of the Two-Train Contract for the Pastoria
Project.  The parties have agreed in a side letter to complete the contract
for the third train (which should be nearly identical) by July 31, 2000.

The execution copies of the Two-Train Contract were signed by GE and
returned to me today and should be on their way to West LB tomorrow for
execution.

There were two changes to the Two-Train Contract that were hand marked by GE
on the execution copies and are not reflected in the attached electronic
copy.  Both are minor.  The first is that in the Notice provision (Article
XXV) the name, telephone number and and fax number for the GE contact person
is crossed out with an indication that the person will be named at the Order
Definition Meeting.  The second is that the Xonon Technoloy was excepted out
of Section 30.12(f), which is the provision stating that the equipment sold
by GE under the contract is of the same type, model etc. sold to other GE
customers and has no demonstrated trends of failure.

Please call me with any additional questions.

I do believe if I got just one more vote for the Chairman's Award this year, 
I just might double my tally of last year (one vote).  With such an increase 
in my voter approval rating I just make have a landslide victory this year!

The White House may become an option...

		 Subject: New Draft of Contract and Equity Forward Restructuring


     Dear Sara, Clint and Jeff:

     David Kelly reviewed the contract I sent you last night and asked me
     to make the following additional changes:

     1)  In Registration Provisions, change in two places ""this equity
     derivatives transaction"" to read ""this Transaction.""

     2)  Move dividend adjustment language to the ""Amendment of the Equity
     Definitions"" section.

     3)  On page 14, I inserted the necessary ratcheting trigger language
     that I inadvertently deleted yesterday.

     The revised document is attached.

     As Jeff and I agreed today, we are going to restructure the floating
     rate forward so that it will be a fixed rate forward.  We will
     therefore use the same confirmation for both transactions.

     We will restructure the forward as of 12/26/00 using $73.6797 as the
     base price.  This price represents the forward price as of 12/12
     ($73.5941) plus interest up to 12/26 ($0.2107) less the dividend paid
     on 12/20 ($0.1251).

     The rate we will use to calculate the interest on the forward will be
     interpolated between 3 and 4 month LIBOR set on 12/26 plus 65 basis
     points.  The forward price will be reduced by the expected dividend of
     $0.125 per share paid around 3/20/01.

     The maturity of the forward will remain April 12, 2001.

     I will be on vacation next week but Mike Collins will be able to help
     you.  He can be reached at 203-719-8385.

     Happy Holidays to you all!

     Regards,
     Christine

Margaret Carson is going to join us in the meeting next week with Nesbitt.  
Vince will check with ENA to see if they also want to attend.  I would also 
like to determine if ETS and/or NBP would want to send a representative(s), 
although Margaret said she would take copious notes for distribution to other 
key players as necessary.  We should ask Nesbitt how he would structure a 
deal for multiple clients (eg. ETS, NBP, ENA, and maybe El Paso).  

[We need to remain aware of any ""affiliate"" issues that may result, and make 
certain that we are in complete compliance with the regs.]

I will wait until after our meeting with Nesbitt before deciding if/how to 
approach El Paso.  Presumably, if asked to particpate, they would share the 
cost and have independent access to any working model that is developed.

John,

I talked to Dale Nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his 
model is to
go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his 
company.
Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase 
price of $55,000,
in case we buy the software package.

The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required 
level of support.

Dale will be in Houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit 
with us on Tuesday,
November 7, at 3:00 p.m. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.


Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

"I will be on the first panel of the FERC California conference on Thursday.  
The format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.  I need your 
help to make sure I have ""Gore-like"" command of the details.  Please help 
with the following information:
Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any 
presentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we 
have under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are 
comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever 
information you have.
Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information 
was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking 
facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.
Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from 
the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would 
be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already 
approved.
Cancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel 
comfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of 
how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.
ISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is 
there another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of 
the PX report too.
CEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: 
proposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to 
expedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less 
than 10%)?
Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the ""soft"" nature of 
the cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it 
to say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting 
requirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than 
applying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears 
the market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?
Offers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus 
any others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market 
will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility 
(and the regulators) out of the merchant function.
Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be 
courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway 
credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else ""squishing"" on the 
price cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need 
these guys on board.
Thanks."

Program


Dear General Counsels:

The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has 
advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting 
program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current 
contracts.

This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed 
with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each 
Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for 
monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.

In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small 
businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead 
costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.

We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is 
currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, 
small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone 
business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available.

Please contact me by Wednesday, April 11, 2001 and advise me of the number of 
contracts between the United States Government and the Enron entities you 
represent.  In the event any of the Enron entities which you represent have 
government contracts, we will need a member of your respective law 
department(s) to pull the government contracts, and all supporting 
documentation, from the Enron companies which you represent and be available 
to work with other members of the team.

If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-7224.

Thank you.

		 Subject: Stone and Webster/Black & Veatch/Other Development Agreements

FYI, attached are the forms of design and engineering contracts for the 
Ft.Pierce project. The Technical Design Services Agreement will be cloned - 
one for the Facility improvements and one for the King Plant improvements, 
and the Black & Veatch agreement relates to design of the transmission 
upgrades. The two Technical Design Services Agreements ( with Stone and 
Webster ) will be amended and restated to be full blown Turbo Park compliant 
EPC contracts ( covering procurement and construction, as well as design ) 
with Stone and Webster ( assuming its estimate and delivery date are 
acceptable), at the time the project goes into Turbo Park. 

The Black & Veatch agreement will not be bifurcated, as Black & Veatch will 
not be the EPC contractor, but we will expect the EPC contractor for the 
transmission improvements to warrant the work. One issue we have is how to 
get Black & Veatch to give a Turbo Park compliant transmission improvements 
design warranty, but we may be able to get the EPC contractor to warrant the 
design and the improvements ( Turbo Park did not raise this issue, but it may 
in the future, so we need to be thinking about that ). The Black & Veatch 
agreement also may be assigned to FPUA, along with the transmission upgrades 
EPC contract, as FPUA will own the transmission improvements and supervise 
their construction. 

The reason for bifurcating the agreements is to allow work on ""soft cost"" 
items to proceed now - as required to keep the project on schedule - until we 
can close the deal with FPUA/FMPA and get into Turbo Park, where the ""hard 
cost"" procurement and construction expenditures can be made without putting 
the project on balance sheet. 

I'll forward the form Turbo Park EPC Contract under separate cover. Sorry 
about the late deliveries, but maybe you will be able to pick these up in the 
am.

		 Subject: Stone and Webster/Black & Veatch/Other Development Agreements

Attached are Turbo Park and accounting ""approved"" forms of the Technical 
Design Services Agreement between FPRP and Stone & Webster ( TDSA) and the 
Agreement for Professional Engineering Services between FPRP and Black & 
Veatch ( B&V Agreement). Each form has to now be fashioned to reflect the 
business deal/payment terms/etc. Note that the Scope of Work on the TDSA 
underwent substantial modification to conform with 97-10 requirements, and 
the attached draft Scope of Work only deals with the Facility ( as defined in 
the TDSA ), and not the ""improvements"" ( which term was included in the draft 
Tasking Letter from which the Scope of Work was fashioned).I assume we will 
need to ""clone"" this TDSA except for a different Scope of Work description to 
deal with such ""improvements"" other than the Facility ( ie, I assume these 
are the King Plant improvements).

The TDSA is calculated to put as much of the Turbo Park-approved EPC in front 
of Stone & Webster at the earliest possible date, so that the amendment and 
restatement of the TDSA to make it a full blown Turbo Park EPC Contract will 
be more straightforward. Right now, it is contemplated FPRP would assign its 
interests as Construction Manager under the TDSA to ENA, and the TDSA would 
be concurrently amended and restated as set forth above, both at the time the 
FPRP goes into Phase II of Turbo Park. At the time FPRP goes into Phase I of 
Turbo Park, I believe the TDSA can remain an FPRP obligation ( like any other 
development agreement signed by a project entity that is subsequently 
transferred into Turbo Park). Since the TDSA now only involves soft cost 
expenditures, FPRP can sign it as soon as it is negotiated and agreed by 
Stone & Webster and before it goes into Phase I of Turbo Park.

The B& V Agreement, which was modeled on Black & Veatch's agreement with 
FPUA, also can be signed prior to going into Phase I as soon as it is 
negotiated with Black & Veatch. Like the TDSA, there are commercial terms 
that need to be added. It was modeled on the FPUA Black & Veatch Agreement 
because that should speed negotiation with B & V on its terms, and we may 
want to assign the B & V Agreement to FPUA ( and they too would be 
comfortable with its terms). My understanding is that FPUA is supervising the 
transmission work and will be driving the design and engineering of the 
transmission facilities, so it may make sense for FPRP to assign the B & V 
Agreement to FPUA and simply retain the obligation to pay B & V ( up to a 
cap).

I also have attached a revised version of the spreadsheet Mathew prepared 
listing FPRP contracts already entered into by FPRP ( the so-called secondary 
development agreements)  and those proposed to be entered into before we go 
into Phase I of Turbo Park. Herman and Lisa, let me know which of  the 
secondary agreements you have not previously reviewed ( those marked NO re 
your review ) that you need to review, and I will endeavor to furnish them to 
you.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Attached you will find the cash data that I have been using to derive my graphs.

In terms of the method I used to derive the average of $10 million/day, I used the net cash inflows for September and the net cash outflows for October and calculated an average based upon 41 business days.  The average came out to be $6.22 million/day and I then grossed it up a bit to be $10 million even.

Thanks,

"Last week, the WSPP drafing group met in sunny California  to continue the 
slow and steady march towards a standardized, ""national"" agreement. Schedule 
C , the service schedule for firm transactions, was the primary topic and the 
following is a summary of where the group is headed.

After much discussion, we proposed  that the group consider the definition of 
firm energy  that Tim, Christian and others have been considering.  The 
following is proposed language (the base was EPMI's version) that the WSPP 
group is currently reviewing:

Firm Power is power that is sold and scheduled in accordance with applicable 
reserve requirements for which the only excuse for the failure to deliver or 
recieve are those set forth in Schedule 3.9 of the WSPP Agreement.  Seller 
shall take steps necessary for the power to be considered Firm Power under 
this definition.

Schedule 3.9 only allows interruption if (i) within agreed recall time, (ii) 
due to an Uncontrollable Force or (iii) power is need for native load; 
provided, however it was agreed that a party would neverless be liable for 
LDs if it interrupts due to native load requirements (this last point is a 
major accomplishment that apppears to have uniform agreement and will be 
implemented in the next draft - the group claimed that the ""optics"" are 
necessary to help traditional utilities).  As a further note, the group 
agreed to do away with all references to C1 and  C2 and have just one 
Schedule.

Changes from EPMI's proposed definition where  the result of the following 
discussions:

1.  Generated vs. Sold - ""Sold"" was elected over ""generated"" because the 
group thinks that it is the receiving control area that determines the 
generator's reserve requirements.

2. ""Schedule""  was added to bolster the scheduling requirements.

3.  ""Reserves"" instead of ""Operating Reserves"" was used because the group 
thought the word operating may be too restrictive.

4.  ""WSCC reserve requirements"" was replaced with ""applicable"" reserve 
requirements because the group thinks that the WSPP Agreement is national in 
scope and should not be limited to WSPP.

5.  References to Non-firm supply as being excluded from Firm Power was 
excluded because the group thought it was redundent  - no control area would 
accept a non-firm supply as being firm.

6.  Power rather than energy is being used only bacause that is the decision 
that has already been made.

This defintion will be further discussed at  the next meeting on Aug 20th in 
Denver.  Prior to that time, I would like to get your thoughts on how this is 
shaping up and what additions/deletions are appropriate.  I look forward to 
hearing your thoughts.

Thanks.

Title: Briefing Note: Demand Overtakes Hydro in 2000
Author: Moritzburke, Zenker, Snyder
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: California Energy ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5166&m=1054 ,

Western energy markets are starting the new year with precipitation 
conditions that suggest a repeat of 1999's hydroelectric conditions: 
near-normal snowpacks in the Pacific Northwest and Canada and low snowpacks 
in California. More significantly, even if snowpacks remain high in the 
Pacific Northwest, normal demand growth coupled with normal runoff patterns 
in the second and third quarters of 2000 would

*  reinforce the likelihood that gas prices will again set the floor for 
on-peak power prices

*  keep differentials across western power markets narrow

*  support higher power prices and increase volatility as gas-fired 
generation is run more intensively to meet demand in a market with tightening 
capacity margins

From 1999 to 2000, natural gas demand will swing upward by nearly 1,200 
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day in the third quarter in response to a 
return to normal hydroelectric output and demand growth. Gas price increases 
will follow from this increased demand. Although differentials between Topock 
and the Henry Hub during the third quarter of last year averaged only $0.05 
per MMBtu above the Henry Hub price, CERA expects to see differentials this 
year averaging around $0.25 per MMBtu above Henry. This stronger western 
demand should also narrow differentials between the Henry Hub and the San 
Juan Basin, and to a lesser extent, between Henry and the Permian Basin.

Western Snowpack and Hydro Capacity: A Subregional Story
Since the beginning of winter the Pacific Northwest has received normal 
precipitation, with greater snowpacks in the northern part of that region 
than in the southern part. California currently lags behind historical 
precipitation levels at roughly 26 percent of average (see Figure 1). Given 
current conditions, it is possible that California will end winter at 
below-average hydroelectric conditions.

Western hydroelectric facilities are concentrated in Oregon, Washington, and 
British Columbia, which contain over 75 percent (roughly 46,500 megawatts 
[MW]) of the Western Systems Coordinating Council's (WSCC's) hydroelectric 
capacity, producing 80 percent (roughly 253,500 gigawatt-hours [GWh]) of the 
region's total hydroelectric generation in an average year (see Figure 2). 
Because of this high concentration of facilities, above-average precipitation 
in the Pacific Northwest can help to offset below-average precipitation in 
California and other parts of the West, although transfer capabilities limit 
the amount of energy exported from those regions.

Power Markets for 2000: Building on 1999 Dynamics
Despite hydroelectric output that was 15 percent higher than average in 1999, 
western power prices reflected the cost of gas-fired generation resources 
during nearly all periods of the year. This was a greater proportion of the 
year than in 1998 even though hydroelectric production in 1998 was only 95 
percent of 1999 levels.* CERA expects several factors to strengthen this 
dynamic in 2000, assuming normal weather conditions:

*  Western demand growth. Normal weather and economic growth will increase 
regional demand by roughly 2 percent in 2000. Growth will be strongest in the 
second and third quarters, at 6 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, adding 
9,000 GWh of demand in the second quarter, followed by 6,000 GWh in the third.

*  Return to normal hydroelectric production levels and patterns. Not only 
was 1999 hydroelectric production above normal, but 1999 Pacific Northwest 
runoff was prolonged by cool weather in the second and third quarters. Normal 
runoff dynamics in 2000 would remove roughly 6,500 MW of hydro capacity from 
the Pacific Northwest resource stack from the second to the third quarters 
(see Figure 3). By contrast, Pacific Northwest hydroelectric capacity was 
depleted by an estimated 3,000 MW from the second to the third quarters in 
1999 as a result of slower snowpack melt. This provided unseasonably high 
hydroelectric availability in the Pacific Northwest through the third and 
fourth quarters. The combination of reduced hydroelectric availability in a 
normal-weather year in 2000, a shifting of hydroelectric production back to a 
second quarter peak, and higher West-wide demand will increase the pull on 
nonhydroelectric generation resources (see Figure 4).

*  Energy exports to California. Sustained hydroelectric availability in 1999 
in the Pacific Northwest allowed exports from the region to California to 
remain strong through the third and fourth quarters, with exports at 150 and 
290 percent of normal, respectively. Exports added roughly 1,400 average 
megawatts (aMW) above average--and as much as 2,000 aMW in August--to 
California's resource base throughout the year. For 2000, CERA expects normal 
hydroelectric exports to average roughly 2,000 aMW (total of 17,500 GWh) 
during the year and 2,400 aMW (total of 5,300 GWh) in the third quarter (see 
Figure 5).

In 2000 the combination of normal load growth, normal spring and summer 
weather, and reduced hydroelectric availability will cause capacity margins 
to shrink, particularly in California (see Figure 6). The impact on power and 
gas prices will be

*  Higher average power prices. Lower average streamflows will diminish the 
output of run-of-river hydroelectric facilities during peak summer demand 
periods. As runoff dwindles into the summer, production from reservoir-fed 
facilities is available for a decreasing period of the on-peak hours. Other 
generation resources, particularly gas-fired, will be used to meet demand 
during a growing number of shoulder and off-peak hours in 2000. On-peak power 
prices will be driven higher by the increased use of gas-fired generation 
during shoulder hours. Off-peak power prices will respond to the greater 
reliance on gas-fired generation during those hours.

*  Higher average gas prices. Gas demand for power generation is expected to 
increase by 600 MMcf per day on average in 2000 and by up to 1,200 MMcf per 
day in the third quarter. This will contribute to price strength in western 
gas markets and to the higher costs of generating power.

Natural Gas Market
Although the effects of a return to normal hydro conditions become most 
evident in the third quarter as overall generation loads increase, CERA 
expects that some decline in hydroelectric output relative to last year is 
already causing a modest increase in gas demand in California. Although 
January West Coast weather has been comparable to last year, flows into 
California are up by 300 MMcf per day so far this month; storage withdrawals 
are up on a year-over-year basis as well. Based on the lower snowpack and 
lower average precipitation in California this month relative to last 
January, in-state hydroelectric generation explains approximately 400 MMcf 
per day of increased gas demand.

Normal hydroelectric generation this year will likely bring a 250 MMcf per 
day increase in western gas demand for power generation during the first 
quarter. Early indications of normal-to-above-normal snowpack and 
precipitation in the Pacific Northwest should center these increases in 
California.

This modest demand increase has helped support prices in the western markets, 
with regional weather differences contributing to western strength as well. 
Weather in both the United States as whole and the West averaged 10 percent 
warmer than normal during December, but during January temperatures in the 
West averaged only 8 percent warmer than normal while temperatures in the 
United States averaged 30 percent below normal.

Western Regional Prices
Over the next two months as seasonal heating loads within the West begin to 
tail off and hydroelectric generation increases modestly, differentials 
between western producing basins and the Henry Hub should widen. At the same 
time, as required flows into California decline, the Topock premium above 
Henry Hub prices should decline, with prices eventually falling below the Hub 
price. However, with normal weather in the West, that general weakening in 
western prices will likely take place toward the end of February and into 
March. Given the warm January, CERA expects heating load to decline by only 
400 MMcf per during February. Loads look sufficient to sustain western 
differentials near current levels.

California
As more normal winter weather takes hold in the East, prices should increase 
in that market relative to California. So far this month, strong flows into 
the state have held Topock differentials around $0.10 per MMBtu relative to 
the Henry Hub. During February flows into the state are expected to decline 
somewhat as heating demand begins to decline. Table 1 shows expected flows 
into California for winter 1999/2000 compared with winter 1998/1999. That 
weakening in the Topock differential is limited, however. Expected lower 
storage inventories in California relative to last year, as well as a low 
upside to eastern prices, should keep Topock prices from falling more than 
$0.05 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during February. Topock prices are 
expected to maintain a $0.03 per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub price (see 
Table 2).

Pacific Northwest
Although some cold weather in the Pacific Northwest has held Malin prices 
close to Topock prices during January, CERA expects the Malin price to weaken 
relative to Topock during February--and more dramatically in March. Two 
factors are expected to contribute to this weakening:

*  Hydroelectric output. Although February will bring a decline in heating 
load in both the Pacific Northwest and California regions, gas will receive 
some support from decreased hydroelectric generation relative to last year in 
California. In the Pacific Northwest gas demand is limited during spring even 
in normal hydroelectric generation conditions.

*  Canadian flows. Flows to the West Coast on Pacific Gas Transmission during 
the first quarter of 1999 dropped from an average of 2.6 Bcf per day during 
1998 to 2.4 Bcf per day as Canadian supplies headed into the Midwest on the 
Northern Border expansion. This year, given the year-over-year increase in 
Canadian supply, those flows into the Pacific Northwest should rebound to 
1998 levels.

The Topock-Malin differential so far this month has averaged only $0.06 per 
MMBtu. During the first quarter of 1999, that differential averaged $0.09 per 
MMBtu. Because of the forces described above, CERA expects a wider 
differential--$0.13 per MMBtu--this February.

Rocky Mountains
Similar forces will drive a widening in Rocky Mountain prices relative to 
prices in the south. Regional Rockies supplies are likely to increase as 
regional demand declines--although warm January weather will limit declines 
to 100 MMcf per day during February. The decline in heating load in the 
Pacific Northwest, with continued strong Canadian imports, will allow 
increased exports from the Pacific Northwest into the Rocky Mountain region 
on Northwest pipeline--similar to 1998 conditions. Within the Rockies, supply 
builds continue in the Powder River Basin; the new Fort Union and Thunder 
Creek gathering systems are now delivering a total of approximately 100 MMcf 
per day into the Rocky Mountain interstate pipeline system. Rockies 
differentials to the Henry Hub should average $0.25 per MMBtu during February.

Southwest
As demand declines and supply builds in the Rocky Mountains, CERA expects the 
spread between Rocky Mountain and San Juan Basin prices to increase slightly, 
but for February, Rockies heating load will likely keep the prices close. 
Although the differential between the two basins has averaged $0.03 this 
month and held at less than $0.05 during December, a $0.05 per MMBtu spread 
appears likely for February. This slight increase marks only the beginning of 
a wider divergence. CERA expects the differential between the two basins to 
widen to over $0.15 per MMBtu this summer as San Juan prices gain support 
from strong demand in California power markets.

"I have asked Kaye for copies of the CA's referred to.  I agree completely re: 
the need for a procedure.  Let me know what you think about the following:

1. Commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity (RE) and forwards 
the name to Credit.  At the same time, the commercial team should be 
identifying any Enron relationship with the proposed RE and discussing the 
proposal with the appropriate relationship head(s).  

2. Credit reviews the proposed RE and approves or rejects (so far there have 
been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut).  If approved, Credit 
notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to Legal 
together with the results of their investigations regarding other Enron 
relationships.

3. Legal conducts a ""screening"" Confidentiality Agreement review locally and 
forwards the name to the other Enron legal groups for similar review.   If 
the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the RE or any of its 
affiliates, the commercial team should be consulted to determine the 
appropriate level of further review.  If the commercial team considers the RE 
the subject of legitimate transactional interest, detailed review of the 
confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate.  In addition, 
if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed, Legal should analyze the 
""other Enron relationships"" to determine if they raise any legal concerns.  
Upon final approval, Legal notifies the commercial team (copying Credit).

Something this involved may make sense only for RE's that will be offered on 
the website.  Perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for RE's only 
offered pursuant to an unsolicited request.

Subject: SPA: Illinois Project Entities  

Kay:

As we discussed, I have been working with a counterparty interested in 
purchasing one or both of ENA's Illinois development project LLC's.  The 
counterparty is listed below:
  PSEG Americas Development Company, L.L.C.
  35 Waterview Blvd.
  Parsippany, NJ  94105

The key points of the proposed transaction are:

1.  The transaction would be an outright purchase of 100% of the member 
interests in one or both of the following project entities:

 Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.
 Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.

2.  The purchase price of 100% of the member interests would be:

 Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.: $3,000,000.00
 Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.: $6,000,000.00

Lisa Mellancamp was the ENA attorney who handled the CA between ENA and PSEG 
before Christmas.  At the end of November, Lisa engaged Corey Brown at 
Bracewell & Patterson to handle the preparation of a draft Securities 
Purchase Agreement in conjunction with our discussions with Coastal Power.  
Corey prepared a draft SPA based upon an option to purchase structure, but 
Coastal Power backed away from the transaction in early December.

I have received a letter from PSEG Power LLC indicating their interest in 
proceeding with a transaction in the near future.  I will forward you a copy 
of this letter for your records.  They have verbally indicated that the 
Purchase Price(s) of $3 MM and $6 MM respectively, are acceptable to them.

I believe that this is the appropriate time to bring you into the process and 
transfer things from Lisa to yourself.  Please call me to discuss the SPA 
once you have reviewed the appropriate documents.  I will be in Chicago 
tomorrow.  I can be reached by cell at (713) 412-4612 or leave me a 
voicemail.  I will be in the Houston office by noon on Friday.

Thanks,
Fred

Deal # 454471 and Deal # 418249 are both set up for contract 69357. Deal # 
418249 matches the invoice so I think Deal # 454471 needs to be killed.  

The rate and volumes on Deal # 454471 match the invoice for contract 69759 
but Deal # 460384 is set for this contract.

Bottom line - we have an extra deal (454471) in the system according to how 
we were invoiced.

If you agree, please have Elizabeth kill the deal .

"Enron Pres: Still Committed to Power Generation Business
Wednesday, September 6, 2000 12:49 PM	

	
	
	?Mail this article to a friend 
	
	By James Covert 
	Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Despite an increasing emphasis on wholesale trading 
rather than asset ownership in its electricity operations, Enron Corp. (ENE, 
news, msgs) will continue to develop and purchase power plants, president 
Jeffrey Skilling told Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday. 
	""Generation assets are essential to a successful trading operation,"" Skilling 
said, responding to recent trade reports that the company plans to exit the 
power generation business. The Houston-based energy company is ""absolutely 
not"" selling its power plants as part of its strategy, he said. 
	Enron will continue to build and purchase natural gas-fired ""peaking plants,"" 
which produce power only during times of high demand and wholesale prices, 
Skilling said. 
	Enron has begun construction of a few such projects in the U.S. Midwest and 
South, and will continue development chiefly in the U.S and Europe, he said. 
	""The margins are higher (in wholesale power markets) in Europe,"" Skilling 
said. ""The market there is more fractional, and that creates more 
opportunities for someone who's playing across the board."" 
	Developments in Europe, particularly in southern Europe, also offer a higher 
per-unit rate of return, Skilling said. 
	Nonetheless, Skilling did confirm that the company isn't interested in 
building larger-sized plants in any country, and that its construction goals 
may not be as lofty as those of other energy companies. 
	""We are not interested in building base-load plants,"" Skilling said, 
referring to large power plants that produce power in steady quantities 
around the clock. 
	""Base load simply delivers megawatts - that's a bulky, undifferentiated 
commodity,"" Skilling said. ""But peaking plants allow us to play on the shape 
of the market of that commodity."" 
	Skilling declined to give any projections or figures related to Enron's 
future development plans, saying that they weren't set in stone. 
	But Skilling said the company generally aims to site power plants where there 
are bottlenecks in the transmission system, and that Enron isn't focused on 
any one geographic region as opposed to others. 
	""There are companies out there saying they're going to build 40,000 
megwawatts by such-and-such a date, and I don't really see how that's 
possible,"" Skilling said. ""There are just too many variables to approach 
markets like that.""

Vince & Stinson,

I was given your names by Lynn Dunphy in recruiting and am taking the liberty 
of forwarding you the attached CV.  Steve Roeder is a former collegiate 
swimmer and currently coach of the master's swimming program in The Woodlands 
(my wife is president of the program).  He is also currently employed at Air 
Liquide USA (or one of its subsidiaries) over in the Galleria area.  As a 
consequence of Air Liquide's pending merger with BOC, Steve believes that 
there will be significant personnel reductions sometime during 2000 and is 
taking action now to try to locate his next professional challenge.

Lynn suggested there might be a fit with your group and I would be grateful 
if you could have a look and let me know whether you might be interested.  
Alternatively, if you don't see a fit (or are adequately staffed at the 
moment), I would be grateful for any suggestions you might have as to whom I 
might contact internally on Steve's behalf.

Many thanks in advance.

Mike- 
Thanks for taking the time to talk last evening.? I really appreciated it.? 
(By the way, how is life in the White House now that you are living with a 
President?? Is Air Force One all that it is cracked up to be?)

Please see the attached document.? By reading between the lines, hopefully 
one can see that, whereas my training has been highly technical, my desire to 
transform my career into the business side of a high-technology application 
is set in this good foundation (rather than limited by it).

Thanks again for your support.

"Please forward to others who need this information.

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small 
customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal 
that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.

Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the 
MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.  
The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not 
yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting 
attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is 
attached) are:

Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on 
the effective date of the bill)
Transmission sale at 2X book.
Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by 
customers 20KW and above.
Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the 
generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, 
investigations, etc.)
The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts 
and what the payment structure will look like.

Reaction and Timetable
Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the 
bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong 
possibility.
Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed
Republicans are strongly opposed
Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX 
labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill
We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension
We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to 
include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate 
has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access.
Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds 
to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. 
AB82XX does not address this issue.
Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a ""modified MOU.""  
Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their ""modified"" 
MOU this weekend or early next week.
The Assembly will hold an ""informational"" hearing on the bill tomorrow 
(Saturday) to get members up to speed
The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, 
with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on 
Tuesday.
The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, 
July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get 
resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working

Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional 
comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie 
Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in 
Sacramento.

If there are any questions, my pager is 888.916.7184.

Best,
Jeff

Hello Vince and Mike

I want to keep you informed.

This year all baskets will be done in a timely manner.
On last year we were going through a major move therefore 
many people played key roles in keeping us together.
This year however , is a little different , as it is always nice
to give unfortunately we can not give to everyone.
I am sending a lists of who we have so far.


There are a few names on the list that  I feel we should do something else 
for this year .
under Shirley's list of names.

(not so expensive)

They are : Move Team                                who?
                     Mail Room                                    who?   
                     Facilities Help Desk                  who?

There are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them.

Please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e-mail so far
I will need your approval for all baskets, however your input on the matter 
will be 
greatly appreciated.The list is not completed I am still waiting for 
additions.

require little, if any, preparation time).   Of course, I want Andy to
come, however he is concerned about his ability to attend, I probably
should identify another person or two to serve on the panel.

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at
least BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

adequate.

(2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

The meter number is 4371201 and is at Hastings.  This meter is gathering 
dry.  This meter was a new meter set and will probably begin flowing at the 
end of October.  It is estimated to produce about 30 dths a day.  Please

Hi Brent, I have been in contact with Dale Neuner regarding the creation of

We will need your approval on the wording that was suggested for the long 
description and other legal sign-off. I have already gone through the product 
descriptions with Andrea and no mayor comments came up. Regarding Natural Gas 
products, her comments were that we are creating a Firm product with TOP 
100%, but that is OK. Then on the additional information like delivery 
points, term, currency and unit of measure, all those alternatives have been 
given to Dale for him to load into the system.
Please give me an update on your timetable for these issues.

Subject: Aquilia

Bob:

This communication is to keep everyone informed of the back office issues 
related to EOL trades with Aquilia 

The Aquilia office (Aquilia Energy) in Omaha contacted our Settlements team 
regarding the EOL day deals(invoices) stating that they were not Aquilia 
Energy or Aquilia Risk Deals but rather Aquilia Southwest deals.  Aquilia 
Southwest is not approved for EOL trading.  To ensure timely payment, 
Settlements faxed all the invoices to the San Antonio office and have been 
notified that payment for these invoices to Aquilia Energy and Aquilia Risk 
will be made by Aquilia Southwest.  Aquilia wanted us to change the 
counterparty to Aquilia Southwest but it was explained to them that these 
were EOL deals and the counterparty would not be changed.  

Scott Mills provided a query of Jan. EOL deals to (just for Texas business) 
Settlements to help them gauge and anticipate potential counterparty issues.  

Settlements might be able to have another billing address set up for Aquilia 
Energy with the address being the San Antonio office in order to minimize the 
effort to getting the invoices to the correct office.  

I have not heard anything more regarding an assignment processes for Aquilia 
Risk/Energy and would like to know were that stands.  I would like 
clarification about Aquilia Risk having credit approval taken away for 
Physical deals.  

Thanks,
KC

"Bill -

Sorry for the delay -- I was out of town and believe it or not Enron doesn't 
have a local access number to its computer system in Monmouth, IL so I just 
got your message this morning.

Don't worry about sailing skills.  Among the rest of us we have that pretty 
well covered.  We may be a bit rusty but I'll bet we can keep the boat moving 
in the right general direction and not hit anything hard enough to do any 
serious damage.  We're going to an area that is one of the easiest places in 
the world to sail around for a few days.  Navigation is easy (you can always 
see where you're going), the waters are protected (no big waves) and the wind 
consistent and not too strong (so the boat will move but not be hard to 
handle).  The skills you mentioned (sitting, drinking & socializing) are in 
fact the critical skills for a trip like this.  We sure don't want anyone on 
board who is going to fall down on the job in any of those areas!

If you want a sneak preview, try The Moorings website -- www.moorings.com.  
Under ""Destinations"" we're going to the British Virgin Islands.  Under 
""Charter Fleet"" we'll be on a Moorings 463.

Since you have your tickets, please send me your flight arrival information.  
I need to pass that along to The Moorings so they will pick you up at the 
airport.  About the only other items left to deal with are ordering our food 
and drinks.  Amanda has abdicated any responsibility there so Linda & I will 
take care of most of that.  Any particular beverage requests?  Beer, wine, 
liquor, sodas, juices, mixers?  

And finally, just a bit if extra info:

1.  Your cell phones will not work in the BVI.  We will have a local cell 
phone on the boat but won't know the number until we get there.  If you need 
to leave a contact number with someone, give them the Moorings' number in 
Tortola (284)494-2332.  They'll try and reach us either by phone or radio if 
a call comes in.

2.  A lot of places will take credit cards but we'll need a little cash for 
renting moorings for the night (much easier than anchoring - Amanda can 
explain), meals out, departure taxes, incidentals and whatever but there 
aren't going to be lots of ATM's everywhere so you should bring what you 
think you'll need.  US Dollars are the currency.

3.  You will need your passport but there are no visa requirements.

4.  Use soft-sided luggage (easier to stow  on the boat) and try to carry 
everything on -- if they lose a checked bag it's hard to get it later.  

That's about all I can think of right now.  Feel free to ask any other 
questions.  I'm starting to get excited now too.  It's hard to believe it's 
less than 3 weeks away!

Friday is a bad day (Performance Review Committee all day).
What about 7:00 at the office or breakfast meeting at 7:00? We can meet
at Hyatt Regency Downtown (Smith Street).

Can we get together Friday morning July 7 at 800 am at your office?  That
would be particularly convenient for me.  I will have to leave downtown at
about 945 to catch a plane.  That will ensure that I wont take up too much
of your time!!  Thanks for your efforts here, and thanks for being patient

Chris;

Can you send me confirmation on the deals that were done for COH outside the
Enron-CES agreement.
The IF Index for TCO App pool is 4.53 +.0175+.02+transport.  Can you confirm
each market area delivery point with volume and delivered price.
I need a confirmation record for our files since we are buying this gas

I would like to attend the East Power sessions.  For the group in general, maybe Thursday staff meetings would work, since then everybody gets exposed to the concepts.

The East Power Fundamentals group has asked that we give a transmission primer for the analysts in their group.  Lance and I have accepted and will be presenting two talks.  I think the same material might be useful for the Research Group at large (perhaps via Thursday staff meetings or Friday brownbags) and/or a few technical corner articles.  Topics would include a glossary of terms/jargon/acronyms, basic concepts (voltage, real and reactive power, transfer limits, loop flow), structure of the network (NERC regions, major hubs, etc), and congestion issues (TLR and FTR/TCC, examples of traditional bottlenecks).  If done in a series, we could also solicit questions for explanation at a subsequent talk (if not answered on the spot).

The talks for East Power are scheduled for Aug 7 and 21 at 3pm.  We could potentially have Research members attend the East Power sessions.

Would you like to have this done for Research and what forum would you prefer?

Thanks,
Martin"

Attached are my comments to your initial draft of Appendix C to the Canadian 
form of repo agreement.  Please note the following:

(1)  You attached ""Annex II"" to the end of Appendix C.  That annex came from 
the US repo with Merrill.  The information should actually be incorporated 
into ""Appendix A"" of your repo agreement.

(2)  I am waiting to hear internally regarding substitution and a default 
issue.

(3)  Please let me know if we have any issues on the Appendix C (and add a 
reference to Appendix C at the end of your printed form).  

We should be ready to execute shortly.

Thanks.

Not at all, keep pushing for stellar.  That's what everyone wants.

Things went very well in Portland.  Belden, Kaufman, and Steffes seem very
interested and positive.  It is kind of a culture shock to see young people 
like
Belden carrying so much weight.  Its a refreshing change from most utilities 
and
govt agencies where age seems to be a prerequisite for responsibility, and
reminds me of when your former boss Gigi Coe said to me that the CPUC couldn't
hire more young people because of age discrimination issues (if that's not a
perverse result of a well-meaning policy...).

Whatever happened to Debra Stump, do you know?  She was the GSPP class of 2000

Mary Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business related e-mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:

1)  Grant the necessary access to me to be able to review the incoming e-mails directed to Mary Solmonson since March 1, 2001 through today so that I can determine which ones require a business response that I can handle.   Can these be transferred to my e:mail as a simplified way for me to complete this review?

2) Effective immediately, please create an automatic message for Mary's e-mail box that states ""I am out of the office.  All e-mails are being forwarded to Vanessa Schulte for response.""

3)  Effectively immediately, please route any new incoming e-mail messages to Vanessa Schulte's mail box. 

  Thanks in advance for your help on this matter.

Subject: Spark Spread Confirmation

Dale/Bart/Sara,

We need to clean up the confirmation and any other legal information that 
accompanies it (Bart/Sara, is the attached Omnibus T&Cs we proposed to use 
standard documentation or are any revisions necessary prior to sending out to 
CCSI?) so that we can send this out to CCSI for their review.

Looking at the confirmation, I see the following items that need to be 
revised:

Trade date/Signing date - Not yet confirmed; will insert date the deal is 
closed when it is known.
Need to specify which curve to look at in the Gas Daily Index (there is a low 
high and a mid or average); we did not specify which one we would refer to 
previously
Do we need to replace ECT with ENA throughout??
Catalytica should be Catalytica Combustion Systems (the subsidiary not the 
parent)
Need to add in details about CCSI (name/title/payment account info etc.)


Sean - I will get the info for 5 from CCSI

Dale - Could you correct number 2, advise on number 3 and review the document 
again to see if any other information is lacking that should be included?

Bart/Sara  - Could you advise about the details on the Omnibus (I have 
misplaced any copy of this)  I thought there were some credit issues that 
needed to be filled in at the bottom of this?

If anyone else could advise on other items that need to be addressed with 
either the Confirmation and/or the Omnibus agreement, now is the time!

"Attached is the list of PRC meetings that will cover operations for ENA, EIM 
and EGM.  Location, times and attendees are listed for each meeting.  There 
are five pre-review meetings that will take place starting today through 
December 5 in preparation for the Energy Operations PRC meeting that will be 
held on Friday, December 8.  I invite you to sit in on any or all of these 
meetings if you would like to do so.  

The most meaningful meeting will be on  December 8th.  In that meeting, we 
will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists 
and below.  I would anticipate that if at each pre-review meeting the 
preferred distribution is met as instructed, then this portion of the meeting 
will not take too long.  We will then review in more detail the managers, who 
will have been pre-ranked in the pre-review meetings.  We will also review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  I can also be prepared to 
review my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me, with you, 
Wes Colwell and David Oxley in attendance.  

Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally

"Chris looked these over and we agreed to just re-send the original 
confirmation letter, because the ISO may make cuts again - in fact, the 
revised confirm is no longer correct. I put a comment in the deal instructing 
no revised confirms to be sent, per Chris Foster.

Also, Chris noticed that the counterparty contact name in the letters was 
incorrect. The new contact at ARCO is Alicia Izarraraz. Her number is (562) 
499-3234. I hope this helps.

Thanks,

This is the original confirmation letter we sent out.



Unfortunately, before I found out anything about all this, I sent out a 
revised confirmation when the deal was changed and went into a pending 
status.  This is the revised confirmation letter that went out.



These are the only two that have been sent to the counterparty.  I have put a 
note into the TAGG system that should let us know not to send another revised 
confirmation.

Let me know if you need anything else.

"Kevin --

Attached is the East Power RTO Status Matrix as of 12.8.00.  I think that 
we've captured almost all issues (although we may need attributes to add or 
change as we move forward).  

Additionally, given that this is the first time we've put out the matrix, the 
regional people need to confirm the proper response to each attribute (so 
some things may change as I confirm the responses).  As the RTOs are so 
undefined in many cases, we are using our judgement as appropriate.

Hope this is helpful.   My thought is to re-fresh monthly.

Jim

Joe -

Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the ""sponsor"" of any of them.

Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I ""approve"" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a ""placeholder"" for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these ""approvals"" if the budget has been approved.

If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the ""extranet"" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.

Mark

Mark - these are the answers to your questions concerning our budgets.  Please let me know if this is OK with you.  I would be happy to discuss in person or via a phone call.  Let me know what's best for you.

Your name appearing on 2 projects for ENA?  
1)  ""EWS - Legal"" project. -  Cornelio spoke with you last night and confirmed 1 project actually belongs to Sheila Tweed.  So we will get her to approve.

2)  ""Legal Web Maint.""  - this is really 3 projects, which are:
Legal Web - Enhancements/maintenance for 2001 project converting ""ECT Legal Foreign & Domestic"", ""Jurisdiction Document Library"", and ""European Document Libarary"" Notes applications to intranet apps.  Sponsored by Mark Greenberg.
Physical and Financial Trading, Power Trading, Gas Assets and Industrial Markets Trading Agreements intranet site.  Replaces and expands 3 Master Agreements Notes applications.  Sponsored by Marc Taylor, Elizabeth Sager, Jeff Hodge, Julia Murray.  
ENA Legal Support application. Sponsored by W.L. Schuler
Can you informally approve these 3 projects?

Is this formal commitment to the projects?
No.  This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval.  You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year.  So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.

Subject:	FW: Transwestern Capacity Release - ENA/Burlington 
Importance:	High

FYI - When January 2002 invoices are run, please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)

Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.  

We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

Vince,

I just wanted to follow-up with you regarding the action items that were 
taken away from yesterday's meeting with you, Mike Roberts, Norma, and myself.

As you know Tony's official start date was March 12, 2001, and he has yet to 
receive a paycheck.  London's pay cycles are different than ours however, and 
they only get paid on the 20th of each month.  Tony did not receive a 
paycheck on March 20th because all of his new hire information has to be put 
into SAP (the payroll system) by the first of the month for the employee to 
receive a check on the 20th.  Consequently, Tony will not receive his first 
paycheck until April 20th.  If you would like for me to try and work with the 
London office however and try to get him a paycheck quicker than that, please 
let me know.

2)  Joe Carson
From what I am able to gather, Gary Hickerson did make Joe Carson an offer 
that consisted of a one-year contract.  However, Gary is out of town until 
Monday, and no one is sure of the specifics of the deal.  Would you like me 
to contace Joe to find out the specifics, or would it be more acceptable for 
me to wait until Gary returns so that I can get all of the facts.

I look forward to working with you.

Thanks,
Anne Labbe'

Sanjeev and John,

Thanks for your continuing interest for the storage model.   The storage 
model is
the extension to the swing model we sent you earlier, in the case of swing, 
you are only allowed to
withdraw or hold. 

 I will add some heading to the ""log"" files from the 
model.  These files includes

Curve.txt  which records the price trajectories of the  first 10 simulations,

Op???.txt, where ??? are the numbers represent the day,  these files record
decisions for each gas level, each price node for the given day.

All these files are C:\temp.

I did a presentation about the storage valuation, which explains the basic 
ideas.  
Take a look, I am open for more discussions.

Sandy:
Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can
respond
to some but not all of such comments at this point:

1.   With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our
counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section
(b),
I
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5
(b)(g)(ii)
is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep
below it.

3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different
from
the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has
fulfilled
all
of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to
it
(the ""Defaulting Party""), the other party cannot withhold any payment that
it
owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of
setoff
rights.

4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the
removal
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration
apply.

5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US
Dollars.

6.   Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i),
(ii).
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.

  Metropolitan Desk; Section B 
  Debate on Need for New Power Plants Ignores Conservation 
  By KIRK JOHNSON 
    
  09/26/2000 
  The New York Times 
  Page 1, Column 2 
  c. 2000 New York Times Company 

  New Yorkers heard a lot this summer about why their electricity bills were 
going up and
  why a new generation of power plants was needed, and the message centered 
on one
  word: demand.

  Millions of new air-conditioners, computers and other gadgets are humming, 
blinking and
  draining electricity from the power pool, utility executives and state 
energy officials said
  over and over again. The 40 percent jump in electricity rates that many in 
the region were
  assessed in August was only a hint of what could lie ahead, those officials 
suggested, if
  residents did not accept more power plants in their neighborhoods.

  What the public was not told was that the people framing the argument for 
building power
  plants have an abiding interest in selling more electricity. Nor was the 
public told that the
  means already existed to dampen demand and reduce the amount of new power 
needed, if
  the political will could be exerted.

  Before New York's energy markets were deregulated, beginning in 1998, the 
state required
  companies like Consolidated Edison to reduce demand in the system -- 
through energy
  efficiency measures, for example -- if that choice was cheaper than 
building a new plant.

  Under deregulation , that requirement has been lost. In an open market, 
every participant
  wants to sell more energy, and the government agencies in New York and other
  deregulated states that once compelled companies to think of alternatives 
have become
  silent or powerless.

  ''The reliability problems and price spikes in the last two years have led 
to a simplistic set
  of solutions: build more power plants,'' said Richard Cowart, director of 
the Regulatory
  Assistance Project, a nonprofit energy policy institute in Montpelier, Vt., 
that works with
  state regulators and utilities.

  On the new playing field, Mr. Cowart and other experts said, the incentives 
are all
  one-sided.

  Power generating companies have no motive to encourage people to use less 
energy or to
  use it more efficiently because the most money is to be made when demand is 
at its peak.
  And electricity delivery companies make more money by sending more 
electricity through
  their wires. ''The incentive to sell more electricity is overwhelming,'' 
Mr. Cowart said.

  Certainly, demand for electricity is rising in New York and across the 
country, and most
  experts agree that some added generating capacity is needed. And New York 
State's top
  electricity official, Maureen O. Helmer, chairwoman of the Public Service 
Commission, has
  emphasized in her recent speeches that conservation and efficiency measures 
must be
  part of the solution to rising demand.

  The problem, environmental groups and energy analysts say, is that in an 
arena in which
  government has taken a step back through deregulation , it is harder for 
regulators to
  make those opinions count.

  Given the tone of the debate in New York and the sharp jump in prices this 
summer, it
  would be easy for the public to think that the region's energy situation is 
worse than it
  actually is. Most long-term projections for the region say that demand will 
increase less in
  New York State and New York City than in the nation as a whole during the 
next 10 to 15
  years. New York, it turns out, is not an energy hog.

  The most recent official long-term projection for New York, called the 
State Energy Plan,
  issued in late 1998, said the state could get by with only a very modest 
expansion in
  generating capacity for the next 10 years, or no expansion at all if the 
levels of electricity
  that utilities are required to hold in reserve could be modified.

  The rate of growth in demand is also slowing down, not accelerating. Within 
the territory
  served by Consolidated Edison, which includes all of New York City and its 
northern
  suburbs, peak demand, the highest single moment of energy use on the 
heaviest day of the
  year, rose by 1.7 percent a year from the mid-1990's to the end of the 
decade. In the new
  century, that growth rate is expected to be 1.2 percent a year.

  ''It will be more modest,'' one senior Con Ed official said.

  The main implication of those projections, economists and energy analysts 
say, is that
  most of the increased capacity proposed for New York City may not be needed 
at all, at
  least to meet new demand. In the Con Ed service area, meeting a 1.2 percent 
growth in
  demand through new supply alone would require an increased capacity of 500 
to 750
  megawatts over the next five years. Developers and power plant builders 
have proposed a
  total increase six to eight times greater than that in the next three years 
alone.

  ''No one plant can make the argument that it's really needed,'' said Ashok 
Gupta, an energy
  economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private conservation 
group. ''Like
  malls, power plants are now being built for market share.''

  Predicting energy demand is notoriously difficult. In the early 1970's, for 
example, the
  accepted wisdom was that energy use would continue to grow at the rapid 
pace that it had
  in the 1960's. Academics and utility industry officials said the country 
might need 1,000
  nuclear plants by the turn of the century.

  But the oil shocks of the mid-1970's and early 1980's forced the 
introduction of
  energy-efficiency measures that made those forecasts worthless. Energy use 
as a
  percentage of the nation's economy, called energy intensity, began 
declining and has done
  so ever since.

  Some energy officials have said the problem of rising prices and the 
overwhelming focus on
  supply is the result of a still-new electricity market that is not yet 
functioning as intended.

  Theorists who had envisioned competition as the door to a golden age of 
consumer choice
  had predicted that companies specializing in demand reduction -- they sell 
ways to cut
  energy use through technology or better management -- would compete with 
companies
  selling supply. But that has not happened yet. Part of Con Ed's prediction 
of more modest
  growth in demand in coming years is based on the expectation that 
demand-management
  companies will emerge within the next few years, company officials said.

  But state regulatory officials also made the political decision in the late 
1990's to reduce
  spending for conservation and efficiency measures. The state, which once 
led the region in
  financing for alternatives to new supply -- an effort that included 
television commercials
  urging people to think about saving energy -- now spends about a third as 
much per capita
  as most states in the Northeast, including Connecticut and New Jersey, 
according to
  figures from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.

  Last month, a report filed with the State Public Service Commission 
recommended an
  increase in financing for the efficiency program. The report was produced 
by representatives
  of the electricity industry, working alongside consumer and environmental 
groups. But the
  state's utilities, including New York State Electric and Gas, Niagara 
Mohawk and Con Ed,
  refused to support the final report because they were unhappy with its 
conclusions.

  '' Deregulation undermined the role of utilities in promoting energy 
efficiency,'' said Edward
  A. Smeloff, the executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project, a 
research and
  advocacy group that helped write the report. As electricity companies have 
become more
  conscious of the bottom line under deregulation , Mr. Smeloff said, 
demand-reduction
  programs have become a threat to profits.

  For utilities that buy most of their power from other companies, moving 
more electricity
  through the wires has become the primary way to increase profits, Mr. 
Smeloff said. ''That's
  the business,'' he added.

  Utility officials say that much of their demand problems come down to one 
hour each year,
  that moment of peak demand when consumers are using the most electricity. 
To a great
  degree, planning revolves around the need to have adequate supply for that 
crucial moment
  so as to avoid blackouts. But experts like Mr. Smeloff say the tools 
already exist to
  dampen those peaks, and reduce prices to consumers as well, if only a 
constituency
  existed to push for the changes.

  Many business and residential energy uses are routine and could be 
postponed for a few
  hours to dampen load on peak days, a plan that efficiency experts say would 
be particularly
  easy in New York City commercial buildings where energy use is centrally 
controlled and
  monitored. In England, one electricity provider created lower rates for 
consumers who ran
  appliances like washing machines and dishwashers in off-peak hours. The 
program became
  so popular that power use in the middle of the night went up significantly 
during the
  discount-pricing window.

  Environmentalists also worry that increasing power capacity beyond the real 
demand in
  New York could create a kind of self-fueling spiral. If too many new plants 
are built, they
  say, prices will probably fall, encouraging people to use more electricity, 
while at the same
  time reducing incentives to save energy or use more efficient products.

  In New York and elsewhere in the country, much of the growth in demand is 
being driven by
  the spread of air-conditioning, especially from people buying extra units 
to cool more parts
  of their homes. Last year, Con Ed began a kind of visual history project in 
which employees
  began regularly photographing 90 apartment buildings in New York City and 
counting the
  number of window air-conditioners. In one year, the total went up by 5 
percent.

  Some energy experts say more air-conditioning could further increase the 
spurts in demand
  that could in turn lead to more power plants, which many scientists say are 
prime sources
  of the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.

  ''We have hotter summers because of greenhouse gases and more greenhouse 
gases
  because of more air-conditioning,'' said Joseph Romm, the executive 
director of the Center
  for Energy and Climate Solutions, a nonprofit consulting institute based in 
Virginia. ''It would
  certainly be ironic if people decided that the solution was more power 
plants.''

increase its
  electric power supply, it is doing less to promote the efficient use of

Vince - Hrvojesuggested that I drop you a note.  I am with an Austin Ventures portfolio company and we may have room for junior research people (1 or 2).  If there are some analysts or associates in your group who would be interested in talking to us and need a home, please feel free to have them call me or send a resume.  We would talk to anyone who can code option pricing formulas.  JAVA skills, or good Object Oriented programming experience and sufficient mathematical background for the FE work are priorities.  Our Chief Architect would like to see some Database understanding, but that is somewhat more flexible.  American options and Swing options are current issues, although any exotics experience is fine.  I would consider contract/part-time if someone would like to take a project while looking for positions with another larger company.
 
My thoughts and prayers are with you and your group.  I wish we had more immediate needs, but perhaps at the margin this can help.

Darren,

Glad to hear from you !   I heard that you moved to Japan, hope everything 
goes well for you.

The catastraphe option was listed in Chicago broad of trade, but the open 
interest was very small. 
Internally, Enron insurance group knows a few insurance companies offer such 
product. The contact
person is Jim Bouillion.

If you are interested to offer such bond/insurance in Japan,  we can look 
into the pricing and ""hedging"" (i.e. reinsurance)
issues.  I will discuss this with Vince, Stinson and Vasant. 

Best Regards,

Zimin

Subject: Japan Catastrophe Bonds

Hello Zimin. I hope all is well with you.

 As you may have heard,I moved to Enron Japan about 2 weeks ago in order to 
foster a financial trading presence here, with the intention of utlizing this 
location to better optimize the management of Gary's exisitng portoflios, as 
well as to identify and act on local trading or financial opportunities.

One peripheral, recurring idea has been for Enron to somehow establish a 
market in catastraphe bonds and/or insurance. Earthquakes are perhaps the 
greatest risk that the Japanese people fear according to various polls, a 
natural response to the significant number of earthquakes that occur in the 
area . Such a product  would have tremendous and widespread appeal and from a 
cursary review,  it does not appear that there is a developed,liquid market 
for such products.

I was wondering if you could talk to Vince briefly about his thoughts 
regarding the feasibility of such a product, in terms of hedging where a  
 natural offset is not found. Is this a product that research feels a hedge 
can be made against with a reasonable amount of statisitcal confidence? I 
realise this is vague and if you need any more information, please contact 
me.  


Sincerely,

Darren

Goldman is one of the brokers ""messed up"" in Lotus Notes.  I had given you 
the files some time ago with my comments.  I think it would make sense for us 
to sort through Goldman for all affiliated companies.  I don't see an 
agreement in Lotus Notes for ECT Inv. and Goldman Int'l.

		 Subject: Goldman Sachs International - Terms of Business Letter

Sara/Cheryl,
 ECT Investments Inc has received a faxed document from Goldman Sachs 
International  regarding terms of business for executing equity transactions 
through the London office.  This document is not intended for the purposes of 
opening up a new executing broker accouunt with Goldman Sachs International.  
ECT Investments Inc currently has an existing executing broker agreement with 
Goldman Sachs & Co which should cover trades done in Houston and London since 
we are trading under the same legal entity.  The Terms of Business Letter 
sets forths terms and conditions that would apply to transactions executed by 
ECT Investments in London which is governed under the SFA rules and 
regulations.
 I will forward a copy of the document to Cheryl.  Goldman Sachs 
International is waiting for us to review and sign.  If you have additional 
questions and concerns, I can be reached at extension 31439.


Thanks,
Theresa "

Subject: Cost plus contract for Co Op City

Gentlemen,

As Dave and John know, I'm working on a deal for ENA (and with Jude) which 
has as one aspect a cost plus EPC contract for the construction of a power 
plant.  We need to put together the T's and C's for a cost plus contract, and 
since it is possible that NEPCO might be the contractor, I wanted to use 
something that is acceptable to NEPCO.  I will then take the laboring oar in 
order to get a working draft prepared for this project.

As always, I'm on a short time frame, so your response would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Kay

"Ridota's a tough customer.  Very political type--knee-capper from the Wilson administration who was involved in the conflicts between Fessler and Knight, large customers and utilities, etc.  DA and Dereg done right (i.e., California never de-regulated) sound good.  May want to add the great job Davis did at locking a generation of Californians into $46 billion of contracts.  Maybe, on the energy issue, Riordin wants to look like a statesman, saying that if he were governor, he'd get everyone to the table to settle this thing once and for all--law suits, bad DWR contracts, ensuring customers have choices.

2. Inviting Nick to visit Enron
3. I can mention the possibility of Nick consulting for us. Given his status,

tivity for the day and average what has been reported as done.  The tanker =
market, for the most part, is very transparent. =20

1 in Norway
1 in France
1 in the U.S.
5 in London

As you can see, it is more popular in London.  This relates to the exact sa=
me concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight=
 market.

The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T=
9 route -  70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus Ch=
risti - described as caribs to USG.

The flat rate (ws100) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 2001 actual=
 voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt.  As u can see by the last posting (M=
ay 11th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ....If you=
 did a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 =
and the market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on t=
he 5.10 p/mt flat which =3D 1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo =3D 107,100 USD; vi=
ce versa if you bought at ws 190.

The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London=
 trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont).  We have a trading department here that sh=
ould have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it p=
ertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight.  In addit=
ion, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul crude m=
arket particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems.

90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the =
international owners have commercial representation in the States.

Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months ti=
me - contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any mar=
ket when broken down.  For example:

Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 =
boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are =
acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill liabil=
ity sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a ""last done""=
 philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC Mexic=
o where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days.

70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500,000 bbl ma=
rket.  Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.33 bbls p/mt hence 7.33 =
x 70,000 mt =3D 513,000 bbls.

This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (whe=
re the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into =
most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc.=
..  This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allow=
s the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider rang=
e of buyers.  When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usua=
lly 2 million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West A=
frica, North Sea, etc.. they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered o=
r off loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in.  (I apologize i=
f this is remedial for any readers)  In any event, when the USG sees a surg=
e in big ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up=
 by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to =
get tight which means rates will swing hard.  Currently it is a weak market=
 at the 70 x ws 160 level.

On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the carib=
s, or the T9 route.  For the most part the breakdown is as follows :

Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly domin=
ated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they del=
iver them cpp from the USG.  Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will proba=
bly have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, Orion, =
Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc. =20

Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) e=
tc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc..

Columbia -  same players

(We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns=
.)

Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility=
, a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed=
 to them.  Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading.  S=
ome of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such =
as contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s).  For example, Lyondell has a C.O..=
A. with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 move=
s p/mo.) for 2 years.  The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point for=
mula off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online=
.=20

Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if h=
ave an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flo=
ws.  Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it t=
o the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping=
 in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to d=
eal with on physical vessel trading.  In addition, the freight people are n=
ot going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line t=
hat trading Department Heads might have.

In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced mu=
ch more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001, A combine=
d result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rat=
es which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well a=
s limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any s=
upply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems=
 and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz =
with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast S.A=
merica.  Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off  we would once aga=
in be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far i=
n ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets.

The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this o=
ff the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Cit=
ibank.  Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was interested=
 in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but setting=
 up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership.  FIynn presen=
tly has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July.  The pricing would=
 be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a bid=
 of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done.  This is alwa=
ys the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals con=
cluded overall.
Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competito=
r of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment.  For it would b=
e in his best interest for there to be high activity, and as he is the only=
 one presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be eas=
y to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel.  If this was =
to take off to the level that Enron has taken other markets -- whereby futu=
res rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are be=
ing done off of different pricing scenarios i.e.- months average- specific =
day close's, first half/2nd half, etc -- if it became so big that sellers w=
eren't just owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global bo=
ok balancing tool, who knows what can be done.  The last time we tried to g=
et this going was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the grou=
p who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost mo=
mentum with legal.  Since London has been able to get it going under the di=
rection of Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here.  Scott =
advises me that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still=
 cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as=
 well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we=
 both follow now.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to =
pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the =

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

note that household prices fell in Sweden and Finland, markets that already

Subject: Canadian Sample forms of ISDA Agreements & Confirmations

Chris,

Per our conversation, I am attaching  a sample form of ISDA for both a 
Canadian corporate and a Canadian governmental.  With the governmental, the 
proposed form of legal opinion attached to the ISDA Schedule would have to be 
modified depending on your particular situtation (see footnotes in opinion).  
As I also mentioned, we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are 
getting from Hydro-Quebec in response to comments from counsel, and we may 
want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any 
governmental guarantor.  If you end up having a governmental guarantor, let 
me know and I'll send you down the revisions.

By copy of this email to Joe Hunter on the Confirmation Desk, I am asking him 
to email you copies of the form of Omnibus Confirmation and Annex A thereto 
for an ECC/Canadian Counterparty Deal.  I have to say that if you end up 
transacting with a governmental entity, our form of confirmation will not 
include the reps and warranties required to transact with such 
counterparties, since we never trade financial with governmentals prior to 
execution of a master.  If you go down that road we may have to come up with 
some kind of form, but the best route is to get the ISDA in place first.

Would you mind putting it down on paper so I can give it to Lay?  Just two or 
so bullets of the El Paso accusation and then some bullets on the more 
fundamental story.

Can I talk you or someone else who is close to this into a one pager on why  
a simple supply/demand explanation of California border prices trumps 
Carpenter's El Paso dun it conspiracy analysis?

I don't want Lay to be stumped by a question on this at his Wednesday IAEE

Attached is Paul Carpenter (Brattle Group) preliminary findings that 
marketers have market power at the border.

By my second email I'm sending Enron's responses to the pleadings at FERC 
which refute the notion of the need to reinstitute price controls at the 
California border.

Alternatively, a good argument to high gas prices at the CA border is the 
message in Stan's natural gas roundtable speech (i.e. high gas prices can be 
directly attributed to supply/demand factors).

cc: Nelson Neale/NA/Enron@Enron 
Subject: Corn Subsidy Govt Program Analysis

Hi Vince,

 Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go 
forward on the analysis and presentation for this program.  The consensus 
from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically 
driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close 
ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures.  Also it is 
preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending 
more credibility in the Ag community.  The names that came up were 
Mississippi State and Texas A&M.  Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi 
State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues.
 The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is 
primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron 
can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to 
cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the 
govt will want to worry about basis risk). 
 The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing 
down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination.  
Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination 
side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent 
of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.

Vasant

p.s. I am writing up Jim Bouillion's project suggestion as a potential 
project for Wharton.  Of course, we may still ask Wharton for their insights 
on the corn price protection approach.

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like ""they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?""  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the ""unnamed sources"" sort, ""industry sources"" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me ""are there any alternatives to deal with this mess.""  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the ""green only"" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To ""back fill"" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its ""undercollection,"" (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose ""green only"" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible."

Subject: HR Questions


	

Norma:
My husband and I have the following HR questions that I hope you can help us 
with.  As you may know, I have been out since July 12th on maternity 
leave/extended unpaid leave of absence.  My plan is to return to work on 
January 8th.  Here are my questions:

1. I am considering coming back to work on a part time basis.  From a 
benefits standpoint, is there any difference between a RRH employee (30-39 
hours) versus a RPT employee (20-29 hours)?  In others words, are there any 
benefits that I would lose if I worked part-time?

The difference is in the amount of Flexdollars you would receive, as stated 
below:

 Medical Coverage Semi Monthly 
    Flexdollars
RRH Employee Only  123.22
 Employee/Spouse 146.97
 Employee/Child 137.00
 Employee/family 165.25

RPT Employee Only  82.15
 Employee/Spouse 97.98
 Employee/Child 91.34
 Employee/family 110.17


2. Given the fact that I am not returning until January 8th, am I still 
eligible for any stock option grant program that the company may institute at 
year-end?  
 That is currently under discussion in developing the new Stock Option 
program.  However, they are leaning towards allowing individuals in your 
situation to be apart of the program.
Is there any additional paper-work that I need to submit to keep me 
eligible?   No.
Both my immediate boss, Mark Taylor and our general counsel, Mark Haedicke 
are aware of the fact that I am not returning back to work until January, 
2001.

3. Our bank account has been recently changed.  I pulled down the ""Direct 
Deposit Authorization"" form and I am assuming that all I need to do is to 
fill it out and send it back to you.  Is that correct?  Yes, please send to 
EB3698
What is your office location?

4. As I get closer to my return date, is there any paperwork that needs to be 
submitted to notify payroll of my return since I am currently not being paid?
 No.  Your time will be change coding from LOA without pay to Active time.

I look forward to hearing from you either by phone or e-mail.  My home phone 
number is 281-890-7122.

Cory,

Please see comments in attached file.  I changed the date to July 14th
assuming we can sign on this date.

 <<agree_6_13_00.doc>>    <<TsCs_6_28_00.doc>>      <<pricing_06_23_00.xls>>

I'm hoping you can rewrite these files incorporating these comments as well
as Shelly's comment below and Mike Neuman's comment from his 6/28 email
copied below.

Parent Guarantee-We feel the dollar amount for the parent guarantee should
be raised from $33Mill to $37mill to allow us some room in case of change
orders.  In any event, the Contract Price is approximately $35mill.

Thanks,
Jon

          Jon and I met with East Coast Power this morning to discuss
the contribution by El Paso of the GE Turbine for the Linden 7 Site.  The
assignment clause in the GE Terms and Conditions currently permits the
assignment by the buyer to an affiliate without GE's consent. The word
affiliate is not defined but we should be able to take the position, as a
49% equity owner in East Coast Power, that it is an El Paso affiliate.  I
would recommend that to clarify, we include the following clause after the
word affiliate in the Assignment Section: (including but not limited to East
Coast Power L.L.C.).  Andrew, Bob and Coralyn, pls advise if you would like
to take a different approach. I also expect that we will have a credit issue
when the Contract is assigned to ECP as GE is now, I believe, getting an El
Paso Energy Corp. Guaranty. According to Bob Licato at ECP, GE accepted an
ECP assignment without an Enron guaranty on Linden 6 due in part to the
presence of GECC as a lender/equity participant in ECP. We can discuss this
with GE when we inform them of the planned assignment to ECP.  Finally, I
would advise that when we get GE to sign a letter accepting the assignment,
we confirm that the GE warranties flow to ECP.

Redefined Business Units

ECT, ECM, EI, EES, and ECI will be regrouped into eight regions/businesses=

and five global functions.  Each region/business will be operated as an=20
independent entity but will coordinate staffing, career paths, compensation=

its specialized expertise across all regions/businesses.  Included in these=

"Steve,

I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather
negative: he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth
and technical details.

He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive
side.

Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after
18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

Hi Vince,

what did you think of David Hsu?

My thoughts.

Overall a good guy. Personable. Intelligent.

He could communicate reasonably well, but seemed to be capable of losing objectivity in favour of technical advancement.

He didn't seem comfortable with taking a man-management role (at least he didn't want to be an 'administrator')

He appeared to know a lot about risk. (In fact Jay Web called me to say he felt David was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull).

regards

Steve

from American Central Gas Companies, Inc. (""Guarantor"") for the benefit of 
Enron North America Corp. (""Enron"").  By letter addressed to you dated April 
6, 2000 (the ""Termination Letter""), Guarantor terminated its obligations 
under the Guaranty.  The purpose of this letter is to notify Enron that such 
Termination Letter is null and void such that no termination of the Guaranty 
by Guarantor has occurred.  In addition, Guarantor hereby agrees to amend the 
Guaranty by (1) changing the amount set forth in Section 1(b) from $1,000,000 
to $2,000,000 and (2) by changing the text of the fourth paragraph in Section 
6 to read as follows:  ""This Guaranty shall terminate on the date (such date 
being the ""Termination Date"") that is the earlier of (a) July __, 2000 or (b) 
the effective date of any written notice of termination sent by Guarantor as 
set forth below.   Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written 
notice of such termination to ECT and upon the effectiveness of such 
termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as 
provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination by 
Guarantor shall be effective until five (5) days after receipt by ECT of such 
termination notice.  No termination of this Guaranty pursuant to the 
provisions of this paragraph shall affect Guarantor's liability with respect 
to any Transaction (as defined in the Contracts) entered into prior to the 
Termination Date, which Transaction shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the 
terms of this Guaranty.""

Please acknowledge your acceptance of the terms of this letter, by signing in 
the space provided below.  


"
"I am faxing you both the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement executed between 
Enron Gas Marketing (merged now into ECT) and Aquila Energy Marketing 
Corporation (merged now into Utilicorp.) with respect to Utilicorp. ""signing"" 
the agreement in lieu of giving a guaranty.   Actually what Utilicorp. did in 
this agreement is sign as a co-obligor under the agreement (see Section 16.12 
of the agreement).  They signed accepting joint and several liability with 
respect to the obligations.   If we can get them to agree to the same 
language in your master agreement that would effectively be as good or better 
than getting a guaranty.   Anything less (like just sticking their ""name"" on 
the signature line) may not get us much or be worthless.

All this, of course, is subject to any differences between US and UK law or 
issues under UK law which I will leave in Edmund's capable hands.

Let me know if I can be of further service..."

By the way, I spoke to Chris Foster and Greg Wolfe about the relative merits 
of Steve Hall and Shari Stack.  Their thinking was that Steve is probably a 
better ""deep thinker"" (to use Elizabeth's words) but that he might be bored 
with the routine transaction work that Shari seems to really enjoy.  He also 
doesn't have the ISDA background which would provide tremendous benefit to 
us.  Therefore, I think Shari is a better fit for our current needs.  

Having said that, I am extremely impressed with Steve.  He has a better 
handle on this California work than anyone I've worked with yet.  He seems 
really bright and responsive.  I talked to him last week about working for 
Enron and he seemed interested.  I didn't get into any details about our 
needs, but gauged his general level of interest in the work that he is doing 
for us and his willingness to consider jobs other than his current one.  He 
basically said that he would be happy to hear about opportunities here.  I 
was talking to Richard Sanders yesterday and he also is impressed with Steve 
and said that he had considered trying to hire him.  I don't know if there is 
a position for Steve or not.  I just wanted to give you feedback on my 
discussions with him.  Let me know if you need any help or information from 
me on this matter.

Subject: Cairn Gas Purchase Bid

Bobby,

After meeting with Cairn today in Delhi, my perception is that our offer was 
received well.  They were more open and relaxed then they were on Wed. 
morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range, (once we 
talked through the price movements), and the seriousness of our gas related 
activities on the West Coast of India, in light of the IOC agreement.  I 
think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections 
were raised.  We did talk to some extent about the guarantees, but we didn't 
get too far and they're willing to accept at this point that what's 
acceptable to the LNG suppliers, should be suitable for their needs.  
However, they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of 
Enron Energy Marketing a little better and I told them I would get back to 
them on that point.

David and Ajay were up in Hazira yesterday looking at some property for their 
gas treatment facility, which apparently is across the road from pipeline 
access.  While there they went and looked at Shell's proposed LNG site after 
walking the last 1 km, inaccessible to their 4wd vehicle and not surprisingly 
found a beach.

In summary, here is what we offered on a non-binding basis:

Six year production plateau
85% TOP
$3.67/MMBtu Net, at a base of $18/bbl Brent, with point of sale at the 
tail-end of the gas processing plant
Floor & Cap of $15.50 - $27.00/bbl
Price movement:  +/- $1.00/ bbl from the $18/bbl base price (on a 3 mo. 
rolling average) equals +/- $0.145/MMBtu fixed on a quarterly basis
Guarantees:  Same protection we're providing the LNG suppliers under the 
Trust Retention Account

I appreciate everyone's help in submitting this offer.

Thanks,
Doug

"If there is a deal shaping up, it's happening by and large through the 
auspices of IEP.  We've thus far decided to maintain an arm's length 
relationship with IEP, choosing not to get too close to the generators.  If 
we want to influence any deal they cut, we'll need to assess how closely 
aligned/associated with them we want to be.  Further we distance ourselves, 
less likely we'll be cut in.  

That said, Sue and I have been participating in IEP's (interminable) 
conference calls and actively weighing in to influence what they do.  There 
was considerable discussion on the last call about developing some sort of 
""price cap"" proposal that could form the basis of a deal, but no discussion 
whatsoever regarding refunds of any kind.  There were differences of opinion 
about the benefits of doing a deal on a cap----Williams is dead set against 
it, Dynegy & Reliant seemed considerably more pliable.  

We reminded folks that there are many other things apart from caps that 
California could do to ""fix"" the problem (e.g., site plants, forward 
contracts, retail market, core/noncore split, etc.), which might obviate the 
need for caps altogether.  We also recognized the political nature of the 
situation and expressed a willingness to discuss a cap that might be 
acceptable, but pointed out our general concerns with caps.

That last meeting provided the impetus for the 28th press conference, at 
which (hopefully) a large number of stakeholders with urge the Governor and 
the PUC to get off the dime and do something concrete that can help---develop 
a rational policy for forward contracting by the IOUs and abandon the ""PUC as 
counterparty"" policy that currently exists.

Again, haven't heard a peep about any deal on refunds.  Will check around, 
though.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Report of Editorial Board Meeting with the San Diego Union-Tribune

IEP's public affairs consultant arranged an editorial board meeting for me 
while I was in town for the NARUC meeting.  Present were Don Sevrens, news 
editor/insight section; Bill Osborne, senior editor/opinion; Jim Gogek, 
editorial writer; Bernie Jones, editor, opinion pages; Craig Rose, the 
reporter who has written extensively on the topic, and a photographer.

My two primary messages were that (1) wholesale and retail competition is 
working elsewhere, particularly in Pennsylvania, and can eventually work in 
California if the rules are changed, and (2) California has a severe supply 
shortage and needs to focus on providing incentives for new generation and 
expediting the permitting process.  I was subtly trying to get across the 
message that leadership was needed to help Californians deal with the need to 
reconcile their environmental and land use goals with the need to bring their 
power supply and demand into balance.  I, of course, defended FERC's order on 
the causes of the price volatility in California this summer and their lack 
of any authority to order retroactive refunds.  I also pointed out that there 
were no findings of individual market abuse, so that refunds wouldn't be 
warranted even if there was legal authority.  I also pointed out the problems 
with price caps.

Other than Craig Rose, who disagreed with me any chance he got, the others 
asked good questions and seemed to be listening.  They made the point 
repeatedly that this matter is very political, suggesting that a political 
compromise with the generators/marketers is necessary.  One of them said he 
had heard there was a deal with the generators being negotiated and asked me 
my position.  I responded that I had no response.  Anything like that is the 
business of individual members.

They indicated that they expected to do a story for this coming Sunday's 
Insight Section.  Please give me any feedback you have.

"We have received comments from the referenced counterparty with respect to 
comments to an Annex A to a Confirmation.  Mary Cook, a new attorney in our 
Group, will be working on this."
"Steve,  We are currently negotiating an interconnect agreement for an upgrade 
of an existing interconnect off the Trawick System into TUFCO.  The 
interconnect is solely a delivery to TUFCO.  We are down to one point of 
difference in the agreement.  

Typically HPL disclaims any liability for consequential damages to the other 
party.  TUFCO is asking for an exception for any violation of gas quality 
specifications.  This would mean that if HPL delivered off spec gas to TUFCO 
which required cleanup of their pipeline system or caused damage to a 
customer of TUFCO's HPL would be liable under this Agreement.  

From a legal standpoint, we can make this exception, but I wanted to make 
sure everyone understood and agreed with the acceptance of this potential 
liability.  Assuming we are properly monitoring all our receipts there 
shouldn't be an issue. 

Please let me know what you think about this situation.  I can forward a copy 
of the interconnect agreement if you do not currently have one.   "

Brian,

What about meeting around 5:50 - 6:00 p.m. at the Angelica Movie Center
on Smith. There is an underground parking between Smith and Louisiana
and the movie theater will validate your parking ticket.

There are several bars at the center.

The movie starts at 7:00 with some boring speeches. Saturday should be more
interesting - it's a comedy day.

"I need you to run these items by Rick.  I take full responsibility for 
approving the hiring of the Hills firm (and I look forward to meeting with 
you and Carla as we discussed), but remain hopeful we can use their services 
for something other than WTO.  In the wake of Seattle, and as I have come to 
understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy 
services front, I have come to the view that our talent and money would be 
better spent on other activities.  My inclination is to do the bare minimum 
necessary to keep the machine going.  If we have specifically committed to 
certain things, then let's follow through.  If there are things we can avoid, 
let's avoid them.  Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva, Why 
not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage 
that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel.  With respect to 
the Hills firm, can we use the retained time to help with the specific 
strategies we are now working out for the regions?  These are the kinds of 
things we need to consider.

Subject: Enron and the Energy Services Issue Before The WTO

Steve: This is a brief extension of our conversation yesterday afternoon 
putting in print some of the upcoming dates and possible committments for 
your consideration and decision.

We have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general 
instructions to withdraw gradually (I'm not quite certain that is possible at 
this stage) you need to know the following.

The April meeting at the WTO in Geneva (Committee on Specific Committments) 
spent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in 
the WTO GATS (General Agreement on Trade and Services) . The USTR raised the 
issue, tabled the issue and guided the discussion. We did not send anyone to 
that session.

As planned for several months, we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is 
completing its basic distribution now. There has already been considerable 
interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the 
days ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. 
Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading 
Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He 
raised the issue of Japan's industry feeling energy services was going too 
fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in 
Seattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine, president of CSI that he was told later 
by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We'll hear more 
tonight.

Later today, the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss 
how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical 
advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. 
DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting 
held at their request.

Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update 
members (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is 
essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official 
handling energy services.

She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting 
and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in 
Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in 
the discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of 
assistance. This is a decision point for you.

We have made some other committments which are also decision points although 
the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings 
that when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you 
and Rick, you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go 
forward.  We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone 
from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the 
commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet 
Union. They are important points of contact for our commercial people.  This 
year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them 
to exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee 
will do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner.

Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the 
ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is 
organizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue 
on energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta, who 
recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite 
supportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to 
Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick's memo this week suggested we have Peter 
Styles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with 
the ESC. Therefore, unless we participate, Europe's energy industry is not 
talking with US industry. If this is what you want, then I should tell Uta 
that we are unable to do the meeting.

The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on 
June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth, Secretary General of the BIAC 
(Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world 
conference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug, an American 
and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD 
Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future.  I had 
planned to be there with Ken for the day, day and a half he will be in Paris. 
I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become 
increasingly involved in issues of interest to us.

Well, these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to 
proceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is 
likely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been 
accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services 
agenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause 
criticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I 
thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However, 
if you want to exit, other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting, I 
think the other meetings are firm committements at this point.

These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision.

Joe

Subject: Reconstruction of Clerical Area


	



 During   the  construction of the clerical area the clerks will do their 
best to continue to function in a normal manner.  The fax machines will be 
located in EB3837A  (cubicle area in front of Suzanne Adams).    There should 
be no interruptions in the fax lines per the Telephony Services.  Office 
supplies will also be boxed and stored in various areas throughout the 
floor.  There will be 2  phones  and computers available to the clerks.  
Reginald will be located at EB3808B x39288 and Tim and Kenneth will be 
located at EB3808B x31459.

 This may  cause time delays on various functions of the clerks:

Faxes being sent, received, copied and delivered in a timely manner;
ASAP deliveries/pickups/courier outgoing/incoming/scheduled and unscheduled 
daily runs to Allen Center;
Telephone accessibility will be limited;
Space preparation for large ASAP copy jobs;
Availability of clerks when needed;

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Thanks,
Kate

Subject: APEA Gas Sale: Force Majeure by Clark PUD

Dale,

Further to my phone call this morning, I have contacted John Watts at Avista 
requesting a copy of the Force Majeure letter they are sending to APEA.  I 
will forward this as soon as I receive it.  The event in this case is 
preventative maintenance.  It appears that there are stress fractures in 
certain of Clark's generation equipment.  GE is installing equipment to 
assess the problem.  The installation and removal of this equipment will 
involve an outage totaling 5 days over the next 2 weeks.  The question is:  
Is preventative maintenance a legitimate Force Majeure event under the 
APEA/Clark contract and thus under the APEA/ENGMC contract?

Thanks for your help,

Laird

"Hi Katie,  So far so good.  Busy but moving forward.  It will be interesting 
to see if I catch my flight or if I have to delay it some.  Denver should be 
nice.  I was watching the weather channel and it appears that it will be 
pretty cold up there.  I saw something about lows in the 10-20s.  Yikes!  
You're right though. I enjoy traveling every once in a while for a change of 
pace.  The guys I work with up there are fun, so that makes the work go alot 
easier.  

Take care and talk to you later.

Hey Gerald!
 I'm doing O.K.  How are you?  Mon. and Tues. were busy, but the rest of
the week shouldn't be too bad.  The research project is going well,
except that a lot of the articles we need have to be ordered because our
libraries do not carry the journals.  That's probably typical though.
Tomorrow we have a big meeting with my prof to come up with an outline
for the project, so things should really start falling into place pretty
soon. Starting next Mon. I will be volunteering for the Health-for-all
clinics Health Educator (we have to volunteer for one of my classes).  I
will be helping diabetics and people with high blood pressure plan their
diet and physical activity schedule.  I'm pretty excited, but still need
to read up on nutrition since I am a little rusty.
 Denver, huh?  It will be so beautiful.  I've only been to Colorado once
to ski.  I wasn't too big on the skiing thing, but I did enjoy the
scenery.  You will have a great time.  Do you like that you have to
travel every once in a while for your job?  I would think that it would
be nice to get out of Houston every once in a while.
 Did it rain in Houston last night?  THere was a huge thunderstorm here
around 4:30a.m.  It almost sounded like it was hailing for a minute, but
I don't think it did.  I heard Ft. Worth got it pretty badly.  Three
people were confirmed dead today.  On a lighter note, have fun on your
trip!

 I'm not so sure about the Nobel Prize thing, but hey... it would be
nice.

Take care,

		 Subject: Re: Brief in Rate Stabilization Proceeding

Jeanne - you shouldn't compromise Enron's prior statements on ending the rate 
freeze.  The most important thing is that we not get a retroactive end of the 
rate freeze (retroactive to any time before the date of the order).  We may 
also accomplish this through legislation.

Regarding the book vs. market valuation, it is less important that we argue 
for market or book than it is we should clarify for the commission how and 
why it should be consistent with the new legislation.  If new legislation 
occurs and means that utility generation will be priced at cost for 10 years, 
then everyone needs to realize that is a fundamentally different construct.  
DA Customers are not getting the value of these plants through the valuation 
process so they must have access to that value through the access to retained 
generation approach. If cost based rates are not legislated, market valuation 
shoud proceed.  What we don't want is for them to legislate cost-based rates 
and then forget about the value being stripped from DA.

Also, seems like it could be a good thing to point out that if they do 
declare an end to the rate freeze, if it is effective before new replacement 
legislation is enacted, they've only created another quagmire.   I'll call to 
discuss.

		 Subject: Brief in Rate Stabilization Proceeding

Despite the fact that the hearings will probably continue into Wednesday of
this week, the briefs in Phase I of the Rate Stabilization Proceeding are
still due this Friday the 2nd.  One of the issues before the  ALJ is the use
of interim versus final market valuation to end the rate freeze.  I am very
hesitant to say that the rate freeze cannot end on the basis of a Commission
approved interim valuation as Enron has, in previous proceedings, taken the
position that it can.  Please let me know right away if you feel different
about this.  Along these same lines, the issue of the value of the assets is
somewhat at play (at least on an interim basis).  Do we want to take a
position that the assets need to be market valued (rather than book) thus
increasing the rate base for the purpose of cost of service regulation which
the assets are now under? Increased generation rate would mean an increased
DA credit. However, it may also hurt our claim that we should get a piece of
the retained generation.  Again let me know as soon as possible about your
position.

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
	Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

Paul & Raymond,

It took more than a few days to catch up after I came back from Australia. 
There  are few things I would like to bring up to your attention.

First of all, I would like to thank you for your hospitality. I learned a lot
about the Australian markets and was greatly impressed with the
quality of the people at the Sydney office.

1. The resume you sent to me and Grant looks quite good.
I think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help
you with a phone interview.

2. I have received another resume that looks very promising. I am
very interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over
to the States  where we lack desperately technical talent.
Can you help us by interviewing him in Sydney? 
The main determination I need from you is whether he can
function in a company like Enron. As any good academic
he sent his resume in a ps format and I shall fax you a copy in case
you don't have a PostScript reader on your system.

3. Christian Werner does some really neat things on
the weather front. I would like to determine if he can help
us to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houston
for a week to discuss the weather forecasting  technology with  Mike 
Roberts and Joe Hrgovcic? I think that he could learn a lot
from Mike and other weather guys here how we translate 
weather info into business-related information. I shall be glad to
underwrite the cost of this trip.

Further to the recent queries you raised concerning the ETA, we can provide=

the electronic =01&click=018 method of submitting offers or execution.=20

This same principle provides protection to you in that the only binding=20

 which certain terms have been clicked upon by you and the same terms=20
accepted by Enron through the automated EnronOnline process.
 The system is designed to ensure that BOTH PARTIES ARE BOUND BY the terms =

Subject: Electricity price volatility


Dear Dr. Kaminski,
I'm an economist (M.Sc., Caltech, Ph.D., Iowa) who has been working for the
Alberta government for the last seven years on electricity deregulation in
Alberta, Canada. I have been looking for research papers on the measurement
and causes of price volatility in electricity markets.

As a policy maker, I am interested in the implications of government policy
decisions on price volatility. As an economist who has had a hand in
designing the electricity markets here, I am also interested in how the
design of electricity markets and the associated institutions affect price
volatility.

I've found two references to a seminar talk you have given recently at
Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon called ""Volatility of Electricity Prices -
Measurement and  Analysis of Underlying Causes."" (I've also found a
multitude of references to other work that you've done, but this seemed
closest to what I'm looking for.)

Was there a paper associated with your talk that I could get a copy of? Any
help you can give me on finding information on this topic would be greatly
appreciated.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Sid Carlson

Series A Stock Purchase Agreement, The Investors' Rights Agreement, Amended

Will Enron grant a waiver for the firm to represent Clean Air Partners as

I also received a message form an AA person asking for rate/FX templates.  I know we are supposed to come up with a set of approved templates but we don't yet have a process in place.  I thought we had until next year sometime.  My guess is that the most current source is the work you did a couple of years ago on confirms.  

Scary, hunh?

I'm getting calls from different people with AA requesting copies of all ""legally approved"" confirmation templates.  I've had requests today from two different people with respect to power and rate/FX.  Do we have a formal process for  approving templates?  Where are the templates kept and how does legal know if they have been changed?   Have similar requests been made for other products?  There does not seem to be any sort of AA uniform deadline for submitting the templates.

I've asked AA to advise you so that we can all be consistent in our responses.

		 Subject: FW: Joint ACR Regarding DWR's Revenue Requirement And July 27, 20 
01 Workshop


Attached is an Assigned Commissioner's Ruling issued yesterday by
Commissioners Lynch and Brown soliciting comments on the Revenue Requirement
submitted by DWR on July 23rd.

The revenue requirement is increased from the $9.2 billion submitted in May
to $13.072 billion, but covers a longer period of time (the period of
January 17, 2001 through December 31, 2002).  The revenue requirement is
expected to pay for 118,930 GWh of power.  The revenue requirement is
divided among the three UDCs as follows (1) PG&E = $5.2 billion; (2) SCE =
$5.8 billion; and (3) SDG&E = $2.1 billion. The revenue requirement was
divided among the three UDCs based on a uniform cost per MWh of net short
energy purchased by DWR.  The bond proceeds will be applied in a manner to
supplement the revenue from the customers to DWR such that the net revenue
requirement falls within the retail rate adjustments adopted by the CPUC for
PG&E and SCE (i.e., the three cents), and assumes a comparable rate
adjustment for SDG&E

The ACR asks for comments on the revenue requirement submitted by DWR,
particularly in the areas of (a) the relationship between the UDCs retained
generation revenue requirement and the DWR revenue requirement ; and (b)
DWR's request for the establishment of ""specific charges payable to DWR for
the power sold by DWR to retail end use customers"" (e.g., should this be in
a form of separate rate element or in the form of a gross revenue amount to
be derived from rates).

The ACR also requests more information from DWR.  Specifically it requests
information on (a) the revenue DWR has already received from the UDCs; (2)
how the revenue requirement for ancillary services was calculated; (c) more
specifics on Operating Costs; and (4) a numerical illustration of the
derivation of the 1.65 cents per kWh as representing the average portion of
the 3 cent rate increase that DWR needs to generate its $13 billion revenue
requirement (a figure that was apparently reported in the press).  DWR is
suppose to serve this information on the Commission and parties to the
proceeding by Thursday the 26th.

There will be a technical workshop held on Friday the 27th to address DWR's
revenue requirement.

It is the Commission's intent after the receipt and review of comments to
issue a PD and to vote on the revenue requirement at its August 23rd
meeting.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you would like to submit comments
on the revenue requirement or have me attend the workshop.

Anyway, hope you got all your songs downloaded last night and got a good

"Lee,

You should be receiving a package shortly containing the following:

1. Changed pages for CA Energy Development I and CA Energy Development II 
facility agreements.  These are the same pages that were faxed to you and 
Kent a few days ago.  I also included a couple of original pages (73, 74, I 
think) which were missing from one of the originals.  This need to be 
initialled and executed.
2. Acknowledgement letters for each of CAED I and CAED II which need your 
Here's the form:

3. Assignment and assumption agreement to move the equipment from TurboPark 
to the CAED I.  There will be one for CAED II as well.  This document is 
being reviewed by the bank, so I'm not convinced it is in final form.  You 
will note that there is an acknowledgement section for GE.  I cut and pasted 
from the consent to assignment from the TurboPark documents, but shortened 
the whole thing considerably.  Here's that document:



4.  Signature pages (signed by Enron) from the ESA deal, both the facility 
agreement and the override letter.  Obviously, we need your signature.  


I will forward the final CA facility agreements to you once again, along with 
the blacklines against what you initialled.

Thanks,

"This is just about my intelluctual speed.



  Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue

  Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, 
  Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. 
  You move like the bass which excite me in May. 
  You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. 
  Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. 
  Ye're as fragrant as ""snuff"" right out of the can. 
  You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; 
  I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. 
  On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, 
  well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. 
  Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, 
  What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. 
  Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, 
  To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. 
  Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead.

		 Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

I don't know if you have looked too closely at the MS price sheet that I sent over the other day, but we calculate, based on Enron's curves, that they are earning upwards of USD .50/bbl.  Clearly the effects of little competition.

Definition of Event of Default - References Section 17.  I believe this 
should be Section 14.  This same reference to 17 is also made in other areas 
of the contract, such as in Section 15 ""Termination"".  Also, please note that 
under Section 15, some of the Event of Default Sections numbers do not exist 
(ie. 11 and 12).  Please look into these sections in their entirety.  With 
respect to this section, I would like to change the cure period from 30 days 
to 3 days and of course in instances of bankruptcy, misrepresenation in the 
Reps & Warr, etc., there should not a cure period.  

With respect to credit.  In reading the contract it seems that the 
counterparty is going to be a consortium of entities (MDEA, Yazoo & 
Clarksdale).  Are each of the counterparties jointly and severally liable?  
Answers to the this relationship structure will be necessary prior to 
proposing credit terms for both the Master Gas and Master Power agmts.  If 
this is the structure, we should probably look into getting legal opinions 
regarding the cities' authority to enter into such obligations.  In addition, 
do the city's have authority to enter into agreements for greater than 1 yr.  
In my experience with other munis, they generally are, but only at the 
Enterprise Fund level (Public Utility).  Perhaps we should confirm this.  To 
the extent that MDEA (stand alone) is not 100% supported by the cities, we 
will need financial statements on MDEA.

We agreed to this petition to terminate the audit once the year 2000 was
complete so that we could use that for our negative PX Credit claim proof.
Following Jan 19th of 2001 this schedule is dead anyway. Needing the audit
results of 1999 and 1998 was useless. We will be lucky to gain our money
from 2000 there is absolutely no hope of getting anything from those years
if there was an error. In addition our own analysis didn't show any areas we
were worried about in those years after our 2 run in and subsequent UDC
corrections in 98 and 99. The initial UDC position was to simply stop paying
for the audits just as they did with the PX Credits with virtually no
discussion with the CPUC.

et al. - Joint  
                                               Petition of SCE, PG&E, and
SDG&E             
 





Attached for your information is a joint petition for modification of the
1998 Revenue Adjustment Proceeding (""RAP"") decision filed today by SCE,
PG&E
and SDG&E.  The utilities request that, on an expedited basis, the
Commission limit the scope of the PX Credit audit which WPTF obtained in a
negotiated settlement in the 1998 RAP proceeding to remaining year 2000
calculations and thereafter order that the audit be terminated.  They state
that the audit is both irrelevant and costly and that ""common sense
demands""
the Commission reconsider the decision.

They ask that comments in opposition be filed by August 3, reply comments
on
August 10 and a Commission decision at its meeting scheduled for August 23.
They also ask the Commission to waive the period provided in Rule 77.7 for
comments and reply comments on a draft decision in order that the decision
become final immediately.

The filing states that there have been dramatic changes in energy markets,
the number of DA customers has declined significantly and that ratepayers
should not have to pay for the audit.  Of course, they don't mention that
the reason for the decline in DA customers is their own failure to pay the
PX Credit.  It is instead attributed to the ""dysfunctional restructuring
scheme and concommitant rise in wholesale energy prices.""  They justify
their request legally by stating that their filing demonstrates that there
are ""significant new facts"" and a ""material change in conditions.""  The
third criteria for reopening or modifying a Commission decision, a basic
misconception of law or fact by the Commission, is not alleged to have
occurred.

They also state that DA penetration will continue to decline because
""Assembly Bills X1-1 and X1-6 have effectively reregulated the market.""

Attached to the filing are declarations from the three ESP members of the
Audit Committee, Bob Anderson of APSES,  Aaron Thomas of AES NewEnergy and
Marilynn Semro of Seattle City Light Department, in support of the
utilities' petition.  I have not reviewed the specific wording changes to
the RAP decision to determine if there are any problems with the proposed
modifications.

I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory

entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?

physically or financially.  Thanks,  John

 Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Mark,

I finally got to speak with Mike yesterday. The short answer is that Nora 
Dobin in Global Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other 
than the swap. Mark Taylor (or his designee) will handle the swap.

We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of V&E to assist us on 
the Whitewing issues. In case you didn't know, Ron and Trena represented us 
in the creation of Whitewing (and its holding company Condor) and have been 
involved in all the subsequent Condor/Whitewing transactions. Because Jeff 
Eldredge has a significant role in Margaux, I hope having V&E involved here 
and in London will facilitate coordination on these issues.

Cheers

Subject: Margaux/Whitewing


Ron/Trina/Ben,

I wanted to touch base with you on some Margaux-related issues for Whitewing 
and determine what the appropriate course of action is.  

As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been 
updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the 
synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.  The method by 
which this occurs is as follows.  Whitewing continues to hold the equity 
interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of 
Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which 
are held by Enron).  Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with 
ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount 
representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making 
a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment 
from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things 
happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of 
the projects through the floating leg).  Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) 
raises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, 
purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM.  In 
other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its 
receiveable to Margaux.  The net result is that Whitewing receives cash 
proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a 
floating payment obligation to Margaux.  I've attached a structure diagram 
below.

With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen.  
The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from 
Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from 
Donette Dewar below).  My question is how do we achieve this result.  First, 
is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need 
to occur at a subsidiary level?  In other words, does the swap fall under the 
definition of ""Indebtedness"" (clause (viii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP 
Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?  If it cannot, is SE 
Acquisition the best candidate to be ENA's counterparty, or do we run into 
issues with the Natwest facility (although they'd likely consent since they 
will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?  Once the issue of 
who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss 
the mechanics by which we effect the transaction.  If we are indeed going to 
open up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to 
revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy 
task.  If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need 
to determine where.  Also, I'm sure this transaction will require 
Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.  A 
final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be 
responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level.

More generally, are there any other legal or other issues that you see with 
respect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective?

If you'd like to discuss the transaction further, please let me know.  I'll 
be in Houston the early part of next week, so perhaps we can spend some time 
discussing these issues then.  Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you next 
week.

Best regards,

Stuart

Subject: Margaux - Whitewing Partnership amendment

As you may recall, the tax comments to the debt term sheet reflected a need 
for an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement to admit ENA as a 
partner. You also may recall that we briefly discussed the potential for 
legal/accounting/other issues that may arise as a result of any such 
amendment.  So that the Whitewing process can be moved forward, would you 
please consider the following:

1. Have any legal/accounting/other issues been identified as resulting from 
an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement?

2. If so, what are the potential solutions to any such issues?

3. Have definite conclusions been reached regarding the economics of ENA's 
preferred return on the Whitewing interest, such that a draft of the 
necessary partnership allocations can be undertaken?

4. Has a decision been made regarding who will be charged with drafting the 
amendments?  Will it be the Margaux legal team?  The Houston Global Finance 
legal group?  Other??

Thanks, in advance, for your consideration of these issues.

Kindest Regards,

DMD

I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

"No, the ETA says that if you have a master agreement in place it governs 
trades in the relevant commodities.  In fact, we used that language to 
mollify the people who were afraid we were going to stop sending confirms 
when they first signed up for EnronOnline.  To the extent we want to 
eliminate confirms for counterparties with masters, we will need their 
agreement.  

From a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms 
for GTC-governed  transactions without asking the customer first.  Whether or 
not that is a good idea from a customer relations/marketing/PR view I will 
leave to others.  Since some customers seem to want this pretty badly, you 
might consider offering to do away with the paper for customers who sign up 
for your new data transfer arrangement before making it generally 
available......

Leslie Reeves and I met today with Mark Taylor and Mark Haedicke to discuss 
the eliminination of confirmations for transacations executed on 
EnronOnline.  Mark Taylor has been supportive of the elimination of 
confirmations, and in the meeting today Mark Haedicke agreed.  This 
elimination of confirmations will have to be reviewed on a counterparty by 
counterparty basis, and for each counterparty, commodity by commodity.  

Next steps:  Document EOL process and records that can evidence the execution 
of a transaction (ease of availability, type of   record available, retention 
schedule for records, etc. (Sheri Thomas?)

        Create a priortized list of counterparties to be approached for 
elimination of confirmations - large number of    transactions, those that 
have asked for paper-relief, etc. (Leslie Reeves/Kim Theriot)

         Set up meeting with Andy Zipper, Jay Webb, Tom Gros, Mark Taylor, 
Jeff Hodge (Legal-Physical Gas), Elizabeth   Saeger (Legal-Power), and Leslie

Vince,
 
I talked to Sean, and asked him to prepare Zhiyong for our meeting with him.
Zhiyong and Sean had an agreement that Zhiyong would support Sean when the
time comes for Sean to transfer to Research.  
 
Unfortunitely Zhiyong can not make it for Friday's meeting because I just heard he
had a car accident and may stay in hospital for a week (flower?).  Sean will visit Zhiyong
in the hospital and will bring up this issue. I think as long as we allow Sean to have
enough time for his transition (help Zhiyong out), Zhiyong would agree. If Zhiyong did
not make any noise, things should be just fine.

PS: Thanks for the support you have been giving me. I think that Paulo and I will work out
things to maximize the Research value.

I think the reason that they haven't moved has been one of timing.  Chris has 
not had time to pull them out of their spreadsheets and put them onto 
another.  This, of course, has led to the obvious point that we are still not 
comfortable using the service P&L from unify.  When Scott gets back next

take care of it manually until system resources can handle it.

Is there some reason why we are not allocating demand charges for the market 
area pipes to the Market East p&l?  If the only reason is that you're not 
sure which ones to do, this is my suggestion.  It seems to me that there are 
only three pipelines where there is overlap and that would be Tennessee, 
Texas Eastern and Transco.  For now, why don't we leave all the demand 
charges for those three pipes, plus all others not listed below, with the 
East p&l, and move the following pipe demand charges to the Market East 
book:  Algonquin, Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Natural Resources, CNG, 
Cove Point, Equitrans, Gatherco, Iroquois, Marco, National Fuel.

Obviously you need to confirm this with Dick and Scott, but this seems to 
make sense to me.  Please advise.

       (others who received earlier message)
From: Don Schultz
Re: Joint Defense Meeting - progress notes.

We received several votes in favor of Charles Tetrault's suggestion to
meet the week after the Feb. 22 hearing, rather than on Feb. 23-24, and
that makes sense to us as well.  Tom Nicholas advises that the Wright
group would like the meeting to be held February 27-28 in Houston,
rather than Denver.   Jay Barrymore would prefer the meeting be held
March 5-6 in Denver.  Clay Latimer is available February 27-28 and would
prefer the meeting be held in Denver.  I was unable to reach Clay this
afternoon to determine if March 5-6 would work for him.  We have
confirmed availability among hotels in downtown Denver to host for
either date window.  Some of the Wright folks are reportedly checking on
availability of Houston hotels for February 27-28.  The Kansas Steering
Committee is meeting by phone tomorrow morning, and we will need to come
to a final decision in the next day or two on which to base meeting
plans.  Wright lead defense counsel are concentrated in Houston, and so
it might make sense for the Wright group to meet independently and in a
different location; however, there are a number of counsel who will need
to attend both meetings, so the meetings probably should not be at the
same time in different cities.  Thus far, we have not announced plans to
any of the JDT groups at large.

thank you notes are going out today.  

The company meetings did not go quite as well as I might have hoped (Edon was 
not so interested), but we need to discuss further the potential relationship 
with Credit Lyonnais' effort to develop the ""gap financing"" fund.UNEP 
conference not as billed but some contacts there such as Credit Suisse First 
Boston and Gerling's Sustainable Development Company were useful as both are 
quite interested in climate change business opportunities.  Also it provided 
a chance to gather interesting updated info on current financial-sustainable 
development metrics, links, funds, firms, etc.  Discussions with participants 
in the UK Emissions Trading group were interesting and I now have several 
working papers on this effort which I can distribute to anyone who is 
interested (though Mark's group probably has them already but I'll check with 
them directly on that). I did not get the chance to meet up with Nicola Steen.

"Ken:  In connection with our new product (and  absence of any physical 
activity in that product), I have the following question:

If neither ENA nor its counterparty is able to qualify as an offeree for 
purposes of the Trade Option Exemption (17 CFR Sec. 32.13, as amended) but 
each is an eligible swap participant (or better yet, each party has $10 
million in net worth as per Sec. 32.13) can the option still be exempt from 
CFTC regulation under the Swap Policy Statement or any CFTC interpretive 
letters?

I have concerns about not relying fully on the Trade Option Exemption but I 
also understood that the CFTC has informally said that the Swap Policy 
Statement provides a safe harbor for both swaps and options.

I am available to speak at your convenience.  Thanks.  Sara [713/853-5620] "

I can send you what I have on the WestLB stuff, but it may not help too much 
if you are trying to figure out how to get turbines into a project.  We are 
currently working on the mechanics relating to that.

It may take a while to get a copy, as I don't have an electronic version and

Hi Kay.  Thanks for this input.  My somewhat knee-jerk reaction has been that 
NEPCo is, indeed, taking a very aggressive approach.  We are also hearing 
that they are under some sort of ""mandate"" to include these provisions in 
their contracts on a going forward basis (I think I might have some idea of 
what that's about), but we are obviously concerned that it won't fly with a 
third party buyer of our project.  Dean, Jim Fowler (our outside counsel at 
McCutchen) and I may want to chat about it with you further.

On a related note, I keep running into the need to have a more basic 
understanding of the West LB documents and the GE LM-6000 contract than I 
have.  Do you have copies of those documents, and could I ask you to have 
copies made and sent to me?  Much appreciated.

Hope all is well,
Karen

Subject: Re: EPC Limits of Liability  

NEPCO's position sounds more typical for a cost plus contract.  Is this a 
lump sum deal? If so, then I think NEPCO is taking an aggressive approach to 
both LOL and retention.  A 10% limit of liability during the warranty period 
is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit 
of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense. Another 
factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the GE 
contract.  Is NEPCO taking risk on GE performance, and is the dollar value of 
the GE equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability?

I'm glad to discuss this if I can be of help.

Kay

Subject: EPC Limits of Liability

Kay - Ron Coker in the CTG group suggested you might be able to help with 
this.

ENA/SF is in the middle of negotiating the EPC contract for Pastoria (750 MW) 
with NEPCO.  We have hit a couple of snags in the contract and would very 
much appreciate your input as to what is ""market."" 

1. Limit of Liability -  NEPCO would like 80% up to Substantial Completion, 
40% up to Final Acceptance, and 10% for the Warranty Period.  GE's LOL is 
100% of their contract value though the warranty period. (which Kiewit also 
agreed to on Pittsburg.)
2. Retention - NEPCO would like to have 10% retention on payments only for 
the first 5% on the contract value and then 5% retention thereafter.  We 
would prefer 10% throughout the payment schedule.

What do you think?  We want the Owner's position to be as strong as possible 
to enhance the sale of the project, but NEPCO is under a great amount of 
pressure to reduce their contingent liability, and we really don't want to 
leave them holding the bag once we are gone if it is not necessary.  

Regards, Dean

thanks for the response.

I agree with you that identifying all of the Regulatory Risks associated wi=

calculate the potential loss and assign people to mitigate these risks. =20

On the flip side of the risk coin, the process of identifying Regulatory Ri=

=20
identify rule changes / policy changes that could positively impact our=20
bottom line.  For instance, we could push through regulatory action for a=

I don't disagree that these risks which I am trying to track are business=

cy=20
(taxes, export/import, rates, etc.).  Because Enron is actively participati=

Finally, it is my understanding that Govt Affairs needs to be involved in=

Regulatory Risk Working Group has identified the following set of=20
responsibilities for Govt Affairs:

_ To identify Regulatory Risks within current assets.=20

_ To recommend alternative commercial arrangements to reduce Regulatory Ris=

_ To assess and compute =01&value at risk=018 for each Regulatory Risk.
_ To develop transfer mechanisms for Regulatory Risk (e.g., insurance).
_ To propose and/or plan mitigation devices for Regulatory Risks.
_ To assign EGA and/or commercial responsibility and resources for mitigati=

efforts.
_ To review mitigation efforts against existing plans.
_ To advocate regulatory frameworks which reduce Regulatory Risk (e.g., BIT=

_ To prevent catastrophic Regulatory Risk events (> $25 MM).=20
_ To report to Enron management global Regulatory Risk position.=20

Mark --

Thanks for the additions.  I will add to the Asset / Responsibility Matrix.

The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of=20
Sovereign Risk (with the other element being Political Risk).  Regulatory=
=20
Risk is a ""legal"" action taken by a government or its agent which modifies=
=20
Enron's business environment, most often directly through modifications in=

the energy and communications markets, but also in broad areas such as taxe=
s=20
and export - import policies.  Political Risk is a ""supra-legal"" action tha=
t=20
has the same impact (e.g., expropriation).

Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group (Fiona Grant is member) is tryi=
ng=20
to put in place a ""standard"" process to review and analyze regualtory risk=
=20
around the globe - quite an undertaking.  When I use the term Regulatory Ri=
sk=20
Management, I am primarily talking about such a process.  The key elements =

any risk management function are (1) identification, (2) assessment, (3)=20
mitigation / transference, and (4) audit.  You would probably agree that th=
e=20

sk=20
event.  The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an=20

My goal is to try an have this process in place by mid-year.  That would=20

I spoke with Frank Davis in Houston yesterday about this PA and he agreed 
that Houston PCG would ensure that this customer was reviewed in Houston and 
set up as soon as possible.  I have also confirmed with Frank and Amita 
Gosalia the situation with regards to responsibilities for Japan when 
processing PAs.  Japan has always been the responsibility of the Houston PCG 
except in the case of metals customers which are approved by credit and legal 
in London.

It would seem that this is an issue that needs to be discussed further 
between the London, Houston and Australia groups to establish responsibilites 
further. Hopefully this will ensure that this type of confusion does not 
occur again and delay the processing of a customer application.

Your note flagged something for me.  I assume the Nancy McFadden mentioned in 
the article hails from the Clinton administration.  I ""sorta"" worked with 
Nancy when she was at the Department of Transportation.  She would remember 
me, at least.  If you ever need to explore this contact, let me know.  
Otherwise I am glad to let sleeping dogs rest.

5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were

The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed 
late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of 
interest involving their official duties and personal finances. 
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, 
according to state records.
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator 
whose stock they owned. 
In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from 
her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential 
conflicts was handled. 
Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the 
conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file 
required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which 
included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants ""may have 
crossed the line,"" said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests. 
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could 
undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most 
influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements 
that led to the firings. 
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in 
promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state 
bond sale in U.S. history. 
The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman 
have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the 
$12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The 
companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through 
with the purchase of utility transmission lines. 
Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a 
separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political 
reform laws. Critics question the distinction. 
""The governor's approach may be convenient for him,"" said Jim Knox, executive 
director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, ""but it ignores the 
law."" 
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that ""decisions are 
not being made by people who have a conflict of interest,"" Knox said. ""Trying 
to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to 
be doing."" 
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding 
the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration 
as it rushed into the power trading business this year. 
More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according 
to state records. 
In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government 
ethics laws. 
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even 
basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The 
state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly 
within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. 
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the 
circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key 
information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to 
state when they bought the energy stocks. 
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of 
interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a 
Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the 
governor of ""a conscious policy of secrecy"" in enforcing compliance with 
public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 
4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine 
The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San 
Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 
billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said 
they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More 
than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine 
in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records 
available. 
""We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these 
stocks,"" the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an 
interview. 
The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a 
$500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power 
and negotiating contracts, records show. 
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed 
owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had 
participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could 
not be reached for comment. 
The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, 
Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be 
reached Friday by The Times. 
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a 
now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early 
days of California's electricity deregulation. 
Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts 
calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, 
including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern 
California. 
Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him 
that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the 
stock a week ago. 
He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and 
saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value 
each time. 
Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team 
Thursday and fired. 
""I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't 
give me an answer,"" Mead said. ""[He] just said your services are terminated. 
""I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the 
lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger 
pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and 
we're the pawns."" 
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other 
traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work 
for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power 
Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after 
disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office 
said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. 
Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, 
in her final days working at the electricity exchange. 
A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal 
to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. 
On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state 
and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. 
One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. 
The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power 
for up to 20 years. 
In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others 
reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And 
two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility 
that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. 
Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power 
plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after 
deregulation. 
Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, 
said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly 
before he began work for the state Feb. 28. 
Purchase of Enron Stock Defended 
""I don't see a conflict,"" he said. ""At the time, we weren't really dealing 
with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron."" 
Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict 
until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or 
lose his job. 
That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. 
""We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the 
highest ethical standards,"" he wrote. ""That standard is not met by those who 
hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on 
behalf of the state on energy related matters."" 
""Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must 
divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she 
refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person."" 
However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with 
his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. 
Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la 
Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not 
have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not 
consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of 
projects. 
Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including 
the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters 
and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the 
record. 
Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, 
prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval 
of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. 
Pact Specifies Financial Advice 
The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to 
provide ""financial advisory services"" to the state. 
The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings 
stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and 
Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like 
the other two firms, it too was hired to provide ""financial advisory 
services"" to the state. 
That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the 
administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power 
company interests. 
The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a 
longer contract.

Oh, the irony. You build your security systems to protect internal
systems from outside intruders, then someone inside the company decides
to play cyber-vandal.

Last week, authorities charged Abdelkader Smires with launching denial-
of-service attacks against his own employer, New York-based Internet
Trading Technologies, Inc. (ITTI). Smires was upset that ITTI did not
meet his demands for a raise and more stock options. He used computers
at a Kinko's Copy store and a local university to launch his revenge
attacks against ITTI that disrupted the company's trading systems for
three days.

""He and the other programmer were involved in writing the software, so
he knew just where to attack. He was fully familiar with weaknesses in
the code,"" said Eric Friedberg, computer and telecommunications crime
coordinator for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn, N.Y., in an
interview with Computerworld ""Although it was a potentially disastrous
attack for the company, it wasn't a highly sophisticated attack.""

Another interesting article to check out is ""The service-pack shuffle
ruffles a lot of feathers"" in this week's issue of Network World
(http://www.nwfusion.com/archive/2000/83305_03-20-2000.html). My

release of service packs, which seem to be replacing quality assurance
at the companies developing our enterprise software.


But with no bugs, there would be no newsletter, so on with the latest
patches and alerts.


Cisco Secure PIX Firewall FTP vulnerabilities

Cisco announced that its PIX Firewall has a problem interpreting FTP
commands, allowing inappropriate access through the firewall. The
announcement covers two vulnerabilities: One when the firewall receives
an error from an internal FTP server and the second when a client inside
the firewall visits an external site and selects a link that the
firewall interprets as two commands. One of the commands inadvertently
opens a connection through the firewall.

Patch available for ""OfficeScan DoS & Message Replay"" vulnerability

Trend Micro has released a new version of OfficeScan Corporate Edition -
Version 3.51 - that eliminates two security vulnerabilities found on
previous versions. Previous versions of OfficeScan allow intruders
within a firewall to initiate a denial-of-service attack on the
OfficeScan client (tmlisten.exe) as well as to capture OfficeScan
commands.  These commands can be replayed and used to change other
OfficeScan client configurations.

IE and Outlook 5.x allow executing arbitrary programs using .eml files

Georgi Guninski has found yet another flaw in Microsoft's popular

Sojourn search engine exposes files

The Cerberus Security Team has discovered a weakness in the commercial
search engine, Sojourn, that allows attackers to read any local file on
the file system that they have read access to (as provided by the
account the Web server is running under). As such, files such as
/etc/passwd on Unix systems can be read and files such as the
global.asa on Windows NT and 2000. No patch was available as of this

Problem with AIX 4.x linker

The Sendmail Consortium is warning of a problem with the AIX 4.x linker.
According to the advisory, unlike most other linkers, the AIX linker
uses the paths specified at compile time for the program's shared
library search path at run time.  Therefore, AIX compilations that use
the -L flag with the AIX linker must use extra precautions to prevent
security problems. This problem is not specific to Sendmail and can
affect other applications. IBM claims it is aware of the problem and
provides workarounds.

Oracle Web Listener 4.0.x

The Cerberus Security Team has discovered a number of issues with
Oracle's Web Listener, part of Oracle Application Server (OAS), which
allow a remote attacker to run arbitrary commands on the Web server. As
part of the default installation, OAS creates an ows-bin virtual
directory that is a cgi-bin equivalent. According to Cerberus, this
directory not only contains a number of batch files, DLLs and
executables but also the binary image file for the Listener itself,
which could lead to malicious users executing commands on the server
with special query strings. No patch is available yet, though Cerberus
recommends removing the ows-bin directory or point to a more benign
directory.

kreatecd local root compromise

TESO has found a vulnerability within the kreatecd application for
Linux. An attacker can gain local root-access. Halloween Linux Version 4

Probably no need to reiterate here (it just makes me feel better), but the =
date of the bill signing or September 1 is MUCH MUCH preferable to EES. We =
have substantial contracts that we executed at the end of August.

This ruling clarifies that respondents and parties should not delay making =
=20
proposals on curtailment and other issues.? He directs that, ""respondents =
=20
and parties should, within seven days of the date of this ruling, file and=
=20
serve  proposals that address each of the four items in Ordering Paragraph =
1=20
of the  Rulemaking, including curtailment issues:
(a)? ""the role of customers on  a utility=01,s interruptible tariffs to ens=

Further, to the extent proposals filed  December 4, 2000 do not address=20

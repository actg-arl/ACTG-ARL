While cells possess the capacity for de novo serine biosynthesis, most transformed cancer cells heavily depend on exogenous serine uptake to sustain their growth, yet the regulatory mechanisms driving this metabolic dependency remain poorly understood. Here, we uncover a novel mechanism by which Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), often overexpressed in prostate cancer, orchestrates a metabolic shift in serine and lipid metabolism through the phosphorylation of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the rate-limiting enzyme of the serine synthesis pathway (SSP). We demonstrate that PLK1 phosphorylates PHGDH at three specific sites (S512, S513, S517), leading to a marked reduction in its protein level and enzymatic activity. This downregulation of SSP forces cancer cells to increase their reliance on exogenous serine uptake via the ASCT2 transporter, which, in turn, fuels the biosynthesis of lipids, including sphingolipids essential for tumor growth and survival. Targeting the SSP, serine uptake, or downstream lipid biosynthetic pathways may offer promising therapeutic avenues in PLK1-high advanced cancers.",NA,biorxiv

Automation has improved various stages of this process, from compound procurement to data analysis, supporting small molecules, peptides, and oligonucleotides. However, challenges remain, particularly in the time-consuming analysis of samples for metabolite identification.

This article introduces new algorithms for automated Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS) data applicable to both small and macromolecules. While methodologies for small molecules are well established, adapting them for macromolecules presents challenges, including computational demands, peak detection complexities, and visualization issues.

A data analysis employing diverse algorithms in the data preprocessing step was conducted across six datasets, ranging from small/medium linear or macrocyclic peptides to oligonucleotides with natural and unnatural monomers. Two peak detection approaches were evaluated: using the monoisotopic mass versus the most abundant isotope for mass calculation. Additionally, an exploration of two distinct structure visualization options was conducted for one of the datasets. Furthermore, data obtained through two different acquisition modes was processed. The computational time required for data processing was recorded throughout, ranging from 5 minutes to 2 hours per experiment. The results have been compared against prior studies, revealing substantial reductions in processing time, consistent identification of degradation products, and improved visualization techniques, thereby enhancing result interpretation.

A comprehensive identification of 970 metabolites was achieved under varied incubation conditions across the six datasets, showcasing the workflows efficiency in managing experimental data within a molecular range from 700 to 7630 Daltons (Da). Particularly in larger molecules, the most abundant mass algorithm demonstrated higher scores and a greater number of matches, instilling greater confidence in the accurate prediction of metabolite structures. It has been illustrated how the visualization algorithm for macromolecules allows the combination of monomer and atom/bond notation, facilitating a clear depiction of metabolic changes in the molecular structure.",NA,biorxiv

We report a novel AS event observed in the diabetic kidney - AS of the apoptosis gene BCL-X to increase the pro-apoptotic BCL-XS and decrease the anti-apoptotic BCL-XL. This study aimed to further investigate the role of this novel AS event in the pathogenesis of DN.

To characterize important splicing events in progression of DN, human glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) were exposed to a diabetic environment for 1 week and RNAseq was performed. While several splicing changes have been discovered we have focused further on the apoptosis gene BCL-X isoforms.

In GEnCs, an upregulation of the BCL-XS/BCL-XL ratio was observed which resulted in an increase in GEnC apoptosis. An upregulation of IL-6 was also observed; treatment with IL-6 alone induced a dose-dependent shift in BCL-X splicing to promote expression of the pro-apoptotic BCL-XS. Furthermore, we identified certain splicing factors, SF3B1 and PTBP1, involved in the BCL-X splicing regulation. A switch in expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-XL isoform rescues apoptosis, suggesting a possible therapeutic avenue. In patients, an increase in the pro-apoptotic BCL-XS in urinary RNA correlated with a decline in the GFR, while in blood it correlated with the level of albuminuria.

There is an increase in the pro-apoptotic BCL-XS isoform in the diabetic glomerular endothelium, resulting in increased GEnC apoptosis. Increased BCL-XS expression correlates with a markers of renal function decline, implicating this AS event as a potential biomarker for DN severity and suggesting that the switch of isoforms from BCL-XS to BCL-XL may for a novel therapeutic strategy.",NA,biorxiv

The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of carbapenemase genes and patterns of antibiotic resistance in isolates of B. cepacia and A. sobria. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Ramadi Teaching Hospitals in the Al-Anbar Governorate in 2024. Various study samples, were used to collect the studied bacteria. The antibiotic resistance was detected by the VITEK(R)2 System. The presence of carbapenemase genes was confirmed via PCR technique. In this investigation, seventy-five (75) isolates of A. sobria and B. cepacia were assessed. Of these, A. sobria made up 16.6% (n = 20) while B. cepacia accounted for 45.8% (n = 55). The study isolates showed highest antimicrobial resistance to piperacillin, cefepime, ceftriaxone (100%), ceftazidime (97.3%), and lowest antimicrobial resistance to imipenem (36%). The result showed 55/57 recA gene positive for differentiated B. cepacia complex from other Burkholderia spp. The overall prevalence of carbapenemase genes was 92.8%% (52/56) with blaKPCaccounting for 80.8% (42/52) and blaGES for 19.2% (10/52) of the total. The 42 B. cepacia isolates that tested positive for carbapenem resistance were constituted of 38 blaKPC (n = 38) and two blaGES (n = 2); in contrast, four blaKPC(n = 4) and eight blaGES (n = 8) were present in the A. sobria isolates that tested positive for carbapenems resistance. None of isolates studied tested positive for the blaIMPgene. The recent study concluded that recA gene identification was more sensitive and specific technique for detection B. cepacia complex isolates. There was a notable predominance of blaKPC and blaGEScarbapenemase producers among the isolates under investigation. The blaIMPgene was not found in any of the research isolates.",NA,biorxiv

However, DNA metabarcoding is not without limitations, in particular regarding the quantitative relationship between sequence read abundances and species numerical abundances or biomass (i.e., quantitative performance). Variation in DNA copy numbers has been often pinpointed as a potentially important factor biasing DNA metabarcoding quantitative performance but empirical comparisons of DNA copy number variation across species remain rare. Here, we identify chloroplast DNA copy number variation (cpDNA CNV) in plants as a potentially important factor that could impact quantitative performance in DNA metabarcoding studies. Using digital droplet PCR, we quantified chloroplast copy number variation in four common high Arctic plant species and between two plant tissue types (green tissues and roots). The amount of cpDNA per unit of dry mass varied by a factor of 3 (for roots) to 7.6 (for green tissues) among species, and up to 67 when comparing cpDNA copy numbers between green and root tissues from the same species. Despite significant differences in cpDNA copy numbers among species for both green tissues and roots, the most pronounced differences in cpDNA copy numbers were clearly between the two tissue types tested. These findings suggest that variation in cpDNA copy numbers among plant species and particularly plant tissue types can be an important but underestimated factor impacting plant sequence reads abundance in DNA metabarcoding datasets. We call for more extensive cpDNA CNV referencing efforts from wild-ranging plants to improve the use of DNA metabarcoding for research and biodiversity monitoring.",NA,biorxiv

Due to their occurrence and persistence in soils, pesticide residues may have an impact on soil microbial communities and on supported ecosystem services. In this regard, the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) recently published a scientific opinion inciting to change pesticide risk assessment to better protect soil microbe-mediated processes. Climate change is another major concern for all living organisms including soil microbial community stability. Extreme climatic events, such as heat waves or heavy rainfalls, are becoming more and more frequent and their impact on soil microbial diversity and functions have already been demonstrated.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of temperature and humidity disturbances and pesticide active ingredients exposure on soil microbial community structure and functions. To this end, 250 soil microcosms were exposed to either a heat disturbance, a high humidity to mimic heavy rain, or no environmental disturbance. After three days of recovery, soil microcosms were treated with different active ingredients: clopyralid (herbicide), cypermethrin (insecticide) and pyraclostrobin (fungicide). The treatments were applied alone or in combination at 1x or 10x of the agronomical dose. We then evaluated the effects of the disturbances and the active ingredients on various microbial endpoints related to the diversity and the structure of soil microbial communities, and with a specific focus on microbial guilds involved in nitrification.

Overall, we demonstrated that the impact of environmental disturbances applied to soil microcosms, especially heat, on microbial endpoints was stronger than that of the active ingredients applied alone or in combinations. Compounded effects of environmental disturbances and active ingredients were detected, but sparsely and were of small scale for the chosen pesticides and applied doses.",10.24072/pcjournal.537,biorxiv

Discovery experiments typically utilize high-resolution analyzers while targeted workflows rely on the sensitivity and specificity of triple quadrupole systems. Recently, a quadrupole-ion trap instrument (Stellar MS) demonstrated superior performance for targeted applications compared to conventional triple quadrupoles. In this study, we expand the capabilities of this platform to multiplexed shotgun proteomics using complement reporter ion quantification in an ion trap (iTMTproC). Benchmarking experiments with defined standards show that iTMTproC achieves quantification accuracy and interference reduction comparable to MultiNotch MS3 on the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos, a dedicated quadrupole-ion trap-Orbitrap tribrid instrument optimized for this purpose. Notably, iTMTproC quantifies slightly more proteins than MultiNotch MS3. We further validate this approach through a developmental time-series analysis of frog embryos, obtaining proteomic data nearly indistinguishable from MultiNotch MS3, with slightly increased protein quantification depth. These findings significantly extend the functionality of targeted instrumentation, underscoring the versatility of quadrupole-ion trap systems and providing cost-effective access to highly accurate, multiplexed quantitative shotgun proteomics.",NA,biorxiv

The immune consequences of this chronic antigenic exposure remain poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo characterize bite-induced rash and cytokine responses to sand fly salivary proteins in humans chronically exposed to Lutzomyia longipalpis, the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas.

MethodsWe conducted a controlled human vector challenge study, exposing 15 healthy volunteers to Lutzomyia longipalpis bites multiple times over a year. We assessed bite site skin reactions and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with salivary gland extract or two immunogenic Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary proteins, LJM19 and LJL143, to measure cytokine responses and macrophage killing of Leishmania.

ResultsBite sites developed pruritic, erythematous papules consistent with a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response. PBMCs stimulated with LJM19 or LJL143 elicited TH1-polarized cytokine responses and high expression of the TH2 cytokine IL-13. LJM19 increased levels of IL-6 and IL-7, while both proteins stimulated IL-1{beta} and IFN- production. LJM19- and LJL143-mediated parasite killing by macrophages correlated with TH1 polarization. LJM19 also enhanced Leishmania killing in cells from individuals unexposed to Lutzomyia longipalpis. Two participants exhibited prominent bite site infiltration with CD4-CD8-T cells.

ConclusionsChronic exposure to sand fly bites elicits a DTH response and induces innate and adaptive cytokine responses to salivary proteins that correlate with enhanced Leishmania killing. Controlled human vector challenge studies are valuable for investigating the immunologic mechanisms driven by long-term exposure to vector salivary antigens.

Among these are Stomatin-family proteins, which are known to influence membrane stiffness and regulate ion channels, yet how they achieve these functions at the molecular level has remained elusive. Here, we report the 2.2 [A] cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human Stomatin complex in a native membrane environment. We find that Stomatin assembles into a 16-subunit ring-shaped homo-oligomer, forming a [~]12 nm-wide cage that defines a mechanically distinct, curvature-resistant membrane microdomain. While the majority of the complex exhibits C16 symmetry, the C-terminal domains adopt two alternating conformations, producing a symmetry-broken hydrophobic {beta}-barrel pore with local C8 symmetry. The membrane beneath the complex remains flat despite surrounding curvature, indicating localized membrane stiffening. The structure reveals a conserved network of inter-subunit salt bridges that stabilize the assembly. These findings provide a molecular framework for how Stomatin oligomers shape membrane architecture and mechanics, offering new insight into their roles in mechanotransduction and diseases such as nephrotic syndrome.",NA,biorxiv

However, this does not necessarily apply to somatic evolution in cancer. Many dominant mutations have been described in the so-called proto-oncogenes (OGs), while recessive mutations are typically described in tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs). Evidence indicates that mutations in X-chromosome TSGs are more likely to contribute to cancer than those in autosomal TSGs. Here, we formalize this in several dynamic models and predict, as expected, that mutations spread faster in TSGs located on the X chromosome than on autosomes (faster-X effect). Conversely, mutations in OGs spread faster on autosomes than on the X chromosome, but under high selective pressure, this difference is negligible. Published genomic screenings of cancer samples show evidence of the faster-X effect in TSGs. This pattern is observed in both sexes, suggesting that the maintenance of X-chromosome inactivation during cancer progression plays an important role in the evolution of TSGs. Strikingly, the relative mutation incidence in X-linked TSGs among females across individual studies is bimodal, with one group of studies showing a faster-X effect and another group showing similar incidences for X-linked and autosomal TSGs. This differentiation between cancer samples is not associated with the specific type of cancer or the tissue of origin. This may indicate that X-chromosome inactivation plays a differential role in the involvement of X-linked TSGs across individual cancers.",NA,biorxiv

Information on jute lignin pathway, fibre lignification and related enzymes remains limited. One such key enzyme integral to the final lignification steps is laccase (EC 1.10.3.2).

ResultsA whole-genome search of white jute (Corchorus capsularis) revealed 34 putative laccase (CcaLAC) genes. Phylogenetic analysis categorized these genes into six groups, 17 predominantly expressed in phloem tissue, 9 in leaf, and 4 in xylem and roots. The expression of several CcaLACs increased steadily from plantlet to crop harvest stage. Homology-based selection with Arabidopsis laccase (AtLACs), shortlisted CcaLACs involved in lignin polymerisation. Transcriptomics data confirmed their phloem specific expression, with some showing significantly lower expression in dlpf, a low-lignin fibre-containing white jute mutant. CcaLAC expression also responded to abiotic stresses like ABA hormone and copper heavy metal. Additionally, Ath-miR397a and Ath-miR397b target sites were predicted in 11 and 9 CcaLACs, respectively, suggesting microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation. Subcellular localization showed CcaLACs occupying multiple plant cell compartments. Protein structure predictions revealed up to 10 motifs in CcaLACs, with 18 containing transmembrane helices. Gene ontology (GO) term analysis linked CcaLACs to lignin and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.

ConclusionsBased on expression patterns under different test conditions CcaLAC28 and CcaLAC32 are strong candidates for phloem (bast) fiber lignification process in white jute. Targeted modification of these genes could enhance our understanding of lignification and facilitate the development of low-lignin jute fibres for high-value industrial applications.",NA,biorxiv

Despite being a fundamental computation, we lack explicit circuit-level models of how this is achieved. Here, we provide evidence for a cellular substrate underlying this computation in a vertebrate brain. We develop an operant thermoregulatory assay in larval zebrafish, and show that adaptive responses depend on the precise temporal coincidence between choices and contingent thermal feedback. Chemogenetic ablations reveal that the dorsal habenula (dHb), the homolog of the mammalian medial habenula, plays an essential role in this adaptive behavior. Functional and anatomical mapping of the downstream circuitry reveals that the intermediate interpeduncular nucleus (iIPN) integrates choice- and temperature-related signals, conveyed by the dHb and a prepontine hindbrain nucleus, respectively. While dHb axons exhibit a diffuse connectivity pattern, hindbrain neurons project onto specific, lateralized iIPN regions. We show that these iIPN glomeruli function as sensorimotor detectors, integrating choices and outcomes. Specifically, when a swim in a given direction is closely followed by a temperature change, iIPN activity shows increased responses. We further show that this coincidence detection, witha precise temporal profile, links an action to its subsequent sensory feedback, relies on a presynaptic mechanism within the terminal segments of dHb axons. This mechanism is mediated by GABAB-dependent modulation of dHb sensory axons by choice-related prepontine GABAergic neurons. In this study we are therefore able to link an adaptive behavior to a specific circuit mechanism.",NA,biorxiv

In the cyanobacterial circadian clock, subunits shuffling of the core clock protein KaiC is thought to synchronize the clock, though the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We developed a chromatography-based method to monitor the shuffling dynamics of hexamerization domain of KaiC (KaiC-CI) and found that ATPase activity is essential for this process. By analyzing experiment data with quantitative models, we found that KaiC-CI hexamer stochastically disassembles into two oligomers for shuffling after hydrolysis. Further, by assuming a hidden conformation for post-hydrolysis hexamers, we established an ATPase activity-dependent model that quantitatively describes the shuffling dynamics of KaiC-CI hexamers, linking the shuffling rate to ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange rates. Using this model, we estimated the shuffling dynamics of full-length KaiC with indirect experimental data. Our findings suggest that KaiCs phosphorylation states regulate nucleotide exchange rates in the CI domain, thereby modulating ATPase activity and influencing subunit shuffling. This study provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the role of ATPase activity in subunit exchange and its implications for circadian clock regulation.",NA,biorxiv

This heterogeneity is typically attributed to genetic or environmental factors. A common approach to estimating bacterial populations involves successive dilution and plating, followed by multiplying colony counts by dilution factors. This method, however, overestimates the heterogeneity in bacterial population because it conflates the inherent uncertainty in drawing a subsample from the total population with the uncertainty in the sample arising from biological origins. In other words, this approach may obscure features that may otherwise be present in the data hinting at the presence of genuine subpopulations. For example, in plate counting applied to C. elegans gut microbiota, observed multimodality is often interpreted as large host-to-host variance, while the randomness introduced by measurement is frequently ignored. To explicitly account for the uncertainty introduced by dilution and plating randomness, we introduce REPOP, a PyTorch-based library to REconstruct POpulations from Plates within a Bayesian framework. Beyond simple cases, REPOP addresses more complex scenarios, including multimodal populations and correcting the mathematically subtle, but experimentally relevant, bias introduced by excluding plates deemed too crowded to distinguish individual colonies. We demonstrate REPOPs ability to resolve distinct population peaks otherwise obscured by standard multiplication methods. Applications to both simulated and experimental datasets, including bacterial samples of different concentrations and ones from the gut microbiota of C. elegans, show that REPOP accurately recovers the underlying multimodality by properly accounting for error propagation, where naive multiplication fails.

Author SummaryIntegrating genomic datasets from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources is an area that is currently underexplored. This work develops new methodologies to integrate transcriptomic datasets from the lungs and spleen tissues infected by Francisella tularensis -- Schu4 and Live Vaccine Strain (LVS). Our objective is to identify biologically relevant gene features indicative of respiratory infection, disease severity, and bacterial dissemination to the spleen, then utilize the selected features to predict disease status using our Weighted[l] 1-norm Non-Parallel Support Vector Machines ([l]1-WNPSVM), which is trained on the lungs data and validated on the spleen data, introducing a form of transfer learning. The[l] 1-WNPSVM outperforms traditional ML techniques, achieving a 97% balanced accuracy. It also generalizes to models of similar formulations, incorporating dimensionality reduction and gene selection into the NPSVM-type framework. Currently, a direct application of existing NPSVM-type methods to analyze gene expression datasets, where the number of genes significantly exceeds the number of samples, is computationally impractical due to their large memory requirements. This work addresses this challenge. We discovered sets of 253 genes exclusively expressed in the lungs and spleen tissues. Gene ontology is performed to reveal underlying metabolic pathways. Our analysis shows that the immune system pathway is activated in both lungs and spleen.",NA,biorxiv

Some theories view remapping as the mechanism behind reduced interference between competing spatial memories, whereas others associate it with changes in an underlying latent state representation. However, it remains unclear how these interpretations of remapping relate to one another, and what types of activity changes they are compatible with. To shed some light on these questions, here we propose a neural coding and population geometry perspective to unify and elucidate the mechanisms behind remapping. Assuming that hippocampal population activity can be understood through a linearly-decodable latent space, we show that there are three possible mechanisms to induce activity changes that resemble remapping. Remapping can be due to (i) a true change in the mapping between neural and latent space, (ii) modulation of activity due to non-spatial mixed selectivity of place cells, or (iii) neural variability outside of the latent space that reflects a redundant code. We simulate and visualize examples of these remapping types in a network model, and relate the resultant remapping behavior to various models and experimental findings in the literature. Overall, our work serves as a unifying framework with which to visualize, understand, and compare the wide array of theories and experimental observations about remapping, and may serve as a testbed for understanding neural response variability under various experimental conditions.",NA,biorxiv

We showed that only one round of selection of deeply mutated sequences of a few mutations is sufficient to bring the accuracy of predicted structures to better than 2 [A] RMSD from their respective native structures for four of the five proteins experimented. The performance for three out of five proteins is even better than AlphaFold2 with naturally occurring sequences.

Reductive dehalogenase (RDase) enzymes from organohalide-respiring bacteria are essential for their remediation under anaerobic conditions. RDases are responsible for dehalogenating these chlorinated solvents, leading to their removal. This work explores the kinetic characteristics of three closely related Dehalobacter chloroalkane-reductases--TmrA, CfrA, and AcdA--and identifies differences between their activity on chloroform (CF), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), and 1,1,2-TCA. The side-by-side comparison of these enzymes has emphasized that TmrA and AcdA are specialized toward CF with both having 4-fold higher maximum specific activity (Vmax) on CF than 1,1,1-TCA, whereas, CfrA has very similar rates on both CF and 1,1,1-TCA. AcdA is the most sensitive to substrate inhibition by CF and 1,1,2-TCA, and inhibition by a common co-contaminant trichloroethene. Finally, the reduction of 1,1,2-TCA, which can produce both 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, was assessed for each enzyme. Interestingly, each enzyme has a distinct preference for the major product it produces, indicating a favoured reaction pathway. Despite over 95% sequence identity, TmrA, CfrA, and AcdA exhibit substantial differences in kinetic behaviour, highlighting the importance of understanding such nuances for informed bioremediation strategies.

We introduce mehenDi, which utilizes the tree structure from TreeTerminus for differential testing. The nodes output by mehenDi, called the selected nodes are determined in a data-driven manner to maximize the signal that can be extracted from the data while controlling for the uncertainty associated with estimating the transcript abundances.

These three loci, Teosinte crossing barrier1 (Tcb1), Gametophytic factor1 (Ga1), and Ga2, each play a key role in preventing hybridization between incompatible populations and are proposed to maintain the barrier between domesticated and wild subspecies. Each locus encodes both a silk-active and a matching pollen-active pectin methylesterase (PMEs). To investigate the diversity and molecular evolution of these gametophytic factor loci, we identified existing and improved models of the responsible genes in a new genome assembly of maize line P8860 that contains active versions of all three loci. We then examined fifty-two assembled genomes from seventeen species to classify haplotype diversity and identify sites under diversifying selection during the evolution of these genes. We show that Ga2, the oldest of these three loci, was duplicated to form Ga1 at least 12 million years ago. Tcb1, the youngest locus, arose as a duplicate of Ga1 before or around the time of diversification of the Zea genus. We find evidence of positive selection during evolution of the functional genes at an active site in the pollen-expressed PME and predicted surface sites in both the silk- and pollen-expressed PMEs. The most common allele at the Ga1 locus is a conserved ga1 allele (ga1-Off), which is specific haplotype containing three full-length PME gene copies, all of which are non-coding due to conserved stop codons and are between 610 thousand and 1.5 million years old. We show that the ga1-Off allele is associated with and likely generates 24-nt siRNAs in developing pollen-producing tissue, and these siRNAs map to functional Ga1 alleles. In previously-published crosses, the ga1-Off allele was associated with reduced function of the typically dominant functional alleles for the Ga1 and Tcb1 barriers.

Interaction niches are intimately related to the notion of trait matching, which posits that a species interacts preferentially with partners whose traits are complementary to their own.

Multivariate methods are commonly used to quantify species environmental niches (or Grinnellian niches). More recently, some of these methods have also been used to study the interaction niche, but they consider only the niche optimum and require trait data.

In this paper, we use the correspondence analysis (CA) framework to study interaction networks and investigate trait matching without requiring traits data, using the notion of latent traits. We use reciprocal scaling, a method related to CA, to estimate niche optima and breadths, defined respectively as the mean and standard deviation of latent traits of interacting partners in CA space. We present the method, test its performance using a simulation model we designed, and analyze a real mutalistic bird-fruits interaction network.

The simulation study shows that the method is able to recover niche breadths and optima for data generated with parameters values typical of ecological networks. The bird-fruit network analysis shows strong relationships between species niche optima and niche breadths: a posteriori correlation with species traits suggests that this latent structure is related to measured traits. In this network, birds and plants of intermediate size tend to have the widest niches and birds with pointed wings (preferentially foraging in the canopy) have smaller niches than birds with rounded wings (preferentially foraging in the understory).

CA and reciprocal scaling are described as fruitful exploratory methods to characterize species interaction profiles, provide an ecologically meaningful graphical representation of interaction niches and explore the effect of latent traits on network structure.",NA,biorxiv

This study delves into the bacterial-fungal dynamics in severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) among 61 children aged 3-4 years with complete deciduous dentition. We evaluated environmental factors such as saliva pH, buffering capacity, and trace elements (iron, fluoride). We examined the performance of 16S rRNA V1-V9 regions gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers for bacteria and fungi from plaque and saliva to characterize community compositions and diversity. Saliva pH and buffering capacity were also measured. Findings revealed significant shifts in bacterial diversity in S-ECC saliva samples, marked by decreased diversity and elevated abundance of cariogenic species, particularly Streptococcus mutans. Candida albicans was notably more prevalent in the S-ECC group, implicating its potential role in pathogenesis. Iron and fluoride concentrations showed no significant correlation with microbial community structure. Network analyses uncovered complex intra- and inter-kingdom interactions, underscoring cooperative and competitive dynamics. S-ECC children exhibited higher abundances of bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Granulicatella, Actinomyces) and fungi (Candida albicans), with specific microbial taxa associated with reduced saliva pH.

ImportanceThis study illuminates the intricate relationship between bacteria and fungi within the oral microbial community of children, specifically highlighting differences between those with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) and those without caries. Through an extensive analysis of the microbial composition in both saliva and dental plaque, we identified a significant increase in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa (e.g., S. mutans, Granulicatella, Actinomyces) and fungal species (e.g., C. albicans) in the oral cavities of children with S-ECC. This finding underscores the potential role of these microorganisms in the development of caries.

Contrary to previous studies that emphasize the importance of iron and fluoride in oral health, our research found no significant correlation between the concentrations of these elements and the composition of oral microbial communities. This result challenges conventional understanding and opens new avenues for future research. Additionally, we discovered an association between certain microbial species and reduced salivary pH, offering fresh insights into the relationship between the oral microenvironment and caries development.

The implications of our findings are substantial for the development of prevention and intervention strategies targeting childhood caries. They also underscore the critical need for a deeper exploration of oral microbial interactions and their environmental influences.",NA,biorxiv

However, such a role has remained unclear due to difficulties in purifying adequate amounts of cofactor-bound protein. The [FeFe]-hydrogenase-like protein has two conserved binding sites for [4Fe-4S] clusters, one of which is predicted to be a labile site for cluster transfer to downstream targets. Here, we report a new preparation procedure for Nar1 that facilitated studies by UV-Vis, EPR, and Mossbauer spectroscopies, along with native mass spectrometry. Nar1 recombinantly produced in E. coli contained a [4Fe-4S] cluster, bound presumably at site 1, along with an unexpected [2Fe-2S] cluster bound at an unknown site. Fe/S reconstitution reactions installed a second [4Fe-4S] cluster at site 2, leading to protein with three Fe/S cofactors. Strikingly, one [4Fe-4S] cluster was rapidly destroyed by molecular oxygen, potentially linking Nar1 oxygen sensitivity to phenotypes observed previously in vivo. These advances now allow for the pursuit of in vitro Fe/S cluster transfer assays, which will shed light on Fe/S trafficking by CIA components and how they may facilitate the insertion of [4Fe-4S] and potentially [2Fe-2S] clusters into target proteins in the cytosol.",NA,biorxiv

ObjectiveTo identify molecular subtypes of neuroticism and examine their association with ADRD traits.

DesignThree ongoing cohort studies were used; Religious Orders Study (ROS), Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), that began enrollment in 1994, 1997, and 2004, respectively.

SettingOlder priests, nuns, and brothers from across the U.S. (ROS), older adults (MAP) and older African-American adults (MARS) from across the greater Chicago metropolitan area.

Participants1,028 decedents with multi-omic data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (AC), and the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG).

Exposure(s)Eight layers of omics (DNA methylation and histone acetylation from DLPFC; RNA seq from AC, DLPFC, and PCG, single-nucleus RNA, TMT proteomics and metabolomics from DLPFC) and Neuroticism using the 12-item version from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory.

Main outcome(s) and measure(s)Person-specific multi-omic molecular pseudotime representing molecular progression from low to high phenotypic expression of neuroticism, and three multi-omic brain molecular subtypes of neuroticism which represent distinct omic pathways from no/low neuroticism to high neuroticism that differ by their omic constituents.

Participants are exclusively assigned to the subtype which aligns mostly with their multi-omic profile.

ResultsThe top drivers of subtype differentiation were transcriptomic alterations across three brain regions (DLPFC, AC, PCG) which extensively and differentially characterized the subtypes. The subtypes were also differentially associated with AD pathology, temporal lobe atrophy, and AD dementia, with subtype N1 showing the strongest associations.

Conclusions and RelevanceNeuroticism may be driven by three distinct molecular subtypes, with subtype N1 driving ADRD-related associations, N2 showing some ADRD associations, and N3 being completely independent of these outcomes. Our data provide novel insights into the biology of individual differences in predispositions of neuroticism and its associations with ADRD traits.

The evidence from the Dinaledi Subsystem, and at other locations across the Rising Star cave system may widen the phylogenetic breadth of mortuary, and possibly funerary, behaviors.

Polymyxin B (PMB) based combination therapy is considered as a best alternative treatment for those middle and low-income countries that cannot access to the latest medicines. Its crucial to know both phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of a pathogen to understand the killing effect of each drug and its combinations. Hence, our objective of this study was to incorporate mechanistic insights gained from resistance mechanisms to develop a mechanism based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model (MBM). Six clinical CRKP isolates were used for static concentration time kill (SCTK) assays to evaluate the rate and extent of killing by monotherapy, double and triple combinations using PMB, meropenem and fosfomycin. A MBM was developed using the SCTK data in S-ADAPT. The MBM estimated lower maximum killing rate constant of PMB (3.61 h-{superscript 1}) in an isolate with non-functional MgrB and high-level phenotypic resistance. Based upon model discrimination and PMBs outer membrane disruption, mechanistic synergy was included in 3 isolates which has porin mutations. Mechanistic synergy of PMB was 83-88% with meropenem and 81-98% with fosfomycin. The PMB concentration required to achieve 50% of synergy was 0.48-0.64 mg/L. Simulations with a lower PMB regimen (1mg/kg q12h) and fosfomycin (8g q8h) showed >73% reduction in area under the bacterial load-versus-time curve for four isolates. The triple combination showed 67.7% reduction in non-carbapenamase producing isolate. This study demonstrates that a low dosing regimen of PMB can produce synergistic effects in combination therapy and might be effective in managing infections caused by CRKP, including PMB resistant isolates.

Author summaryAntimicrobial resistance is a major concern in treating infectious diseases. CRKP bacterial isolates are resistant to most of the novel antimicrobial agents. One of the primary resistant mechanisms is restricting the permeability of drugs to the site of action. Polymyxin B, an antimicrobial agent, disrupts the bacterial outer membrane, enhancing the permeability of other drugs. When using combination therapy with polymyxin B, selecting drugs with different mechanisms of action is crucial to enhance synergistic effects and improve treatment efficacy. In our study we chose to evaluate the efficacy of meropenem and fosfomycin in double and triple combination therapies. Mechanism based models (MBMs) are the strongest tool to analyse the time course bacterial load data. Our study provides insights into applying available phenotypic and genotypic information to refine and enhance the accuracy of MBMs. Final model simulations revealed that low exposure of polymyxin B below the nephrotoxic threshold was sufficient to produce synergistic effects when combined with fosfomycin and meropenem. Additionally, we found that polymyxin B combination with fosfomycin was more effective compared to meropenem in treating CRKP.",NA,biorxiv

Yet, therapeutics targeting mutant forms of chromatin-modifying enzymes have yielded only modest clinical utility, underscoring the difficulty of targeting the epigenomic underpinnings of aberrant gene regulatory networks. Here, we sought to identify novel epigenetic vulnerabilities in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Through phenotypic screens and biochemical analysis, we demonstrated that inhibition of the H3K9 demethylases KDM4A and KDM4C elicits potent, subtype-agnostic cytotoxicity by antagonizing transcriptional networks associated with B-cell identity and epigenetically rewiring heterochromatin. KDM4 demethylases associated with the KRAB zinc finger ZNF587, and their enzymatic inhibition led to DNA replication stress and DNA damage-induced cGAS-STING activation. Broad surveys of transcriptional data from patients also revealed KDM4 family dysregulation in several other cancer types. To explore this potential therapeutic avenue, we performed high-throughput small molecule screens with H3K9me3 nucleosome substrates and identified novel KDM4 demethylase inhibitors. AI-guided protein-ligand binding predictions suggested diverse modes of action for various small molecule hits.

Despite recent progress, the detailed molecular mechanism of DNA translocation in concert with the ATP-driven conformational changes of the complex remains to be clarified. In this study, we elucidated the mechanisms of SMC action on DNA using all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We first created a near-atomic full-length model of a prokaryotic SMC-kleisin complex based on experimental structures and implemented ATP-dependent conformational changes using a structure-based coarse-grained model. We further incorporated key protein-DNA hydrogen bond interactions derived from fully atomistic simulations. Extensive simulations of the SMC complex with 800 base pairs of duplex DNA over the ATP cycle observed unidirectional DNA translocation by the SMC complex. The process exhibited a step size of [~]200 base pairs, wherein the SMC complex captured a DNA segment of about the same size within the SMC ring in the engaged state, followed by its pumping into the kleisin ring as ATP was hydrolyzed. Analysis of trajectories identified the asymmetric path of the kleisin as a critical factor for the observed unidirectionality.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRing-shaped SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) protein complexes, which are highly conserved across all three domains of life, play an essential role in chromosome organization through a process called DNA loop extrusion. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the ATP-dependent motor activity of SMC complexes remains unclear. Using all-atom and residue-resolution coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we revealed that prokaryotic SMC complexes translocate unidirectionally along DNA via a segment capture mechanism. We found that the unidirectionality arises from the kleisin subunit breaking the symmetry of the ring-shaped SMC complex structure. Our findings provide insights into the molecular motor mechanisms shared by SMC complexes.",NA,biorxiv

In the gastrointestinal tract, this transport indirectly impacts nutrient absorption. However, the mechanisms governing ion transport through these channels remain poorly understood. We addressed this question by building on our previous cell culture studies and all atom molecular dynamic simulation model of CLDN15. By mutating D55 to a bulkier glutamic acid (E) or neutral amino acid asparagine (N), our in vitro measurements showed that the D55E mutation decreased charge selectivity and favored small ion permeability, while the D55N mutation led to reduced charge selectivity without markedly altering size selectivity. By establishing a simplified (reduced) CLDN15 molecular dynamics model that excludes non-essential transmembrane regions, we were able to probe how D55 modified cation dehydration, charge interaction, and permeability. These results provide novel insight into organization of the CLDN15 selectivity filter and suggests that D55 plays a dual role in shaping both electrostatic and steric properties of the pore, but its electrostatic role is more prominent in determining CLDN15 cation permeability. This knowledge can be used toward the development of effective strategies to modulate CLDN15 function. The experimental approach established can be further extended to study the function of other claudin channels. Together, these advancements will help us to modulate tight junctions to promote human health.

To investigate the effects of neuromodulation and proprioceptive sensory afferents in the spinal cord, a biologically constrained spiking neural network (SNN) was developed. The network describes the flexor motoneuron (MN) reflex loop with inputs from ipsilateral Ia- and II-fibres and tonically firing interneurons. The model was tuned to a baseline level of locomotive activity before simulating an inhibitory-dominant and body-weight supported (BWS) SCI state.

Taste is an important cue used by animals to explore their external environment and can modulate various aspects of animal behavior and physiology. A major ongoing challenge for animals is to detect and respond to the presence of a variety of pathogens in their environment. However, to date, the links between the sensory system and the response to pathogenic threats remain poorly understood. Here we show that Drosophila larvae use their taste system to detect bacterial peptidoglycans in their environment and respond by modulating the activity of their cellular immune system. We show that specific PeptidoGlycan Receptor Proteins (PGRPs) act in bitter taste neurons, via the IMmune Deficiency (IMD) pathway. These PGRPs mediate signaling in taste neurons and control immune cells production in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. The taste-mediated sensing of bacteria in larvae primes the immune system, and improves survival after infection in adult flies. These results demonstrate that sensory inputs such as taste play an important role in protecting animals from bacterial infection by providing a powerful adaptive response to potential pathogens.

Here, we experimentally confirm this phenomenon occurs when temperatures increase within temporal windows of hours to days, consistent with field observations7,8. Through microscale measurements of dissolved oxygen in the diffusive boundary layers of two abundant, keystone reef-building corals, we demonstrate that rapid temperature increases coincide with intrinsic oxygen deprivation, occurring before gross tissue disintegration or coral tissue sloughing. We propose that this distinct phenomenon arises from rapid heating, rendering the coral holobiont incapable of engaging in reactive processes to counteract the combined effects of heightened aerobic demands and impaired photosynthetic function. The passive diffusion of O2 from the surrounding bulk water is likely insufficient to meet the holobionts requirements, as explained by the Einstein-Smoluchowski kinetic theory of gases and Brownian motion9,10. These insights into coral tissue sloughing underscore the complexity of holobiont responses to stress and biophysical consequences of heatwaves. A granular understanding of these mechanisms is urgently needed, particularly regarding how heating rates may change under future climate scenarios, to re-evaluate the potentially under-recognised threats facing coral reefs.",NA,biorxiv

Diatoms contribute 20% of global photosynthesis3 while disproportionately representing 40% of carbon export4, with most export occurring along the continental margins5. Oxylipin chemical signaling by diatoms has been extensively studied in the Mediterranean Sea where oxylipins are linked to grazing with subsequent insidious effects on copepod reproduction6-13. Culture studies with diatoms have shown that stress, growth phase, and viral infection also impact oxylipin production14-16. This study provides the first glimpse into the role of oxylipins as biomarkers and chemical signals during diatom viral infection at sea. Biomarkers for lysis and senescence were identified in laboratory experiments and observed at elevated concentrations in meta-lipidomes collected in the California Coastal Ecosystem (CCE) where diatoms had recently been lysed by viruses17. Deck-board incubations with natural communities showed that oxylipins stimulate particle-attached and surface-ocean microbes in a dose and community-dependent manner, while inhibiting microzooplankton grazing and phytoplankton growth rates. Carbon export was two times higher at the Post-lytic site than elsewhere along the transect consistent with the viral shuttle, whereby viruses facilitate carbon export. We previously reported enhanced enzymatic activity at the Post-lytic site17, suggestive of the viral shunt, whereby carbon is remineralized or attenuated into non-sinking dissolved organic matter. Here we layer geochemical evidence to show that lysis of oxylipin producing diatoms amplified the vertical flux of carbon from the surface ocean even in the presence of viral shunt processes. The remineralization length scale and community composition have been hypothesized as controls on shunt vs. shuttle18-20; our analysis provides another example of how community interactions may toggle a system between favoring shunt or shuttle.",NA,biorxiv

Theta is modulated by running speed, breathing, whisking, and jumping and increases in tasks involving memory encoding or retrieval. The positive relationship between theta frequency and running speed is believed stabilize hippocampal representations of space amid movement variability. Here, we incorporated a novel string-pulling task to determine if established relationships between movement and theta hold when progress to a reward is determined by the length of string pulled. This task eliminates many speed-associated inputs, such vestibular, visual, and hindlimb information, and allows an unprecedented level of precision in the analysis of individual paw movements. Given that animals move the string a fixed length to acquire a reward, we predicted that the positive relationship between theta frequency and speed would hold.

ApproachFive Sprague Dawley rats (4 mo.) were trained to continuously pull a string a fixed distance of 208 cm using an automated string-pulling system and run on a track for food reward. Local-field data was acquired from electrodes in dorsal CA1.

ResultsRelationships between theta and movement speed were distinct during string pulling and running. While theta was robust in both conditions, frequency was significantly reduced during string-pulling and showed no speed-frequency coupling, unlike running. This difference could result from the conflict between hindlimb and forelimb signals, with only forelimb movement signaling advancement. Fine-grained analysis of paw movements during string-pulling (lift, advance, grasp, pull, push) revealed that theta power and frequency peaked during the contralateral paws downward push despite paw speed being low during this action. This suggests that theta frequency and power could respond to effort rather than purely kinematic information. Notably, running-associated theta may similarly reflect both speed and effort as most locomotor tasks conflate these variables. Finally, theta phase aligned from one reach-pull cycle to the next during the downward pull motion - the first action that directly advances the string forward. Since phase-locking has been associated with sensorimotor gating, synchrony at this point could reflect the gating of inputs that are the most causally relevant for reaching the reward, potentially facilitating integration of action-outcome signals for memory encoding and navigation. Taken together, these data support a dual-scale view of hippocampal processing and theta-band activity where macroscale theta activity requires suprathreshold sensory, vestibular, and proprioceptive drive and microscale theta remains sensitive to subsecond limb movements.",NA,biorxiv

Mice with impaired B cell receptor (BCR) signaling have significantly increased IgE responses, consistent with a role for BCR signaling in IgE regulation. While prior work focused on BCR signaling in IgE-expressing cells to explain these findings, it has been reported that BCR signaling can reduce CSR. Therefore, we investigated the possibility that IgE CSR might be particularly sensitive to inhibition by BCR signaling in unswitched B cells. We found that immunization of mice with high-affinity antigen resulted in reduced representation of IgE-expressing cells among germinal center B cells and plasma cells relative to a low-affinity antigen. Mechanistic experiments with cultured mouse B cells demonstrated that BCR ligands selectively inhibited IgE CSR in a dose-, affinity-, and avidity-dependent manner. Signaling via Syk was required for the inhibition of IgE CSR following BCR stimulation, whereas inhibition of the PI3K subunit p110{delta} increased IgE CSR independently of BCR ligation. The inhibition of IgE CSR by BCR ligands synergized with IL-21 or TGF{beta}1. BCR ligation also inhibited CSR to IgE in human tonsillar B cells, and this inhibition was also synergistic with IL-21. These findings establish that IgE CSR is uniquely susceptible to inhibition by BCR signaling in mouse and human B cells, with important implications for the regulation and pathogenesis of allergic disease.",NA,biorxiv

Using 3D skin equivalents, a JEB mouse model and JEB patient samples we confirmed changes in epidermal lipid synthesis, which was further explored using lipidomics. Cholesterol biosynthesis genes were increased with loss of Laminin-332 in vitro, however a decrease in immunofluorescence lipid staining was observed. Cholesterol transport in Laminin-332 knockdown keratinocytes was revealed to be disrupted, which in keratinocytes is dependent on the actomyosin network.

However, the recent failure of ceperognastat in a Phase II trial--marked by accelerated cognitive decline in the treatment arm--has raised concerns about the safety of this therapeutic class. Here, we evaluated the acute synaptic effects of three structurally distinct OGAi (ceperognastat, ASN90, and MK8719) in mouse hippocampal slices. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that all three compounds impaired both short- and long-term synaptic plasticity, as evidenced by reduced paired-pulse facilitation/depression and suppressed long-term potentiation.

Immunohistochemistry showed altered synaptic protein levels, with increased PSD-95 and reduced Synaptophysin 1 in neurons, alongside a biphasic shift in Tau phosphorylation. These findings indicate that OGAi produce rapid and convergent synaptotoxic effects across pre- and postsynaptic compartments, likely reflecting a class-wide mechanism.

As the number and scale of snATAC-seq datasets increases, we need robust computational pipelines to integrate samples within a dataset and datasets across studies. These integration pipelines should correct cell-state-obfuscating technical effects while conserving underlying biological cell states, as has been shown for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) pipelines. However, scRNA-seq integration methods have performed inconsistently on snATAC-seq datasets, potentially due to sparsity and genomic feature differences.

ResultsUsing single-nucleus multimodal datasets profiling ATAC and RNA simultaneously, we can measure snATAC-seq integration method performance by comparison to independently integrated snRNA-seq gold standard embeddings and annotations. Here, we benchmark 58 pipelines, incorporating 7 integration methods plus 1 embedding correction method with 5 feature sets. Using our command-line tool, we assessed 5 multimodal datasets at 3 different resolutions using 2 novel metrics to determine the best practices for multi-sample snATAC-seq integration. ATAC features outperformed Gene Activity Score (GAS) features, and embedding correction with Harmony was generally useful. SnapATAC2, PeakVI, and ArchRs iterative Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) performed well.

Of these, only 7, all from animal-associated cluster 1, have been experimentally verified as secretins of cargo, including adhesins, hemophores, and metal binding proteins. To identify novel cargo of a more diverse set of T11SS, we identified gene families co-occurring in gene neighborhoods with either cluster 1 or marine microbe-associated cluster 3 T11SS OMP genes. We developed bioinformatic controls to ensure perceived co-occurrences are specific to T11SS, and not general to OMPs. We found that both cluster 1 and cluster 3 T11SS OMPs frequently co-occur with single carbon metabolism and nucleotide synthesis pathways, but that only cluster 1 T11SS OMPs had significant co-occurrence with metal and heme pathways, as well as with mobile genetic islands, potentially indicating diversified function of this cluster. Cluster 1 T11SS co-occurrences included 2556 predicted cargo proteins, unified by the presence of a C-terminal {beta}-barrel domain, which fall into 141 predicted UniRef50 clusters and approximately 10 different architectures: 4 similar to known cargo and 6 uncharacterized types. We experimentally demonstrate T11SS-dependent secretion of an uncharacterized cargo type with homology to Plasmin sensitive protein (Pls). Unexpectedly, genes encoding marine cluster 3 T11SS OMPs only rarely co-occurred with the C-terminal {beta}-barrel domain and instead frequently co-occurred with DUF1194-containing genes. Overall, our results show that with sufficiently large-scale and controlled genomic data, T11SS-dependent cargo proteins can be accurately predicted.

Impact StatementWe describe a novel method for controlling genomic neighborhood analyses and use this controlled co-occurrence technique to examine two distinct clusters of genes from the recently described type 11 secretion system (T11SS): Cluster 1, predominantly encoded by host-associated microbes and Cluster 3, encoded by marine microbes. We found that both clusters of predicted T11SS frequently co-occur with single carbon metabolism and nucleotide synthesis pathways, but only the host-associated cluster co-occurred with iron uptake pathways. Using these datasets, we predicted 2687 T11SS dependent cargo with approximately ten unique architectures, six of which have not previously been linked to T11SS. Finally, we validate our results by demonstrating T11SS-dependent secretion of a cargo protein with one of the novel architectures, plasmin-sensitive surface protein Pls from Haemophilus parahaemolyticus.

Previous investigations on hematophagous (blood-feeding) arthropod vectors, including mosquitoes, have indicated that ingesting blood containing inhibitors of the second enzyme in the tyrosine metabolism pathway, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), results in high insect mortality. Building upon this foundation, we evaluated the insecticidal efficacy of the HPPD inhibitor, nitisinone, against susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of three mosquito species: Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. These mosquitoes are vectors of historical diseases such as malaria, emerged diseases such as Dengue and Zika and emerging viral diseases such as the Oropouche and Usutu viruses. We demonstrate, by employing standard screening assays designed to assess the cuticular uptake of mosquitocidal agents, that nitisinone has mosquitocidal activity when blood-fed mosquitoes contact a nitisinone-coated surface. Notably, there is no discernible disparity in susceptibility to nitisinone between an insecticide-susceptible strain of Anopheles gambiae and two strains carrying multiple insecticide-resistance mechanisms. We conclude that the mosquitocidal mode of action of nitisinone differs from any of the current 37 classes of insecticides as none have a mode of action that specifically interferes with blood digestion. By highlighting the efficacy of nitisinone as a contact-based insecticide, our findings support the potential expansion of vector control strategies where nitisinone is incorporated into classic interventions like treated bednets and indoor residual spraying.",NA,biorxiv

However HHIPs role in COPD pathogenesis remains elusive. Canonically, HHIP is a negative regulator of the hedgehog pathway and downstream GLI1 and GLI2 activation. The hedgehog pathway plays an important role in wound healing, specifically in activating transcription factors that drive the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), which in its intermediate state (partial EMT) is necessary for the collective movement of cells closing the wound. Herein, we propose a mechanism to explain HHIPs role in faulty epithelial wound healing, which could contribute to the development of emphysema, a key feature of COPD. Using two different Boolean models compiled from the literature, we show dysfunctional HHIP results in a lack of negative feedback on GLI, triggering a full EMT, where cells become mesenchymal and do not properly close the wound. We validate these Boolean models with experimental evidence gathered from published scientific literature. We also experimentally test if low HHIP expression is associated with EMT at the edge of wounds by using a scratch assay in a human lung epithelial cell line. Finally, we show evidence supporting our hypothesis in bulk and single cell RNA-Seq data from different COPD cohorts. Overall, our analyses suggest that aberrant wound healing due to dysfunctional HHIP, combined with chronic epithelial damage through cigarette smoke exposure, may be a primary cause of COPD-associated emphysema.

Although supervised deep-learning-based models offer accurate segmentation, their performance degrades for unknown cell types. To address this problem, unsupervised domain adaptation methods based on adversarial training, self-training, or a combination of these approaches have been developed in recent years. These methods train the model using inference labels from the unknown domain as pseudo labels with reliability to resolve the discrepancy between the features of the unknown and known domains. However, conventional methods require a predefined threshold to calculate pseudo-labels reliability, leading to costly hyperparameter tuning. Here, we developed an unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic cell segmentation with cooperative self-learning (CULPICO: Cooperative Unsupervised Learning for PIxel-wise COloring) that does not require predefined threshold of the pseudo-labels reliability. The proposed method consists of two independent segmentation models and a mutual exchange mechanism of inference data. The models infer a label probability at each pixel and generate a pseudo-label as unsupervised learning. The pseudo-labels created by each model are mutually used as ground truth in the other model. Loss function is corrected by considering pixel-level discrepancies between the label probabilities inferred by the two models. The proposed method, despite being an unsupervised learning method, can segment efficiently the unknown cell types without labels with an accuracy comparable to supervised learning models. Our method, which could solve the performance degradation problem without constructing new datasets, is expected to accelerate life science by reducing the cost of extracting quantitative biological knowledge.",NA,biorxiv

How the ChREBP-MLX hetero-tetramerization is achieved and regulated, remains poorly understood. Here we show that MLX phosphorylation on an evolutionarily conserved motif is necessary for the heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE and the transcriptional activity of the ChREBP-MLX complex. We identified CK2 and GSK3 as MLX kinases that coordinately phosphorylate MLX. High intracellular glucose-6-phosphate accumulation inhibits MLX phosphorylation and heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE, impairing ChREBP-MLX activity.

We present a genomic surveillance study of 551 An. stephensi sampled across the invasive and native ranges in Africa and Asia. Our findings support a hypothesis that an initial invasion from Asia to Djibouti seeded separate incursions to Sudan, Ethiopia, and Yemen before spreading inland, aided by favourable temperature, vegetation cover, and human transit conditions.

Data were partitioned by circadian and ultradian phase before quantification of within-state transition probabilities and between-state serial correlations. Within each joint circadian-ultradian phase, short-term statistical patterns were identified, with quantitative variation between phases. Statistical ""signatures"" of sleep-wake pattern include positive serial correlations between durations of contiguous states, and between state bouts and inter-bout intervals. There was no correlation between wake bout duration and subsequent sleep episode duration, contradicting an oft-cited assumption of the sleep homeostasis hypothesis. The data confirm a positive correlation between the duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and duration of the subsequent inter-REM interval, which is traditionally interpreted as evidence for a short-term REM homeostat. The present study concludes that the REM homeostat hypothesis is underdetermined. It is suggested that this serial correlation and other sleep-wake patterns can be explained by an alternative non-homeostatic mechanism; transition probability prevailing at the end of a state episode is carried over to the beginning of the next state (""inter-state transition momentum""). The plausibility of this hypothesis was supported by preliminary simulations using a 2nd-order 3-state semi-Markov model.

Lab studies showed such effects in psychophysical judgements of location, but also in action-tasks, like predicting motion and intercepting. Given that similar underlying processes have been proposed for some of these biases, we tested for a shared mechanism by correlating them across observers. Using the classical implied motion sequence, participants either indicated the remembered location of an intermittently presented dot consistently  moving from one location to the next, or intercepted a predicted future location of the same intermittently presented dot. We examined whether the errors in those tasks are associated by correlating i) the overall amount of overshooting, and ii) the effect of temporal manipulations of the  jump duration on these biases across participants. We found two medium correlations indicating that these two biases are indeed related to each other. Participants who show a larger effect in one task also show a larger effect in the other task, and participants with larger proneness to temporal features show them consistently across both tasks. This suggests a shared underlying mechanism, and theoretical implications are discussed.",NA,biorxiv

However, whether the human alpha rhythm is a correlate of time perception itself has remained controversial. This study combined EEG with multiple duration perception tasks to evaluate whether individual alpha frequency (IAF) is associated with sensitivity or bias in judging visual durations across a range of peri-second durations (spanning 100-1200ms). In a temporal estimation task, participants (n = 55; 38 female, 13 male, 4 non-binary) reported the duration of a single stimulus between 300-1200ms. In a temporal discrimination task, participants reported which of two stimuli was longer: a standard (100, 600, or 1200ms) or comparison (50-150% of the standard). Stimuli also varied in whether their luminance was static or dynamically varying over time. We found that IAF was significantly related to the variance of duration estimates, a precision measure, but not average duration estimates, a bias measure. Further supporting this relationship, psychometric function slopes obtained from the independent duration discrimination tasks were positively correlated with IAF, particularly for the static stimulus conditions. These individual differences effects held when controlling for participant age. We also explored trial-level variability in alpha frequency and found it was predictive of shifts in the point of subjective equality (PSE) during discrimination of very short (100ms). Taken together, these results suggest that IAF plays a role in shaping individual differences in the sensitivity of time perception and that spontaneous variations around ones IAF can lead to a bias in temporal representations.

Significance StatementBrain waves in the 8-13 Hz range, known as alpha waves, have long been hypothesized to modulate our perception of time, yet the evidence remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between an individuals alpha frequency (IAF) and temporal sensitivity using a wide range of time perception tasks and stimulus durations to address gaps in the literature. We demonstrate that IAF is significantly associated with the precision of duration estimates and sensitivity in duration discrimination, particularly for static unchanging stimuli. These findings provide novel evidence that IAF shapes individual differences in time perception, emphasizing its role as a neural marker of temporal sensitivity.",NA,biorxiv

Additionally, it is considered a traditional dominant cash crop in China. Therefore, analyzing the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of climate sustability of H. citrina in current and future climatic conditions is crucial for its stable industry development in China. Method: ENMTools was used to screen the data of 287 distribution points of H. citrina. 37 environmental variables affecting the distribution of H. citrina were selected, the MaxEnt model and Geographic Information System (ArcGIS) were used to simulate the potential distribution patterns of H. citrina in 5 periods (current, future 2040 s, 2060 s, 2080 s, and 2100 s), and the dominant climate factors affecting the distribution of H. citrina were analyzed through contribution rate, displacement importance value, and jackknife test. Results: (1) The average AUC value of 10 cross-validated fits under the ROC curve for the training dataset was 0.933, and the average AUC value of 10 cross-validated fits for the test dataset was 0.901, this indicates that the simulation stability and reliability are highest when incorporating all three types of environmental variables. (2) The main environmental factors identified affecting their distribution include the lowest temperature of the coldest month, average temperature of the coldest quarter, slope, elevation, and carbonate or lime content, as determined by the contribution rate of cutting method, displacement contribution rate, and single factor response curve. (3) The model prediction showed that H. citrina was widely distributed in 34 provincial regions of China under the current climate conditions, with a suitable area of 646.81 km2. (4) Under the future emission scenarios, the suitable habitat for H. citrina is projected to shrink and not shift to higher latitudes, indicating a negative impact of climate warming on its distribution, which will reduce the suitable habitat and narrow the ecological niche. Temperature and precipitation have been identified as important factors affecting the distribution of H. citrina. Although H. citrina's suitable habitat is expected to decrease to varying degrees in the future, the distribution area is relatively stable and there will still be a broad natural habitat in the future. Conclusion: The species distribution model was used to predict the future temporal and spatial distribution of climate-suitable areas for H. citrina in China. Based on the model's simulation results, it is recommended that north and southeast China become the main planting areas for H. citrina in the future, with Sichuan and other regions as key development areas.

ObjectiveThis study aims to fill this gap by using high-density scalp electroencephalogram (hd-EEG) as a common read-out to compare human brain responses to TMS and IES.

MethodsThe dataset includes TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) acquired from healthy subjects (n=22) and IES-evoked potentials (IEPs) recorded from drug-resistant epileptic patients (n=31) during wakefulness. In a subset of subjects TEPs (n=12) and IEPs (n=13) were also recorded during NREM sleep. Amplitude, spectral, and spatiotemporal features of TMS and IES responses, as well as their estimated electrical fields, were compared.

ResultsWe observed marked differences between TMS and IES responses. During wakefulness, IEPs are considerably larger, slower and associated with a suppression of cortical activity, whereas TEPs are characterized by multiple waves of recurrent activation. These differences are attenuated during NREM, during which both TMS and IES elicit large EEG responses associated with a prominent suppression of cortical activity. At the global level, the spatiotemporal complexity of the responses to both TMS and IES decreases consistently following the transition from wakefulness to NREM sleep.

ConclusionDespite the limitations due to different subject populations (healthy vs pathological), our findings provide a first reference to parallel non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation and to interpret their differential effects. They also offer important insight on how cortical responsiveness is shaped by inhibition and adaptation mechanisms depending on input parameters and brain states.

Highlights- IES evokes higher signal-to-noise EEG responses than TMS.
- IES responses are larger, slower, and lead to cortical suppression.
- TMS elicits faster recurrent waves, with no suppression during wakefulness.
- Both TMS and IES converge to similar patterns during NREM sleep.",NA,biorxiv

MethodsThe toolbox was designed to maximize user flexibility and contains artifact, applied, input/output (I/O), and support functions. The artifact functions can produce spurious echoes, eddy currents, nuisance peaks, line broadening, baseline contamination, linear frequency drifts, and frequency and phase shift artifacts. Applied functions combine or apply specific parameter values to produce recognizable effects such as lipid peak and motion contamination. I/O and support functions provide additional functionality to accommodate different kinds of input data (MATLAB FID-A .mat files, nifti-mrs files), which vary by domain (time vs. frequency), collection type (edited vs. non-edited) and scale.

ResultsUsers may provide some or all of the required artifact function parameter values which will result in artifacts of different appearances. Visual assessment confirms the resemblance of simulated compared to in vivo produced artifacts.

Recently, the high-resolution structure of a purified human caveolin assembly, the CAV1-8S complex, revealed a unique organization of 11 protomers arranged in a tightly packed, radially symmetric spiral disc. One face and the outer rim of this disc are highly hydrophobic, suggesting that the complex incorporates into membranes by displacing hundreds of lipids from one leaflet. The feasibility of this unique molecular architecture and its biophysical and functional consequences are currently unknown. Using Langmuir film balance measurements, we find that CAV1-8S is highly surface active and intercalates into lipid monolayers. Molecular simulations of biomimetic bilayers support this  leaflet replacement model and reveal that while CAV1-8S effectively displaces phospholipids from one bilayer leaflet, it accumulates 40-70 cholesterol molecules into a disordered monolayer between the complex and its distal lipid leaflet. We find that CAV1-8S preferentially associates with positively curved membrane surfaces due to its influence on the conformations of distal leaflet lipids, and that these effects laterally sort lipids of the distal leaflet. Large-scale simulations of multiple caveolin assemblies confirmed their association with large, positively curved membrane morphologies, consistent with the shape of caveolae. Further, association with curved membranes regulates the exposure of caveolin residues implicated in protein-protein interactions. Altogether, the unique structure of CAV1-8S imparts unusual modes of membrane interaction with implications for membrane organization, morphology, and physiology.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECaveolae are membrane invaginations heavily implicated in cellular physiology and disease; however, how their unique shape and function are produced remains enigmatic. Here, following on recent characterization of the unusual structure of the CAV1-8S oligomer, we examine the molecular details of its interactions with its solvating lipid membrane. We describe a novel mode of membrane interaction--which we term  leaflet replacement--for the CAV1-8S complex that has not previously been observed for any other protein. The biophysical consequences of this unique molecular organization provide mechanistic insights into the functions and organization of caveolae in cells.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we implemented a serial dependence paradigm by randomly perturbing pitch of auditory feedback in a sequence of trials to dissociate the effects of sensory errors and motor compensation on current production. We found that error-based motor compensation in preceding trials, rather than sensory errors, attracted the compensatory responses in the current trial. Critically, this serial dependence remained across difference lexical categories but only when the consecutive productions were in the same syntactic structure.

Mutations that overcome such challenges can be identified through adaptive laboratory evolution. We evolved the anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris to use formate as the sole carbon source. Through gene deletions, we determined that formate is assimilated via oxidation to CO2 by formate dehydrogenase followed by CO2 fixation by the Calvin cycle. However, this pathway had no clear link to three genes that were commonly mutated in evolved isolates: (i) ribB, a flavin synthesis enzyme, (ii) ppsR2, a repressor of light-harvesting genes, and (iii) RPA0893, a regulator of unknown function. A RibB mutation was necessary and sufficient for formate assimilation and improved formate oxidation. PpsR2 mutations occurred early, facilitated formate assimilation, and caused elevated pigmentation. Pigment production generates CO2 and alkaline conditions that, along with intracellular chromatophore membranes, could represent a rudimentary but important CO2-concentrating mechanism. RPA0983 mutations emerged late and facilitated formate assimilation. RPA0983s proximity to a CO2-liberating pigment synthesis gene suggests a similar effect as PpsR2 mutations.

Male mice were tested under different conditions to assess whether hunger, time of day, or the caloric content of the solution they were given affected histamine fluctuations. We found that histamine levels changed rapidly in response to eating. These histamine fluctuations were influenced by experimental conditions, with slightly smaller responses when the test solution was sucralose (both regions) or during the light cycle (PVH only). Notable regional differences were identified, such that in the PVH histamine rebounded to baseline levels, whereas in the VMH histamine remained lower than baseline for at least 10 seconds after licking ceased. In a separate cohort of male and female mice, enhancing histamine tone via administration of a histamine precursor (L-histidine) reduced the number of licks across multiple sucrose concentrations.

Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) is a key oxidoreductase responsible for detoxifying reactive aldehydes. Pharmacological activation of ALDH2 using Alda-1, a selective agonist, has been shown to reduce aldehyde accumulation, alleviate inflammation, and enhance functional recovery in experimental SCI models. However, approximately 8% of the global population carries the ALDH2*2 mutation, which severely impairs this detoxification pathway. In this study, we used a transgenic ALDH2*2 mouse model to investigate the role of ALDH2 in SCI pathology. This model mimics the human ALDH2*2 condition, allowing us to examine the impact of impaired aldehyde clearance on acrolein accumulation and its pathological consequences. We modulated endogenous aldehyde detoxification through both genetic deficiency and pharmacological activation with Alda-1. Our results showed that ALDH2 deficiency led to significantly elevated acrolein levels, which were associated with increased microglial activation, cytokine storm, neuronal loss, demyelination, and tissue damage compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Treatment with Alda-1 enhanced ALDH2 activity and significantly reduced acrolein levels in both ALDH2*2 and WT mice from 2 to 28 days post-SCI. This was accompanied by reduced inflammation, improved preservation of myelin, and marked improvements in locomotor and sensory function, especially in ALDH2*2 mice. Notably, even beyond the traditionally ideal treatment window, Alda-1 treatment remained effective in promoting recovery, particularly in motor function and to a greater extent in ALDH2*2 mice.

When faced with selection pressure like antifungal exposure, this hidden genetic diversity can provide a reservoir of adaptive mutations through loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events. Validating the potential phenotypic impact of LOH events observed in clinical or experimentally evolved strains can be difficult due to the challenge of precisely targeting one allele over the other. Here, we show that a CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used to overcome this challenge. By designing allele-specific guide RNA sequences, we can induce targeted, directed LOH events, which we validate by whole-genome long-read sequencing. Using this approach, we efficiently recapitulate a recently described LOH event that increases resistance to the antifungal fluconazole. Additionally, we find that the recombination tracts of these induced LOH events have similar lengths to those observed naturally. To facilitate future use of this method, we provide a database of allele-specific sgRNA sequences for Cas9 that provide near genome-wide coverage of heterozygous sites through either direct or indirect targeting. This approach will be useful in probing the adaptive role of LOH events in this important human pathogen.",NA,biorxiv

Endemic to Madagascar, their small and highly fragmented populations make them particularly vulnerable to both genetic disease and anthropogenic environmental changes. Over the past decade, conservation genomic efforts have largely focused on inferring and monitoring population structure based on single nucleotide variants to identify and protect critical areas of genetic diversity. However, the recent release of a highly contiguous genome assembly allows, for the first time, for the study of structural genomic variation (deletions, duplications, insertions, and inversions) which are likely to impact a substantial proportion of the species genome. Based on whole-genome, short-read sequencing data from 14 individuals, >1,000 high-confidence autosomal structural variants were detected, affecting [~]240 kb of the aye-aye genome. The majority of these variants (>85%) were deletions shorter than 200 bp, consistent with the notion that longer structural mutations are often associated with strongly deleterious fitness effects. For example, two deletions longer than 850 bp located within disease-linked genes were predicted to impose substantial fitness deficits owing to a resulting frameshift and gene fusion, respectively; whereas several other major effect variants outside of coding regions are likely to impact gene regulatory landscapes. Taken together, this first glimpse into the landscape of structural variation in aye-ayes will enable future opportunities to advance our understanding of the traits impacting the fitness of this endangered species, as well as allow for enhanced evolutionary comparisons across the full primate clade.",NA,biorxiv

Hence, to understand the evolution of species diversity and their persistence, it is crucial to understand how gene flow and evolution of reproductive isolation shape groups of closely related species. Using resequencing data, we disentangle here genomic patterns of divergence and introgression in five Formica rufa group wood ant species that are at the early stage of speciation. We first revise earlier mitochondrial phylogenies with a nuclear genomic tree, and demonstrate then introgression that is in line with observations of their current day natural hybridisation. Investigating the genome-wide differentiation and divergence we find correlations between population genetic parameters of divergence, differentiation, and diversity, that are in line with theoretical expectations for young species. Despite previously found evidence for polygenic species barriers, our data lacks the genome-wide correlation between differentiation and divergence that would be expected under a model of polygenic barriers. The likely explanation for this lack is the dominating effect of ancestral diversity at these early stages of speciation. As hybridisation has led to both deleterious and adaptive consequences within the group, we examined the signatures of introgression. We find no strong positive correlation between introgression and recombination, suggesting introgression does not have a predominantly deleterious effect. We also infer low diversity in the genomic regions with high proportions of introgression, consistent with the idea that selection has locally favoured introgression. This could be due to sharing of adaptive alleles or reduction of genetic load in the receiving species. Interestingly, gene flow in this group could potentially cross multiple species boundaries even in the absence of direct interbreeding between all the species. We discuss the long-term benefits and costs of introgression in young species, including the effect of environmental fluctuations and multi-species introgression.",NA,biorxiv

The main objective of the current work was to identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in stomach adenocarcinoma in order to advance translational medicine and patient outcomes. By accomplishing this objective, the research seeks to provide significant insights into the field of translational medicine. Seven novel unfavourable prognosis-associated genes (NALCN, CALCR, CPT1C, ELAVL3, FLJ16779, MYOZ3, and TPST1) were first identified. Additionally, 41 potential miRNAs were predicted. ELAVL3-hsa-mir-29a-3p and CALCR-hsa-mir-29a-3p axes were identified as two critical pathways in the carcinogenesis of stomach adenocarcinoma via a bioinformatics analysis. Following that, lncRNAs binding to hsa-mir-29a-3p were predicted via starBase and miRNet databases for predicting lncRNA binding sites. After conducting both expression and survival analyses for these predicted lncRNAs, we found that only one lncRNA (KCNQ1OT1) was markedly overexpressed in stomach adenocarcinoma, and its elevated expression was associated with an unfavourable prognosis. Next, we established a comprehensive mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA triple ceRNA network linked to the prognosis of patients with stomach adenocarcinoma.

Using extensive simulations, we show that this method provides improved estimates of coalescence times and lead to more accurate inferences of effective population sizes under a wide range of demographic assumptions. It also improves other downstream inferences including estimates of mutation rates.

Its attachment to and detachment from cargo are mediated by adaptor molecules. Vac17, a vacuole-specific adaptor, links Myo2 to Vac8 on the vacuole membrane, and plays a key role in the formation and dissociation of the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex. Using genetics, cryo-electron microscopy and structure prediction, we find that Vac17 interacts with Myo2 through two distinct sites rather than a single interface. Similarly, the peroxisome adapter Inp2 engages two separate regions of Myo2, one of which overlaps with Vac17. These findings support a ""handhold"" model, in which cargo adaptors occupy multiple sites on the Myo2 tail, enhancing motor-cargo interactions and likely providing additional regulatory control over motor recruitment.

SummaryThis study provides insights into how cargo adaptors bind myosin V.

However, existing methods often overlook individual differences in whole-cortex network organization. Furthermore, in some personalized TMS protocols, a lower stimulation intensity is used for targets closer to the scalp. Therefore, near-scalp targets might improve patient tolerance.

ObjectiveWe develop an algorithm to simultaneously optimize FC and scalp proximity for personalized target localization.

MethodsWe use the multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) to estimate high-quality individual-specific cortical networks. A tree-based algorithm is then used to select the optimal target location. By essentially having no parameter to tune, our framework might improve generalizability across populations. We compare our approach to existing ""cluster"" and ""cone"" algorithms in terms of scalp proximity, test-retest reliability, and FC to brain regions implicated in depression.

ResultsIn two test-retest datasets of healthy individuals from the United States and Singapore, tree-based MS-HBM reliably identifies personalized TMS targets for depression in close proximity to the scalp. These targets compare favorably with cone and cluster targets in terms of reliability, scalp proximity, and FC to the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in new out-of-sample MRI sessions from the same individuals. Compared with the cluster algorithm, tree-based MS-HBM targets hypothetically reduce stimulation intensity by 12% using a linear intensity adjustment protocol. To demonstrate versatility, we apply the same algorithm, without having to tune any parameter, to identify personalized TMS targets for anxiety.

ConclusionThe tree-based MS-HBM algorithm provides a robust, generalizable framework to estimate near-scalp personalized targets across different populations.",NA,biorxiv

VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain.

Author SummaryVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) causes brain inflammation in both animals and humans when transmitted by mosquito bite or infectious aerosols. The mechanisms underlying disease caused by VEEV, including the role of the immune response in brain pathology, are not well understood. Here we performed a comprehensive assessment of the immune response to VEEV in the brain over time using two advanced sequencing techniques. Following infection, immune cells infiltrate the brain in a sequential fashion and display different activation profiles. Different types of immune cells also display strikingly different spatial patterns throughout the brain. This study provides the most comprehensive description of the immune response to VEEV in the brain performed to date and advances our understanding of immune-driven neuropathology and identification of therapeutic targets.",NA,biorxiv

Using two-photon optogenetics, we measure neural responses to natural images and play them back, finding inputs are amplified when played back during the correct movie dynamic context-- when the preceding sequence corresponds to natural vision. This sequence selectivity depends on a network mechanism: earlier input patterns produce responses in other local neurons, which interact with later input patterns. We confirm this mechanism by designing sequences of inputs that are amplified or suppressed by the network. These data suggest recurrent cortical connections perform predictive processing, encoding the statistics of the natural world in input-output transformations.",NA,biorxiv

We employed inducible Cre (iCre) mouse models to target specific cell populations including c-kitCreERT2 to target interstitial cells of Cajal like cells; Pdgfr{beta}CreERT2 to target pericyte-like cells; PdgfrCreERTMto target CD34+ adventitial cells; and Myh11CreERT2to target lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) directly.

Further, optogenetic depolarization with ChR2 only induced propagated contractions in LMCs. Membrane potential recordings in LMCs demonstrated that the rate of diastolic depolarization significantly correlated with contraction frequency.

Self-focus can be adaptive, helping individuals fulfill their needs. It can also go haywire, with maladaptive self-focus a risk and maintenance factor for internalizing disorders like depression. Yet, the drive to focus on the self remains to be fully characterized. We discovered a brain state that when spontaneously brought online during a quick mental break predicts the desire to focus on oneself just a few seconds later. In Study 1, we identified a default network neural signature from pre-trial activity that predicts multiple indicators of self-focus within our sample. In Study 2, we applied our neural signature to independent resting-state data from the Human Connectome project. We found that individuals who score high on internalizing, a form of maladaptive self-focus, similarly move in-and-out of this pattern during rest, suggesting a systematic trajectory towards self-focused thought. This is the first work to ""decode"" the bias to focus on the self and paves the way towards stopping maladaptive self-focus in its course.

Why are people so preoccupied with themselves? Our results suggest self-focus may emerge spontaneously because of the brain state people enter in the default network as soon as they have a mental break. The brain state participants entered in the first few seconds of rest could be used to decode whether they next chose to focus on themselves, as well as subjective and neural markers of self-focus.

These complexes are composed of transcription factors from the MYB and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) families along with a tryptophan-aspartate repeat (WDR) scaffold protein (MBW complexes). The MYB member has been found to be the most pathway-specific component of the complex and modifications to these MYB genes are overrepresented in studies investigating the genetic basis of changes in pigmentation phenotypes across flowering plants. Here we investigated the orthologues of the MBW complex in a divergent lineage to understand its origin and evolution. We found evidence that these transcriptional complexes also form in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, indicating, together with an analysis of published gene family phylogenies, that they are ancestral to land plants. The functions of each of the two orthologous MYB genes, MpMYB14 and MpMYB02, both depend on the single orthologous bHLH gene, MpbHLH12. We could not assess the functional role of the WDR genes in M. polymorpha, due to low mutant recovery suspected to be caused by pleiotropic effects on viability. We propose that the two transcriptional complexes with alternative MYB paralogues in M. polymorpha represent an ancestral function, regulation of the flavonoid pathway, and a derived function, maturation of liverwort-specific oil bodies. Our findings imply a replicated pattern by which new complexes have evolved in independent land plant lineages, through duplication of the evolutionarily labile MYB member and co-option of its interaction partners.",NA,biorxiv

Similar HPMLs have been observed in largemouth bass (M. nigricans) since the 1980s. Here, we report a close association between novel adomaviruses and the hallmark blotchy clinical presentation of hyperpigmented lesions on the skin smallmouth and largemouth black bass and provide evidence that satisfies Rivers postulates. The two adomaviruses are structurally and phylogenetically similar but share only 68.0% identity at aligned nucleotide sites and each has been found in only one host species to date. The manifestation of this skin disease appears to be seasonal in both species, primarily affects adults and is of unknown health consequence. Although the significance of infection to fish health remains unclear, understanding the disease ecology of these can inform biosecurity and the interjurisdictional movement of individuals.

Staphylococcus aureus nuclease (MNase) is particularly interesting due to its thermostability and Ca2+-dependence, making it the prime choice for applications where nuclease modulation is critical, such as ribosome profiling in bacteria and halophilic archaea. The latter poses a technical and economical challenge: high salt reaction conditions are essential for maintaining ribosome integrity but negatively impact the MNase activity, necessitating using large amounts of nuclease to achieve efficient cleavage. Here, we set out to generate an optimized production protocol for two forms of MNase -- fully processed MNaseA and the 19 amino acid propeptide-containing MNaseB -- and to biochemically benchmark them against a commercial nuclease. Our results show that both MNases are highly active in normal reaction conditions, but MNaseA maintains higher enzymatic activity in high salt concentrations than MNaseB. MNaseA also retains >90% of its activity after multiple freeze-thaw cycles when stored at -80 {degrees}C in a buffer containing 5% glycerol. Importantly, ribosome profiling experiments in the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii demonstrated that MNaseA produces ribosome footprints and hallmarks of active translation highly comparable to those obtained with the commercial nuclease, making it a suitable alternative for high-salt ribosome profiling applications. In conclusion, our method can be easily implemented for efficient MNaseA production, thereby providing access to an effective, robust, and cost-efficient alternative to commercial nucleases, as well as facilitating future translation studies into halophilic organisms.",NA,biorxiv

The mitoUPR is mediated by the stress-activated transcription factor ATFS-1. Constitutive activation of ATFS-1 increases resistance to exogenous stressors but paradoxically decreases lifespan. In this work, we determined the optimal levels of expression of activated ATFS-1 with respect to lifespan and resistance to stress by treating constitutively-active atfs-1(et17) worms with different concentrations of RNA interference (RNAi) bacteria targeting atfs-1. We observed the maximum lifespan of atfs-1(et17) worms at full-strength atfs-1 RNAi, which was significantly longer than wild-type lifespan. Under the conditions of maximum lifespan, atfs-1(et17) worms did not show enhanced resistance to stress, suggesting a trade-off between stress resistance and longevity. The maximum resistance to stress in atfs-1(et17) worms occurred on empty vector (0% atfs-1 knockdown). Under these conditions, atfs-1(et17) worms are short-lived. This indicates that constitutive activation of ATFS-1 can increase lifespan or enhance resistance to stress but not both, at the same time. Finally, we determined the timing requirements for ATFS-1 to affect lifespan. We found that knocking down atfs-1 expression only during development is sufficient to extend atfs-1(et17) lifespan, while adult-only knockdown has no effect. Overall, these results demonstrate that constitutively active ATFS-1 can extend lifespan when expressed at low levels and that this lifespan extension is not dependent on the ability of ATFS-1 to enhance resistance to stress.",NA,biorxiv

SYNCRIP and PCBP2 may contemporarily bind to miRNAs as demonstrated by EMSA assays and PCBP2 knock-down causes EV-loading of intracellular microRNAs.

Here, we present the first crystal structure of a Ubiquilin family Sti1 domain bound to a transmembrane domain (TMD) and show that ALS mutations disrupt the Sti1-TMD interaction. We then demonstrate that Ubiquilins contain multiple conserved, internal sequences that bind to the Sti1 domain, including the PXX region which is a hotspot for ALS mutations. We propose that these placeholder sequences prevent solvent exposure of the Sti1 hydrophobic groove and contribute to the multivalency that drives Ubiquilin phase separation.

Bacterial toxin delivery has been implicated in generating population heterogeneity, but the molecular mechanisms behind this are not well understood. Here we investigate how CdiA toxins generate heterogeneity in isogenic populations. Using a DNase toxin as proxy, we find that E. coli populations able to deliver the toxin show a heterogeneous expression of the SOS-response gene sulA. Heterogeneity results from excessive delivery of toxin into some cells, which become intoxicated due to insufficient immunity. Intoxication is transiently reversible, and intoxicated cells can be rescued by de novo synthesis of cognate immunity protein. Expression of sulA is regulated by both DNA damage and redox status. Interestingly, kin-delivery changes redox status, whereas intoxicated non-kin cells induce the SOS DNA damage response. The former results in changed expression of metabolic genes whereas the latter induces prophage excision, which may promote horizontal gene transfer. In conclusion, we identify a molecular mechanism by which heterogeneity is generated through toxin delivery among kin, and the consequences of said heterogeneity.

Significance statementBacteria communicate through secretion of chemical signaling molecules to perform multicellular behavior. Recent advances suggest that contact-mediated toxin delivery allow bacteria to participate also in direct cell-cell communication. How such toxin-mediated communication would work mechanistically is however unclear. Here we elucidate a molecular mechanism of a toxin-mediated communication, where kin-cells transiently intoxicate each other, resulting in physiological changes. These changes depend on the toxic activity, i.e. other toxins with different activities are likely to give rise to other responses. Thus, the arsenal of toxins that a bacterium harbors could affect their ability to communicate. Understanding the molecular mechanism of how toxins could mediate polyphenism is important for our understanding of what this signaling is used for.",NA,biorxiv

Our models recapitulate known associations between histone PTMs and expression patterns, including predicting that acetylation of histone subunit H3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac) near the transcription start site (TSS) significantly increases expression levels. To validate this prediction experimentally and investigate how natural vs. engineered deposition of H3K27ac might differentially affect expression, we apply the synthetic dCas9-p300 histone acetyltransferase system to 8 genes in the HEK293T cell line and to 5 genes in the K562 cell line. Further, to facilitate model building, we perform MNase-seq to map genome-wide nucleosome occupancy levels in HEK293T. We observe that our models perform well in accurately ranking relative fold-changes among genes in response to the dCas9-p300 system; however, their ability to rank fold-changes within individual genes is noticeably diminished compared to predicting expression across cell types from their native epigenetic signatures. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive genome-scale epigenome editing datasets, better understanding of the actual modifications made by epigenome editing tools, and improved causal models that transfer better from endogenous cellular measurements to perturbation experiments.

We discovered that starvation induces a reversible G1/G0 cell cycle arrest in Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells and that cell cycle re-entry upon refeeding is dependent on TOR signalling. In addition, the length of the refeeding stimulus after starvation determines the proportion of cells that re-enter S-phase. Remarkably, prolonged starvation delayed both refeeding-induced TOR signalling activation and S-phase re-entry. This strongly suggests that Nematostella Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells undergo starvation-controlled quiescence deepening, previously described only in unicellular eukaryotes and mammalian cell culture.

The specificity of T cells is determined by the sequences of the hypervariable T cell receptor (TCR)  and {beta} chains. Although bulk TCR sequencing offers a cost-effective approach for in-depth TCR repertoire profiling, it does not provide chain pairings, which are essential for determining T cell specificity. In contrast, single-cell TCR sequencing technologies produce paired chain data, but are limited in throughput to thousands of cells and are cost-prohibitive for cohort-scale studies.

Here, we present TIRTL-seq (Throughput-Intensive Rapid TCR Library sequencing), a novel approach that generates ready-to-sequence TCR libraries from live cells in less than 7 hours. The protocol is optimized for use with non-contact liquid handlers in an automation-friendly 384-well plate format. Reaction volume miniaturization reduces library preparation costs to <$0.50 per well.

The core principle of TIRTL-seq is the parallel generation of hundreds of libraries providing multiple biological replicates from a single sample that allows precise inference of both frequencies of individual clones and TCR chain pairings from well-occurrence patterns. We demonstrate scalability of our approach up to 1 million unique paired {beta}TCR clonotypes corresponding to over 30 million T cells per sample at a cost of less than $2000. For a sample of 10 million cells the cost is [~]$200. We benchmarked TIRTL-seq against state-of-the-art 5RACE bulk TCR-seq and 10x Genomics Chromium technologies on longitudinal samples. We show that TIRTL-seq is able to quantitatively identify expanding and contracting clonotypes between timepoints while providing accurate TCR chain pairings, including distinct temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific and EBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses after infection. While clonal expansion was followed by sharp contraction for SARS-CoV-2 specific TCRs, EBV-specific TCRs remained stable once established.

The sequences of both  and {beta} TCR chains are essential for determining T cell specificity. As the field moves towards greater applications in diagnostics and immunotherapy that rely on TCR specificity, we anticipate that our scalable paired TCR sequencing methodology will be instrumental for collecting large paired-chain datasets and ultimately extracting therapeutically relevant information from the TCR repertoire.",NA,biorxiv

However, while the parental virus primarily exported mature, genome-filled C-capsids, the {Delta}ORF69 mutant exhibited cytoplasmic and extracellular emergence of all capsid forms.

These findings indicate that the MHV-68 NEC functions as a quality control checkpoint, selectively facilitating the nuclear egress of mature capsids. In the absence of ORF69, some capsids still egress, likely through alternative, less efficient pathways. Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases reduced parental and mutant virus spread, suggesting that {gamma}-herpesviruses exploit host-dependent mechanisms for an alternative nuclear egress route.

ImportanceGammaherpesviruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, establish lifelong infections and can contribute to cancer. A crucial step in the viral life cycle depends on the nuclear egress of capsids, a process mediated by the viral nuclear egress complex (NEC). Surprisingly, murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) can translocate capsids from the nucleus to the cytoplasm even when a key NEC component, nucleoplasmic ORF69, is disrupted. Deleting most of ORF69 reduced viral replication but did not entirely block nuclear egress. Instead, the mutant virus allowed both mature and immature capsids to leave the nucleus, suggesting that the NEC functions as a quality control checkpoint for mature capsids. Furthermore, host cell kinases seem to enable alternative routes for egress that do not rely on the NEC. These findings further support the notion that NEC is not strictly necessary and suggest the potential exploitation of host-virus interactions for antiviral approaches.",NA,biorxiv

In this study, we sought to explore if structural connectivity of limbic networks has an association with response to ECT.

MethodsWe studied 23 patients with TRD who underwent a course of bifrontal ECT, employing probabilistic tractography at baseline to assess structural connectivity between the thalamus (THA), posterior (PCC), subgenual cingulate cortices, anterior insula (aINS), amygdala and orbitofrontal and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, hypothesizing that these hubs participate in the formation and refractoriness of depression symptoms. We also include 21 healthy subject as controls group (HC).

ResultsConnectivity between left THA and left PCC was related to both baseline depression severity (R=0.504; p= 0.017) and clinical response (R=0.452; p=0.004). Right aINS-prefrontal connectivity was associated with less clinical response. Structural connectivity was globally higher in patients than in HC (F=2.488; p=0.007).

ConclusionsThe association of ECT response with stronger structural connectivity between hubs supporting self-referential bodily experience as well as autobiographical memory encoding and retrieval deserves exploration as a predictor in persons with TRD. In turn, the right aINS is a major hub for the salience network and is involved in repetitive negative mentation. Stronger structural connectivity of this region may be a heuristically valid biomarker for refractory TRD. We discuss the potential of the present findings for the design of anatomically precise neuromodulation interventions that would be useful to treat TRD while circumventing cognitive side effects of ECT.",NA,biorxiv

This method consisted of combining a robust binary classification tool named plasmidEC with gplas2, which is a tool that makes use of features of the assembly graph to bin predicted plasmid contigs into individual plasmids. Here, we developed gplasCC, a plasmidEC-simplification, capable of classifying plasmid contigs using Centrifuge databases.

Saccades significantly impacted population representations of the probes, with early enhancement that began prior to saccades and pronounced suppression for several hundred milliseconds following saccades, independent of units visual response properties or directional tuning. To determine the cause of saccadic modulation, we presented fictive saccades that simulated the visual experience during saccades without motor output. Some units exhibited similar modulation by fictive and real saccades, suggesting a sensory-driven origin of saccadic modulation, while others had dissimilar modulation, indicating a motor contribution.

Assembly completeness evaluations showed that 98% of the BUSCO gene set is present in the A. curassavica genome assembly. The transcriptomes of six tissue types (young leaves, mature leaves, stems, flowers, buds, and roots), with and without defense elicitation by methyl jasmonate treatment, showed both tissue-specific gene expression and induced expression of genes that may be involved in cardiac glycoside biosynthesis. Expression of a CYP87A gene, the predicted first gene in the cardiac glycoside biosynthesis pathway, was observed only in the stems and roots and was induced by methyl jasmonate.

While identifying the genotype-associated changes at the single-cell level is fundamental to understanding disease pathophysiology, this remains technically challenging in human tissue samples with existing methods. Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of 20 focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) samples removed surgically for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, and 10 non-FCD controls, and we developed a new approach, Genotyping Of Transcriptomes Enhanced with Nanopore sequencing (GO-TEN), that combines targeted complementary (c)DNA sequencing with snRNA-seq to perform concurrent single-nucleus genotyping and transcriptional analysis. We find that mosaic pathogenic variants in FCD do not produce a detectable novel cell identity, but instead we observe conserved cell types present both in FCD cases and non-FCD control specimens. Similarly, GO-TEN analysis shows that most pathogenic variant-carrying cells have well-differentiated neuronal or glial identities and are enriched for layer II-III excitatory neurons. We identify cell-intrinsic disruption of glutamate and GABA-A signaling pathways in variant-carrying neurons and altered intercellular signaling, making potential mechanisms for epileptogenesis in FCD.

High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) is the most widely used method for measuring 3D genome architecture, while linear epigenomic assays, such as ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, and ChIP-seq, are extensively employed to characterize epigenomic regulation. However, the integrative analysis of chromatin interactions and associated epigenomic regulation remains challenging due to the pairwise nature of Hi-C data, mismatched resolution between Hi-C and epigenomic assays, and inconsistencies among analysis tools. Here we propose HiCFoundation, a Hi-C-based foundation model for integrative analysis linking chromatin structure to downstream regulatory function. HiCFoundation is trained from hundreds of Hi-C assays encompassing 118 million contact matrix submatrices. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple types of 3D genome analysis, including reproducibility analysis, resolution enhancement, and loop detection. We further demonstrate the models generalizability through genome architecture analysis of 316 species. Notably, by enhancing low-coverage experimental Hi-C data, HiCFoundation reveals genome-wide loop loss during differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to neutrophils. Additionally, HiCFoundation is able to predict multiple types of epigenomic activity from Hi-C input and further interprets the link between Hi-C input and epigenomic output to reveal the relationship between chromatin conformation and genome function. Finally, HiCFoundation can analyze single-cell Hi-C data, shedding light on genome structure at single-cell resolution.

Currently, only a limited number of genes effectively involved in resistance to E. amylovora have been identified.

Seeking new resistance candidates, we focused on a multigene family encoding amaranthin-like lectins, which are highly upregulated following chemical elicitation by acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM). These lectins are believed to contribute to downstream defense by promoting bacterial aggregation, which led to their designation as M. domestica agglutinins (MdAGG). When loss-of-function editions were introduced into MdAGG genes, the plants ability to mount a fully effective defense response against fire blight upon ASM treatment was compromised, confirming the role of MdAGGs in fire blight resistance. Next, we coupled the pPPO16 promoter, endogenous to apple and known to be rapidly induced during E. amylovora infection, with the coding sequence of MdAGG10 to create apple lines with fire blight-inducible MdAGG10 expression. Early MdAGG10 expression in these lines significantly improved resistance to fire blight, and an additional ASM treatment further enhanced this resistance.

In summary, we conclude that MdAGGs act as defense genes whose timely expression can provide effective resistance against E. amylovora.",NA,biorxiv

Despite decades of research, the relationship between specific IFC regions and reading skill remains unclear. To shed light on the function of IFC in reading, we aim to (1) characterize the functional landscape of text-selective responses in the IFC, while accounting for interindividual variability; and (2) examine how text-selective regions in the IFC relate to reading proficiency. To this end, children with a wide range of reading ability (N=66; age 7-14 years, 34 female, 32 male) completed functional MRI scans while performing two tasks on text and non-text visual stimuli. Importantly, both tasks do not explicitly require reading, and can be performed on all visual stimuli. This design allows us to tease apart stimulus-driven responses from task-driven responses and examine where in the IFC task and stimulus interact. We were able to identify three anatomically-distinct, text-selective clusters of activation in the IFC, in the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), and dorsal and ventral precentral gyrus (PrG). These three regions showed a strong task effect that was highly specific to text. Furthermore, text-selectivity in the IFS and dorsal PrG was associated with reading proficiency, such that better readers showed higher selectivity to text.

Understanding eclosion timing may offer insights into the circadian clock mechanisms that underlie migratory timing.

Using a custom-designed eclosion monitoring system under both 14 hours light-10 hours dark (L14: D10) and constant darkness (DD) conditions, we observed clear diel eclosion rhythms, peaking shortly after lights-off under L14: D10. Under DD, these rhythms became delayed and damped over three consecutive days, consistent with circadian control. Males exhibited more dispersed emergence patterns and distinct eclosion distributions than females under L14: D10 and DD, suggesting sexually dimorphic timing. Gene expression profiling revealed rhythmic oscillations of five canonical clock genes, cyc, clk, tim, per, cry2, with sex-dimorphic differences in mesor, amplitude, or phase, particularly the mesors of males are higher than those of females in five clock genes under L14: D10.

These results provide strong evidence for sexually dimorphic circadian regulation at both behavioral and molecular levels in a migratory insect that recently invaded China, suggesting that sex-dimorphic circadian architecture may contribute to allochronic speciation and ecological strategies such as eclosion and migratory timing in a novel environment. Leveraging the established circadian eclosion rhythm assay, which captures core features of clockwork mechanisms, further investigation may reveal how these sex-based differences contribute to the evolution of circadian function and adaptive traits.",NA,biorxiv

Electroencephalography (EEG) captures well-characterized developmental changes in peak alpha frequency (PAF) that reflect underlying neural circuit maturation and may provide a sensitive metric for mapping atypical neural trajectories in AS.

MethodWe analyzed EEG recordings from 159 children with AS (ages 1-15 years) and 185 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls. PAF was quantified using a well-established curve-fitting method applied to 1/f-corrected power spectra. To validate robustness, we further evaluated PAF using an alternative prominence-based peak detection approach across varying detection thresholds.

ResultsSignificant disruptions in PAF were evident in children with AS. While over 90% of EEGs from TD children exhibited a clear alpha peak, fewer than 50% of EEGs from children with AS showed a detectable PAF. Furthermore, when PAF was present, its frequency was significantly lower in AS children and did not show the typical age-related increases observed in TD children. Validation analyses confirmed consistently lower rates of PAF detection in AS across varying sensitivity thresholds, demonstrating the robustness of these results.

ConclusionsPAF is a robust and developmentally sensitive marker of disrupted neural maturation in children with Angelman syndrome. As a quantifiable and sensitive measure of neural disruptions in AS, PAF has the potential to complement and enhance existing clinical trial outcome assessments by providing an objective index of underlying brain function. Future analyses will explore individual differences related to PAF in AS, to better understand mechanistic insights to guide targeted therapeutic strategies.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we systematically examined the relationship between optimal electrode spacing and spike sorting efficiency by creating virtual sparser layouts from high-density recordings through spatial downsampling. We assessed spike sorting performance by comparing the quantity of well-isolated single units per electrode in sparse configurations across various brain regions (neocortex and thalamus) and species (rat, mouse, and human). Enabling the theoretical estimation of optimal electrode arrangements, we complement experimental results with a geometrical modeling framework. Contrary to the general assumption that higher electrode density inherently leads to more efficient sorting, both our theoretical and experimental results reveal a clear optimum for electrode spacing specific to species and regions. We demonstrate that carefully choosing optimal electrode distances could yield a total of 1.7 to 3 times increase in spike sorting efficiency. These findings emphasize the necessity of species- and region-specific microelectrode design optimization.",NA,biorxiv

Neural activity in both the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to represent spatial context and is sensitive to reward and rule alterations. Midbrain dopamine (DA) activity is key in reward seeking behavior and learning. There is abundant evidence that midbrain DA modulates HPC and PFC activity. However, it remains underexplored how these networks engage dynamically and coordinate temporally when animals must adjust their behavior according to changing reward contingencies. In particular, is there any relationship between DA reward prediction change during rule switching, and rule representation changes in PFC and CA1? We addressed these questions using simultaneous recording of neuronal population activity from the hippocampal area CA1, PFC and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in male TH-Cre rats performing two spatial working memory tasks with frequent rule switches in blocks of trials. CA1 and PFC ensembles showed rule-specific activity both during maze running and at reward locations, with PFC rule coding more consistent across animals compared to CA1. Optogenetically tagged VTA DA neuron firing activity responded to and predicted reward outcome. We found that the correct prediction in DA emerged gradually over trials after rule-switching in coordination with transitions in PFC and CA1 ensemble representations of the current rule after a rule switch, followed by behavioral adaptation to the correct rule sequence. Therefore, our study demonstrates a crucial temporal coordination between the rule representation in PFC/CA1, the dopamine reward signal and behavioral strategy.

Significance StatementThis study examines neural activity in mammalian brain networks that support the ability to respond flexibly to changing contexts. We use a rule-switching spatial task to examine whether the key reward-responsive and predictive dopamine (DA) activity changes in coordination with changes in rule representations in key cognitive regions, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. We first established distinct rule representations in PFC and hippocampus, and predictive coding of reward outcomes by DA neuronal activity. We show that the rule-specific DA reward prediction after a rule switch develops in temporal coordination with changes in rule representations especially in PFC, eventually leading to behavioral changes. These results thus provide an integrated understanding of reward prediction, cognitive representations of rules and behavioral adaptation.",NA,biorxiv

Application of this method in a mouse model of intestinal neoplasia revealed the biogeography of the mouse gut microbiome as function of location in the intestine, frequent strong inter-microbial interactions at short length scales, shaping of local microbiome niches by the host, and tumor-associated changes in the architecture of the host-microbiome interface.

Interpreting these systems through image segmentation requires the effective propagation and integration of information across different scales. However, most existing segmentation methods are optimised for single-scale imaging modalities, limiting their ability to capture and analyse small functional units throughout complete human organs. To facilitate multiscale biomedical image segmentation, we utilised Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT), an advanced imaging modality that can generate 3D multiscale datasets from high-resolution volumes of interest (VOIs) at ca. 1 {micro}m/voxel to whole-organ scans at ca. 20 {micro}m/voxel. Building on these hierarchical multiscale datasets, we developed a deep learning-based segmentation pipeline that is initially trained on manually annotated high-resolution HiP-CT data and then extended to lower-resolution whole-organ scans using pseudo-labels generated from high-resolution predictions and multiscale image registration. As a case study, we focused on glomeruli in human kidneys, benchmarking four 3D deep learning models for biomedical image segmentation on a manually annotated high-resolution dataset extracted from VOIs, at 2.58 to ca. 5 {micro}m/voxel, of four human kidneys. Among them, nnUNet demonstrated the best performance, achieving an average test Dice score of 0.906, and was subsequently used as the baseline model for multiscale segmentation in the pipeline. Applying this pipeline to two low-resolution full-organ data at ca. 25 {micro}m/voxel, the model identified 1,019,890 and 231,179 glomeruli in a 62-year-old donor without kidney diseases and a 94-year-old hypertensive donor, enabling comprehensive morphological analyses, including cortical spatial statistics and glomerular distributions, which aligned well with previous anatomical studies.

Innovative multimodal therapies are needed, targeting the immune system, tumor metabolism, and cell signaling. Our research focuses on the role of the actin cytoskeleton and Rho GTPases in modulating DNA damage repair and therapeutic sensitivity in GBM cells. We developed GBM sublines resistant to temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin (CP), and assessed actin stress fiber organization, Rho pathway activity, and resistance phenotype. TMZ-resistant clones exhibited increased Rho pathway activity, elevated p53 and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways, but reduced MMR protein levels. Importantly, Rho GTPase inhibition restored TMZ-resistant clones sensitivity to TMZ and CP, counteracting chemoresistance. While both drugs reduced DNA repair capacity in normal GBM cells--exacerbated by Rho inhibition--TMZ-resistant clones with overactivated Rho pathways did not show this effect. This response was p53-wild-type dependent, as p53-mutant GBM cells were unresponsive to Rho inhibition. However, p53-mutant cells treated with PRIMA-1 showed restored sensitivity to chemotherapeutics with Rho inhibition. Furthermore, modulation of the actin cytoskeleton and Rho GTPases affected sensitivity and viability in GBM spheroid models exposed to chemotherapy. In summary, Rho pathway activity and actin cytoskeleton dynamics are critical for both the development and reversal of chemoresistance in GBM tumors.

These concerns highlight the need to assess the adaptive potential of European beech populations to climate change. Landscape genomics, also known as environmental association analysis, is a powerful tool for identifying gene loci that contribute to local adaptation to environmental pressures. Genotypic data was collected from [~]100 adult beech trees per stand in five locations in the South-Eastern Romanian Carpathians along an altitudinal gradient associated with precipitation and temperature. In total, 53 environmental variables, comprising frost frequency change, temperature and precipitation, were extracted from the climatology data base CHELSA. Based on these variables the Ellenberg-Quotient (EQ) was calculated. We performed environmental association analysis using LFMM (latent factor mixed models) to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with environmental variables and with the principal components calculated based on these. We identified 446 SNP markers significantly associated with the first principal component (PC). These were overlapping with the SNP markers significantly associated with all environmental variables except precipitation accumulated during the growing season. The first PC was correlated with all temperature-based variables and elevation at |r| [~]0.989 to [~]0.997 and with all precipitation-based and Ellenberg-Quotient variables at |r| [~]0.945 to 0.950, except precipitation accumulated during the growing season. A high peak region on chromosome 2 from [~]4.56 to [~]16.27 Mb appeared in all results. This region was [~]3.47 Mb downstream from a region for local adaptation identified by Lazic et al. (2024). In this peak, 273 markers located in the coding region of 22 genes were found. Ten out these 22 were described based on a literature review. Among these ten genes, two may be involved in local adaptation based on our literature review. These two genes are polygalacturonase QRT3-like and NRT1/PTR_FAMILY 5.4-like. The gene polygalacturonase QRT3-like plays a role in pollen development in Arabidopsis thaliana L. and Brassica rapa L.

This is due in part to metabolic reprogramming that allows tumors to evade treatment. We therefore must uncover the pathways mediating these adaptations to develop novel and effective treatments. We searched for genes that are essential in GBM cells as measured by a whole-genome pan-cancer CRISPR screen available from DepMap and identified the methionine metabolism genes MAT2A and AHCY. We conducted genetic knockdown, evaluated mitochondrial respiration, and performed targeted metabolomics to study the function of these genes in GBM. We demonstrate that MAT2A or AHCY knockdown induces oxidative stress, hinders cellular respiration, and reduces the survival of GBM cells. Furthermore, selective MAT2a or AHCY inhibition reduces GBM cell viability, impairs oxidative metabolism, and changes the metabolic profile of these cells towards oxidative stress and cell death. Mechanistically, MAT2a or AHCY regulates spare respiratory capacity, the redox buffer cystathionine, lipid and amino acid metabolism, and prevents DNA damage in GBM cells. Our results point to the methionine metabolic pathway as a novel vulnerability point in GBM.

Path2Omics was trained on 20,497 slides (9,456 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and 11,041 fresh frozen (FF)) from 8,007 patients across 23 The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts.

Externally evaluated on seven independent cohorts, Path2Omics robustly predicted the expression of approximately 4,400 genes, yielding a 30% increase over the FFPE model alone. Finally, we demonstrate that the inferred gene expression is nearly as effective as the actual values in predicting patient survival and treatment response. These results lay the basis for using Path2Omics to advance precision oncology from histopathology slides in a speedy and cost-effective manner.

As macrophages can promote liver growth and contribute to resolution of chronic liver injury and fibrosis, we tested the hypothesis that stimulation of monocytes and macrophages with Colony Stimulating Factor 1 (CSF1) could have a beneficial impact on liver repair after I/R injury.

MethodsWe investigated the impact of perisurgical treatment with a long-circulating CSF1-Fc conjugate on liver injury and hepatocyte proliferation after 70% ischemia for 60 minutes at 6 h, 48 h and 7 days post reperfusion in male rats. Changes in the circulating and liver tissue monocyte and macrophage subsets in the ischaemic and oxygenated lobes were assessed using quantitative PCR and flow cytometry.

ResultsCSF1-Fc treatment did not affect the extent of hepatocellular injury post-reperfusion, as indicated by serum transaminases. Liver I/R injury, especially necrotic area, was reduced in CSF1-Fc-treated rats 48 h post-surgery. This was associated with increased accumulation of macrophages in both the oxygenated and ischemic lobes, and localization to necrotic tissue in the ischemic lobe. CSF1-Fc treatment also promoted liver growth, associated with increased parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell proliferation. Flow cytometry and gene expression analysis demonstrated increased monocyte infiltration in ischemic compared to oxygenated lobes. CSF1-Fc increased the abundance of CD43+ non-classical monocytes, consistent with the role of CSF1 signaling in monocyte maturation, and increased CD163 expression on mature macrophages.

ConclusionThis study suggests CSF1 stimulation drives monocytes/macrophages towards a pro-regenerative response and perisurgical CSF1 treatment might augment liver regeneration in patients undergoing liver resection.

While the resulting indices of risky choice and impulsivity correlate at the population level, dopaminergic manipulations rarely impact both behaviours uniformly, with changes in choice more likely when dopaminergic transmission is altered during task acquisition. Although the task structure of the rGT remains constant, the importance of accumbal dopamine signals relevant for reward prediction versus impulse control may vary over time; the former should dominate while learning which option maximises sugar pellet profits, while the suppression of premature responses becomes more valuable once a decision-making strategy is set and can be exploited. Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) critically control dopamine release within the striatum, and can also encode latent task states deciphered by the frontal cortex. We theorised that aCINs may set the dopaminergic tone of the accumbens to maximise reward learning or impulse control during task acquisition or performance, respectively. Using chemogenetics, we found some support for this hypothesis: activation and inhibition of aCINs once behaviour was stable increased and decreased motor impulsivity in both sexes but had no effect on choice patterns. In contrast, activating and inhibiting aCINs throughout task acquisition did not alter motor impulsivity, but decreased and increased risky choice respectively. However, the former effect was only seen in males and the latter in females. We conclude by proposing a set of testable predictions regarding interactions between acetylcholine and dopamine that could explain these sex differences.",NA,biorxiv

There is stronger verb activation beginning at [~]600 milliseconds at the critical adverb when it appears at a verb phrase boundary; this effect is not modulated by the strength of conceptual association between the two subcomponents in the verb phrase nor does it reflect word predictability. Time-locked analyses additionally reveal a negativity waveform component and increased beta-delta inter-trial phase coherence, both previously linked to linguistic composition, in a similar time window. With a novel application of neural decoding, our findings delineate the temporal dynamics by which the brain encodes phrasal representations by, in part, reactivating the representation of key subcomponents. We thus establish a link between cognitive accounts of phrase structure representations and electrophysiological dynamics.",NA,biorxiv

The structure of such pedigrees is challenging to visualise. Being directed acyclic graphs, pedigrees can be represented as matrices. Common choices are the numerator relationship matrix, A, and the adjacency matrix T. With these matrices, the structure of pedigrees can then, in principle, be visualised via principal component analysis (PCA). However, the naive PCA of matrices for large pedigrees is challenging due to computational and memory constraints.

ResultsWe present the open-access R package randPedPCA for rapid pedigree PCA using sparse matrices and randomised linear algebra. Our rapid pedigree PCA builds on the fact that matrix-vector multiplications with the numerator relationship matrix can be carried out implicitly using the extremely sparse inverse Cholesky factor of the numerator relationship matrix. We demonstrate the utility of randPedPCA using several simulated datasets of pedigrees and SNPs. We then demonstrate the performance of randPedPCA by analysing the pedigree of the UK Labrador Retriever breeding population of almost 1.5 million individuals.

ConclusionsThe structure of pedigrees can be efficiently and rapidly visualised using scatter plots of principal component scores. For large pedigrees, this is considerably faster than rendering plots of a pedigree graph.",NA,biorxiv

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of m6A reader proteins in the heart. However, the function of a reader protein Ythdf3 in the heart remains completely unknown.

ObjectiveWe aim to uncover the function of Ythdf3 in the hearts.

Methods& ResultsHere, we show that Ythdf3 is indispensable for the heart, and its knockdown leads to cardiac cachexia evident by cardiomyocyte atrophy, death, and less dense myofibrils visualized by electron microscopy. We also found downregulation of Ythdf3 in response to doxorubicin, and its overexpression rescues doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte atrophy and death. Contrary to primarily cytoplasmic localization, we found that Ythdf3 localizes in the cardiomyocyte nucleus. Furthermore, using co-immunoprecipitation coupled with LC-MS/MS, we show that Ythdf3 interacts with splicing proteins like DDX5 and HNRNPU and regulates alternative splicing in the heart. Mechanistically, we found that Ythdf3 regulates the splicing of CaMKII{delta}, and its knockdown leads to an increase in CaMKII{delta}A and CaMKII{delta}C isoforms while a decrease in CaMKII{delta}9 isoform.

ConclusionCollectively, Ythdf3 knockdown in the adult heart leads to cardiac cachexia due to the alteration of the splicing program.",NA,biorxiv

In recent years, an increase in human-to-human transmission has been observed, particularly during the 2022 outbreak caused by Clade IIb, which was declared a public health emergency by WHO. In 2024, the emergence of Clade Ib from Africa raised global concern once again. While several studies have provided valuable insights into the differences among MPXV clades, research on Clade Ib remains limited. In this study, we have conducted a comprehensive comparative genome sequence analysis and identified unique features across MPXV clade sequences. We report a [~]1141 bp long novel deletion resulting in loss of the complement control protein (CCP) in Clade Ib sequences, a deletion earlier exclusively reported in Clade II sequences. Additionally, B22R, a crucial host receptor-binding protein involved in viral entry and known for its high immunogenicity, shows clade-specific amino acid changes across three MPXV clades. Moreover, multiple extragenic mutations were identified in the 5 UTR of several genes, which may impact gene transcription. Other frequently mutated proteins are linked to immune evasion, translation, and viral entry and exit. The above results and APOBEC signatures associated with sustained human-to-human transmission highlight the viruss potential for rapid adaptation, underscoring the need for vigilance against reverse zoonosis and the risk of spillover to new hosts.",NA,biorxiv

While several gene-targeted therapeutic approaches have proven efficacious in vitro, these often target regions of the human gene that are not conserved in rodents, hindering the pre-clinical development of these compounds and their transition to the clinic. To overcome this limitation, here we generate and characterize Syngap1 and Stxbp1 humanized mouse models in which we replaced the mouse Syngap1 and Stxbp1 gene, respectively, with the human counterpart, including regulatory and non-coding regions. Fully humanized Syngap1 mice present normal viability, and they were successfully crossed with a currently available Syngap1 heterozygous knockout mouse model to generate Syngap1 humanized-haploinsufficient mice (Syngap1Hu/-). Fully humanized Stxbp1 mice exhibit impaired viability (particularly males) and reduced STXBP1 protein abundance, precluding the generation of an Stxbp1 humanized-haploinsufficient model. Alternatively, Stxbp1 hybrid mice express normal levels of STXBP1 and represent a useful model to evaluate target engagement of human-specific therapeutics. Syngap1Hu/- mice display haploinsufficient levels of human SYNGAP1 and recapitulate several SYNGAP1-related phenotypes, including hyperactivity, increased repetitive behaviors, and deficits in locomotor coordination and memory. We also show that human gene-targeted antisense oligonucleotides can effectively modulate human SYNGAP1 expression in the Syngap1Hu/- context.

However, up to 50% of leukemia patients relapse and long-term survivor data indicate that CART cell persistence is key to enforcing relapse-free survival. Unfortunately, ex vivo expansion protocols often drive metabolic and functional exhaustion, reducing in vivo efficacy. Preclinical models have demonstrated that redirecting metabolism ex vivo can improve in vivo T cell function and we hypothesized that exposure to an agonist targeting the metabolic regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), would create CARTs capable of both efficient leukemia clearance and increased in vivo persistence.

METHODSCART cells were generated from healthy human via lentiviral transduction. Following activation, cells were exposed to either Compound 991 or DMSO for 96 hours, followed by a 48-hour washout. During and after agonist treatment, T cells were harvested for metabolic and functional assessments. To test in vivo efficacy, immunodeficient mice were injected with luciferase+ NALM6 leukemia cells, followed one week later by either 991- or DMSO-expanded CARTs. Leukemia burden and anti-leukemia efficacy was assessed via radiance imaging and overall survival.

RESULTSHuman T cells expanded in Compound 991 activated AMPK without limiting cellular expansion and gained both mitochondrial density and improved handling of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, receipt of 991-exposed CARTs significantly improved in vivo leukemia clearance, prolonged recipient survival, and increased CD4+ T cell yields at early times post-injection. Ex vivo, 991 agonist treatment mimicked nutrient starvation, increased autophagic flux, and promoted generation of mitochondrially-protective metabolites.

DISCUSSIONEx vivo expansion processes are necessary to generate sufficient cell numbers, but often promote sustained activation and differentiation, negatively impacting in vivo persistence and function. Here, we demonstrate that promoting AMPK activity during CART expansion metabolically reprograms cells without limiting T cell yield, enhances in vivo anti-leukemia efficacy, and improves CD4+ in vivo persistence. Importantly, AMPK agonism achieves these results without further modifying the expansion media, changing the CART construct, or genetically altering the cells. Altogether, these data highlight AMPK agonism as a potent and readily translatable approach to improve the metabolic profile and overall efficacy of cancer-targeting T cells.",NA,biorxiv

Nevertheless, microbial functions and interactions driving these ecological processes remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyze oral microbiomes from a longitudinal cohort of 24 mother-infant dyads at 1 and 6 months postpartum using shotgun metagenomics. We identify two previously undescribed Streptococcus and Rothia species to be among the most prevalent, abundant and strongly co-occurring members of the oral microbiome of six-month-old infants. To explore the underlying genomic traits enabling this unique lifestyle, we leveraged metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and genome-scale metabolic models (GEMS). Comparative analyses revealed specific genomic and functional characteristics relative to other closely related species and highlighted unique functional features, including genes encoding adhesins and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). The observed co-occurrence patterns were further supported by predicted metabolic interactions within a network of co-occurring oral taxa. Metabolic modeling identified potential exchange of key nutrients, particularly malate and lysine, between these species, suggesting metabolic cross-feeding interactions that may explain their co-occurrence across infant oral microbiomes. Overall, this study provides key insights into the functional adaptations and microbial interactions shaping early colonization in the oral cavity.

Author SummaryWe investigated how infant oral bacterial communities develop during their first six months of life, with the aim to understand which microbes colonize, how they establish themselves and why they succeed together. Using high throughput DNA sequencing techniques, we analyzed oral samples from 24 mother-infant pairs at one and six months after birth.

We found two abundant, but previously unknown bacterial species (one Streptococcus and one Rothia) at six months of age. These bacteria consistently appear together across different babies, suggesting they may depend on each other for survival and growth.

By reconstructing the genomes of these bacteria directly from our samples, we discovered specific genetic features that help explain their success in the infant mouth. Streptococcus carries genes that allow it to break down nutrients from breast milk. Rothia has genes that help it rapidly build cell membranes and protect against harmful molecules, while producing nutrients that Streptococcus needs. We predict these bacteria exchange key nutrients like malate and lysine, creating a mutually beneficial partnership. The bacteria seem to cooperate and are predicted to exchange key nutrients like malate and lysine which may help maintain a healthy oral environment by regulating acidity levels, potentially protecting against tooth decay.",NA,biorxiv

Specifically, it focuses on a key characteristic of natural speech: the speech envelope. To achieve this, we employed two distinct measures. The first evaluates how effectively the patients brain activity ""tracks"" the speech envelope, called neural tracking. The second assesses the complexity of the brains responses to the speech stimulus, measured through spectral entropy. These two measures are then compared in their association with the patients clinical diagnosis and their level of behavioral responsiveness, both of which were assessed using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R).

DesignFour patients with DoC participated in this study, during which their brain activity was recorded using electroen-cephalography (EEG). At the same time, they listened to a narrated story in both Dutch and Swedish. Additionally, EEG baseline recordings were collected. We employed a backward modeling approach to evaluate the speech envelopes neural tracking. This technique involves training a model to map the relationship between EEG signals and the corresponding speech envelope. Once the model is trained, it can use unseen EEG data to reconstruct the speech envelope, which is then compared to the original speech envelope to assess how effectively the patient processed the auditory stimulus. For the behavioral assessment, we recalculated the CRS-R score of each patient into the CSR-R index, a more meaningful score that utilizes all the information contained in the CRS-R instead of only the highest scores on each subscale.

ResultsOur findings revealed positive correlations between spectral entropy and the CRS-R index, which were more pronounced during the listening conditions than the baseline. While neural tracking of the speech envelope did not correlate with the CRS-R index, it did exhibit a positive association with CRS-R diagnoses, indicating that patients with better clinical diagnoses demonstrated higher levels of neural tracking. Additionally, we identified an interaction effect between spectral entropy and neural tracking. Specifically, higher levels of neural tracking were associated with a stronger positive relationship between spectral entropy and the CRS-R index. In contrast, when neural tracking was lower, this relationship disappeared.

ConclusionThis study demonstrated the potential of neural tracking and spectral entropy as complementary tools to investigate patients with DoC. Spectral entropy proved valuable for assessing behavioral responsiveness, while neural tracking shows promise in assessing the DoC diagnosis.

Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated the key role of kinesin-1 in driving microtubule-microtubule sliding, which provides the mechanical forces necessary for early axon outgrowth and regeneration in Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we reveal the critical role of kinesin-5, a mitotic motor, in modulating the development of postmitotic neurons.

Kinesin-5, a conserved homotetrameric motor, typically functions in mitosis by sliding antiparallel microtubules apart in the spindle. Here, we demonstrate that the Drosophila kinesin-5 homolog, Klp61F, is expressed in larval brain neurons, with high levels in ventral nerve cord (VNC) neurons. Knockdown of Klp61F using a pan-neuronal driver leads to severe locomotion defects and complete lethality in adult flies, mainly due to the absence of kinesin-5 in VNC motor neurons during early larval development. Klp61F depletion results in significant axon growth defects, both in cultured and in vivo neurons. By imaging individual microtubules, we observe a significant increase in microtubule motility, and excessive penetration of microtubules into the axon growth cone in Klp61F-depleted neurons. Adult lethality and axon growth defects are fully rescued by a chimeric human-Drosophila kinesin-5 motor, which accumulates at the axon tips, suggesting a conserved role of kinesin-5 in neuronal development.

Altogether, our findings show that at the growth cone, kinesin-5 acts as a brake on kinesin-1-driven microtubule sliding, preventing premature microtubule entry into the growth cone. This regulatory role of kinesin-5 is essential for precise axon pathfinding during nervous system development.",NA,biorxiv

The prevalence of facultative endosymbionts can fluctuate in host populations across time and geography for reasons that are poorly understood. This is particularly true for maternally transmitted Wolbachia bacteria, which infect roughly half of all insect species. For instance, the frequencies of several wMel-like Wolbachia, including wMel in host Drosophila melanogaster, fluctuate over time in certain host populations, but the specific conditions that generate temporal variation in Wolbachia prevalence are unresolved. We implemented a discrete generation model in the new R package symbiontmodeler to evaluate how finite-population stochasticity contributes to Wolbachia fluctuations over time in simulated host populations under a variety of conditions. Using empirical estimates from natural Wolbachia-Drosophila systems, we explored how stochasticity is determined by a broad range of factors, including host population size, maternal transmission rates, and Wolbachia effects on host fitness (modeled as fecundity) and reproduction (cytoplasmic incompatibility; CI). While stochasticity generally increases when host fitness benefits and CI are relaxed, we found that a decline in the maternal transmission rate had the strongest relative impact on increasing the size of fluctuations. We infer that non- or weak-CI-causing strains like wMel, which often show evidence of imperfect maternal transmission, tend to generate larger stochastic fluctuations compared to strains that cause strong CI, like wRi in D. simulans. Additional factors, such as fluctuating host fitness effects, are required to explain the largest examples of temporal variation in Wolbachia. The conditions we simulate here using symbiontmodeler serve as a jumping off point for understanding drivers of temporal and spatial variation in the prevalence of Wolbachia, the most common endosymbionts found in nature.",NA,biorxiv

Regulation of cell death is mostly orchestrated by the activation of Caspases, proteases which were long thought to trigger an irreversible engagement in cell death. However, recent data in vivo and in vitro outline numerous non-apoptotic functions of caspases as well as quite ubiquitous sublethal activation of effector caspases during development. Yet, it remains unclear in many instances what drives the bifurcation between cell death engagement and cell survival upon caspase activation. The existence of a caspase activity threshold was generally considered to underpin this binary decision, but this was never assessed quantitatively in vivo especially at the single cell level. Using quantitative live imaging combined with machine learning and optogenetics in the Drosophila pupal notum (a single layer epithelium), we reveal for the first time the existence of a large heterogeneity of caspase sensitivity between cells, as well as the existence of distinct spatial domains with low or high sensitivity to caspases. Using correlative and perturbative experiments, we outline the central role of past exposure to sublethal caspase activity which sensitises cells for apoptosis for several hours. Integrating information about past caspase activation is sufficient to explain most of the global pattern of caspase sensitivity and predict at the single cell level which cells will engage in apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrate that past sublethal caspase activation in a subset of cells is sufficient to bias cell elimination at the clonal and single cell level, thus revealing an alternative mechanism of physiological cell competition. Altogether, this work reveals for the first time the existence of a new layer of apoptosis regulation in vivo downstream of effector caspases which can be developmentally regulated and bias clonal selection and the spatial pattern of cell death.",NA,biorxiv

Thus, the goal of this study was to establish a novel microfluidic-based platform for the analysis of RGC compartmentalization in health and disease states. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived RGCs were seeded into microfluidics, enabling the recruitment and isolation of axons apart from the somatodendritic compartment. Initial studies explored axonal outgrowth and compartmentalization of axons and dendrites. We then compared the differential response of RGCs differentiated from hPSCs carrying the OPTN(E50K) glaucoma mutation with isogenic control RGCs in their respective axonal and somatodendritic compartments, followed by analysis of axonal transport. Further, we explored the axonal transcriptome via RNA-seq, focusing on disease-related axonal differences. Finally, we established models to uniquely orient astrocytes along the axonal compartment combined with modulation of astrocyte reactivity as a pathological feature of neurodegeneration. Overall, RGC culture within microfluidic chips allowed enhanced cell growth and maturation, including long-distance axonal projections and proper compartmentalization, while patient-specific RGCs exhibited axonal outgrowth deficits as well as decreased rate of axonal transport.

During a blinded review of structural MRIs, a neuroradiologists categorization of case-control status did not correspond to disease status (Fishers test, P>0.99) but rather to age (P=0.004), indicating qualitative changes associated with Fabry were similar to normal age-related brain alterations. Using quantitative MRI, however, we detected evidence of microstructural damage in the white matter of younger Fabry adults (<40 yrs). With age, WML severity increased and the corpus callosum atrophied in Fabry, phenomena absent in controls and consistent with progressive tissue damage. Neurocognitive assessments identified trends for lower verbal intelligence quotient and executive function in the younger Fabry participants, which became statistically significant in the older Fabry cohort. Our data indicate that the early onset of microstructural damage in Fabry drives the insidious degeneration of white matter, leading to reduced cognition. Aging Fabry patients may benefit from serial cognitive assessments to identify unmet therapeutic needs.",NA,biorxiv

Among the honey bee species, the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) is particularly significant, not only for its extensive crop pollination services but also for producing economically valuable products such as honey. Here, we analyzed whole-genome sequence data from four Apis species to explore how honey bee evolution has shaped current diversity patterns. Using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we first reconstructed the demographic history of A. mellifera in Europe, finding support for postglacial secondary contacts, therefore predating human-mediated transfers linked to modern beekeeping. However, our analysis of recent demographic changes then reveals significant bottlenecks due to beekeeping practices, which have notably affected genetic diversity. Black honey bee populations from conservatories, particularly those on islands, exhibit considerable genetic loss, raising concerns about the long-term effectiveness of current conservation strategies. Additionally, we observed a high degree of conservation in the genomic landscapes of nucleotide diversity across the four species, despite a divergence gradient spanning over 15 million years, consistent with a long-term conservation of the recombination landscapes. Taken together, our results provide the most comprehensive assessment of diversity patterns in honey bees to date and offer insights into the optimal management of resources to ensure the long-term persistence of honey bees and their invaluable pollination services.",NA,biorxiv

In this study, we demonstrated that when senataxin (SETX), an RNA/DNA helicase, is defective, hyperrecombination using the BIR mechanism is induced at R-loops/hybrids-accumulated double-ended DNA double strand breaks (deDSBs), suggesting a potential role of BIR in repair of R-loops/hybrids-associated deDSBs. Intriguingly, while loss of SETX initiates a non-canonical hyper end resection pathway requiring RAD52 and XPF, it also causes collisions of DNA repair synthesis with R-loops/hybrids, leading to ubiquitination of PCNA and recruitment of PIF1 to establish BIR at R-loops/hybrids-associated deDSBs. Strikingly, SETX-deficiency does not only induce hyper BIR but also leads to a drastic increase in template switching during BIR, uncovering an important mechanism causing genome instability through replicative chromosomal rearrangements due to SETX deficiency. Furthermore, SETX is synthetic lethal with PIF1, RAD52 and XPF. Collectively, our study sheds light on how R- loops/hybrids influence the utilization and fidelity of DSB repair pathways and offers new strategies for targeted treatment of SETX-deficient tumors.

Significance statementR-loops are widespread, occupying 5-10 % of the human genome, and thus understanding the DSB repair mechanisms associated with R-loops is of great importance. Defect in senataxin (SETX), an RNA-DNA helicase, is associated with neurodegenerative disorders and tumorigenesis. Our study reveals that R-loop accumulation at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) due to SETX deficiency triggers hyperrecombination through break-induced replication (BIR), accompanied by a drastic increase in template switching during BIR. This uncovers a significant source of replication-associated complex genome rearrangements (CGRs) linked to prevalent R-loops, providing new insights into cancer-associated genome instability. Furthermore, this work not only uncovers the repair mechanisms utilized at DSBs in the context of dynamic R-loop formation, but also opens new therapeutic opportunities for targeting SETX-deficient tumors.",NA,biorxiv

Using single cell RNAseq and flow cytometry we identified many immune cell populations in the near-term fetus (at embryologic day 22) and neonatal (postnatal day 1, 7, &14) islets, non-endocrine pancreas, and the spleen in the rat. Using flow cytometry, we observed the resident immune system is established during neonatal development in the pancreas and spleen. We identified 9 distinct immune populations in the pancreatic islets and 8 distinct immune populations in the spleen by single cell RNAseq. There were no sex-specific differences in the relative proportion of immune cells in the pancreas or spleen. Finally, we tested if IUGR disrupted the neonatal immune system using bilateral uterine artery ligation. We found significant changes to the percentage of CD11B+ HIS48- and CD8+ T cells in the islets and non-endocrine pancreas and in the spleen.

The bowhead is also the second-largest animal on Earth, reaching over 80,000 kg1. Despite its very large number of cells and long lifespan, the bowhead is not highly cancer-prone, an incongruity termed Petos Paradox2. This phenomenon has been explained by the evolution of additional tumor suppressor genes in other larger animals, supported by research on elephants demonstrating expansion of the p53 gene3-5. Here we show that bowhead whale fibroblasts undergo oncogenic transformation after disruption of fewer tumor suppressors than required for human fibroblasts. However, analysis of DNA repair revealed that bowhead cells repair double strand breaks (DSBs) and mismatches with uniquely high efficiency and accuracy compared to other mammals. The protein CIRBP, implicated in protection from genotoxic stress, was present in very high abundance in the bowhead whale relative to other mammals. We show that CIRBP and its downstream protein RPA2, also present at high levels in bowhead cells, increase the efficiency and fidelity of DNA repair in human cells. These results indicate that rather than possessing additional tumor suppressor genes as barriers to oncogenesis, the bowhead whale relies on more accurate and efficient DNA repair to preserve genome integrity. This strategy which does not eliminate damaged cells but repairs them may be critical for the long and cancer-free lifespan of the bowhead whale.",NA,biorxiv

This expansion correlated with faster reaction times and reinstatement of the target association. Crucially, hippocampal theta and cortical gamma phase-amplitude coupling emerged after ripples but before cortical expansion, suggesting a mechanism for ripple-driven communication. Ripple events also marked the separation of task-relevant variables in cortical state space, revealing how hippocampal output reshapes the geometry of memory representations to support successful recall.",NA,biorxiv

However, while theoretically intriguing, direct empirical support for the effect of niche construction on adaptation is lacking. Red flour beetles modify their environment by releasing quinone-rich stink gland secretions, a form of external immunity. Here, we test in an evolution experiment how experimental removal of niche construction--using RNAi of a key gene needed to produce stink gland secretions--affects the beetles adaptation to the bacterial entomopathogen Bacillus thuringiensis. In each generation, beetles inhabited conditioned flour either with regular or drastically reduced stink gland secretion content. Compared to the non-exposed control, all bacteria-exposed regimes rapidly evolved bacterial resistance within only six generations. However, beetles evolving with intact niche construction acquired resistance as soon as after three generations, indicating that adaptation was initially facilitated by niche construction. RNAseq of evolved beetles showed that gene expression differed strongly between the selection regimes, revealing that the mechanisms underlying resistance were dependent on niche construction. Thus, our findings provide urgently needed empirical evidence on the role of niche construction for resistance evolution and its potential genetic basis.",NA,biorxiv

To ensure consistency, we tested three normalization methods--log normalization, canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and SCTransform--for scRNA-seq data integration and preprocessing, which facilitated reliable predictions of immune cell distributions in bulk RNA-seq.

By applying this scRNA-seq-informed cell composition deconvolution model to real bulk RNA-seq data from liver cancer samples, we confirmed alignment in immune cell composition estimates between bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq.

Here, we test post-catastrophic climate impacts on barley, maize, rice, and sorghum, four crops with extensive landrace cultivation, under a range of nuclear war scenarios that differ in the amount of black carbon aerosol (soot) injected into the climate model. We used a crop growth model to estimate gradients of environmental stressors that drive local adaptation. We then fit genotype environment associations using high density genomic markers with gradient forest offset (GF offset) methods and predicted maladaptation through time. As a validation, we found that our GF models successfully predicted local adaptation of maize landraces in multiple common gardens across Mexico. We found strong concordance between GF offset and disruptions in climate, and landraces of all tested crop species were predicted to be the most maladapted across space and time where soot-induced climate change was the greatest. We further used our GF models to identify landrace varieties best matched to specific post-catastrophic conditions, indicating potential substitutions for agricultural resilience. We found the best landrace genotype was often far away or in another nation, though countries with more climatic diversity had better within-country substitutions.

Mutations in TP53 and SMAD4, in particular, are associated with poor treatment response and enhanced CRC pathogenesis. Although gut microbiome dysbiosis is implicated in CRC initiation and inflammation, the interactions between the microbiome and specific CRC driver mutations, especially those promoting metastasis, are poorly defined. In this study, we used triple mutant (Apc, Kras, Tp53; AKP) and quadruple mutant (Apc, Kras, Tp53, Smad4; AKPS) organoid-based orthotopic mouse models of CRC to examine the impact of SMAD4 mutation on tumor progression, metastasis, and microbiome composition. AKP and AKPS organoids were endoscopically implanted into the colons of individually housed C57BL/6 mice, and fecal samples were collected weekly over an 8-week period. Our results reveal significant differences in metastatic potential and microbial community dynamics between the two tumor models. AKPS tumors exhibited metastasis to the lymph nodes, liver, and lungs, whereas AKP tumors remained confined to the colon. Longitudinal microbiome analysis showed shifts in microbial composition within each tumor model. Both AKP and AKPS models demonstrated enrichment of Faecalibaculum and a decrease in Dubosiella over time; however, additional shifts were observed with distinct taxa associated with late-stage tumors in each group. Notably, the AKPS model exhibited higher relative abundances of pro-inflammatory taxa, including Turicibacter, Romboutsia, and Akkermansia, suggesting that SMAD4 mutation promotes a more immunosuppressive and pro-metastatic microbiome profile. These findings underscore the role of SMAD4 in modulating the microbiome in a manner that favors CRC metastasis and suggests potential microbial targets for therapeutic intervention to slow CRC progression.

Using DMS-TRAM-seq, we generated secondary structure predictions for over 9,000 human transcripts, including hundreds of non-coding RNAs, and identified more than 700 previously unannotated, high-confidence structured elements. Importantly, the enhanced coverage provided by DMS-TRAM-seq enabled comparative analyses, revealing RNAs that undergo structural rearrangements in response to cellular perturbations. Integration with RBP motifs and ribosome profiling uncovered altered RNA-RBP interactions during oxidative stress and showed that translation inhibition broadly drives RNAs toward their thermodynamically favored conformations. DMS-TRAM-seq enables interrogation of the RNA structurome and its plasticity at an unprecedented scale, opening new directions for elucidating the structural basis of RNA regulation.",NA,biorxiv

This criticality has led to the development of computational approaches for the prediction of LBCEs, aiming at accelerating discovery and prioritising targets for experimental assessment. Existing LBCE predictors rely on having access to large volumes of data from a wide range of pathogens for training predictive models, which can result in biases towards widely studied organisms and compromise performance when focusing on neglected or emerging pathogens. We introduce a phylogeny-aware transfer learning strategy that results in noticeable gains in expected predictive performance. This is achieved by fine tuning large protein language models using abundant data from higher-level taxa and applying this refined feature embedder for fitting pathogen- or lower taxon-specific models. We report substantially increased performance in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches for LBCE prediction, and show that these gains can be directly attributed to the use of phylogeny-aware fine tuning of the feature embedder coupled with pathogen- or taxon-optimized modelling.",NA,biorxiv

ZAP interacts with several cofactors to form the ZAP antiviral system, including KHNYN, a multidomain endoribonuclease required for ZAP-mediated RNA decay. However, it is unclear how the individual domains in KHNYN contribute to its activity. Here, we demonstrate that the KHNYN amino terminal extended-diKH (ex-diKH) domain is required for antiviral activity and present its crystal structure. The structure belongs to a rare group of KH-containing domains, characterized by a non-canonical arrangement between two type-1 KH modules, with an additional helical bundle. N4BP1 is a KHNYN paralog with an ex-diKH domain that functionally complements the KHNYN ex-diKH domain. Interestingly, the ex-diKH domain structure is present in N4BP1-like proteins in lancelets, which are basal chordates, indicating that it is evolutionarily ancient. While many KH domains demonstrate RNA binding activity, biolayer interferometry and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that the KHNYN ex-diKH domain does not bind RNA. Furthermore, residues required for canonical KH domains to bind RNA are not required for KHNYN antiviral activity. By contrast, an inter-KH domain cleft in KHNYN is a potential protein-protein interaction site and mutations that eliminate arginine salt bridges at the edge of this cleft decrease KHNYN antiviral activity. This suggests that this domain could be a binding site for an unknown KHNYN cofactor.",NA,biorxiv

A key question is whether such a mechanism is sufficient to form highly branched dendritic morphologies. Alternatively, are signals from other cells or is the topological hierarchy of the growing network necessary for dendrite geometry? To answer these questions, we developed a mean-field model in which branch dynamics is isotropic and homogenous (i.e., no extrinsic instruction) and depends only on the average lengths and densities of branches. Branching is modeled as density-dependent nucleation so there are no tree structures and no network topology. Despite its simplicity, the model predicted several key morphological properties of class IV Drosophila sensory dendrites, including the exponential distribution of branch lengths, the parabolic scaling between dendrite number and length densities, the tight spacing of the dendritic meshwork (which required minimal total branch length), and the radial orientation of branches. Stochastic growth also accelerated the overall expansion rate of the arbor. Therefore, stochastic dynamics is an economical and rapid space-filling mechanism for building dendritic arbors without external guidance or hierarchical branching mechanisms. Our model provides a general theoretical framework for understanding how macroscopic branching patterns emerge from microscopic dynamics.",NA,biorxiv

Generalist parasites are subject to highly variable selection pressures across different hosts and the footprints that this heterogeneous selection leaves in the genomes of generalists have been largely unexplored. To address this knowledge gap, we studied patterns of host-associated genetic diversity in the generalist plant parasite, the northern root knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla. By leveraging whole genome amplification, we generated whole genome libraries of individual root-knot nematodes collected from three different host plant species in a spatially replicated design. Despite finding no evidence of host-associated population structure, we did observe several hundred host-associated SNPs putatively under differential host selection. Genomic regions containing these host-associated SNPs were enriched for signals of balancing selection. Additionally, host-associated SNPs were enriched for functions involved in plant pathogenesis, specifically the modification of plant cell walls. Host-associated SNPs were also found in genes with known roles in dampening host plant immune responses to infection. Together, our results suggest a model of balancing selection in which heterogeneous selection by different host taxa maintains adaptive diversity at loci involved in pathogenesis.",NA,biorxiv

The molecular mechanisms underlying nucleophagy remain inadequately understood. In this study, we identify a nucleophagy receptor, Npr1, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Npr1 is an Atg8-binding multi-transmembrane protein localized to the outer nuclear membrane. It functions redundantly with another autophagy receptor Epr1 to promote nitrogen starvation-induced nucleophagy. In the absence of both Npr1 and Epr1, starved cells exhibit abnormal nuclear morphology and reduced survival. During nucleophagy, the nuclear envelope (NE) forms outward protrusions where Atg8 co-localizes with Npr1 and/or Epr1. These protrusions subsequently detach from the NE, resulting in the formation of autophagosomes that contain nucleophagy cargo. Notably, artificially enhancing chromatin association with the inner nuclear membrane leads to NE protrusions that fail to detach, thereby aborting nucleophagy. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into nucleophagy and suggest that abortive nucleophagy protects chromatin from degradation.",NA,biorxiv

Drawing inspiration from quantum molecular simulations, we introduce ECloudGen, a generative model that leverages electron clouds as meaningful latent variables--an innovative integration of physical principles into deep learning frameworks. ECloudGen incorporates modern techniques, including latent diffusion models, Llama architectures, and a newly proposed contrastive learning task, which organizes the chemical space into a structured and highly interpretable latent representation. Benchmark studies demonstrate that ECloudGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating more potent binders with superior physiochemical properties and by covering a significantly broader chemical space. The incorporation of electron clouds as latent variables not only improves generative performance but also introduces model-level interpretability, as illustrated in a case study designing V2R inhibitors. Furthermore, ECloudGens structurally ordered modeling of chemical space enables the development of a model-agnostic optimizer, extending its utility to molecular optimization tasks. This capability has been validated through a single-objective oracle benchmark and a complex multi-objective optimization scenario involving the redesign of endogenous BRD4 ligands. In conclusion, ECloudGen effectively addresses the Paradox of Sparse Chemical Space Generation through its integration of theoretical insights, advanced generative techniques, and real-world validation.

We therefore hypothesized that preemptive immunomodulation could decrease susceptibility and/or offer protection to pain.

Materials and MethodsSix days before the spared nerve injury (SNI), Wistar Han rats were treated with either the immunomodulator minocycline (MIN) or vehicle (VEH). After that, half of the animals from each group switch treatments for additional 7 days, resulting in 4 groups: continuous treatment (MIN/MIN), pretreatment (MIN/VEH), early treatment (VEH/MIN) and the control (VEH/VEH). Mechanical allodynia was recorded using Von Frey test until 4 weeks after SNI where depressive-like behaviors of the animals were also assessed using sucrose preference test.

ResultsThe continuous treatment provided sustained protection against mechanical allodynia, with rats in this group showing a significantly higher threshold to pain sensitivity compared to those in VEH/VEH. In contrast, pain relief effects were not observed with MIN/VEH and VEH/MIN. Additionally, animals in MIN/MIN, and VEH/MIN exhibited decreased anhedonic-like behavior at 30 days after SNI, relative to the control.

ConclusionsThe exposure to an anti-inflammatory drug circa the installation of a neuropathic lesion had a positive impact on allodynia and on anhedonic behavior for a relatively long period after treatment cessation. The results support the assertions that pain trajectories can be altered at pain early stages by targeting the neuroimmune system. This proof-of-concept has the potential to be broadened to other drugs and/or therapeutical schemes.

HighlightsChronic pain susceptibility varies across individuals.

Accordingly, Yap1 loss led to enhanced differentiation of the epiblast toward primitive streak lineages, as evidenced by the upregulation of T/Brachyury and Eomes genes. Furthermore, a proximity labeling assay in human pluripotent stem cells, followed by biochemical assays and molecular modeling predictions, revealed that YAP1 cooperates with QSER1 protein to regulate lineage genes. Our analysis shows that YAP1:TEAD4 enhancers recruit QSER1 to prevent RNA Polymerase II recruitment. Accordingly, QSER1 depletion, similar to YAP1, increases NODAL gene expression and leads to hyperactive NODAL signaling in human 2D-gastruloids.

To analyze the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics of neural signaling, we developed Geometric Scattering Trajectory Homology (neuro-GSTH), a novel framework that captures time-evolving neural signals and encodes them into low-dimensional representations. GSTH integrates geometric scattering transforms, which extract multiscale features from brain signals modeled on anatomical graphs, with t-PHATE, a manifold learning method that maps the temporal evolution of neural activity. Topological descriptors from computational homology are then applied to characterize the global structure of these neural trajectories, enabling the quantification and differentiation of spatiotemporal brain dynamics.

We demonstrate the power of neuro-GSTH in neuroscience by applying it to both simulated and biological neural datasets. First, we used neuro-GSTH to analyze neural oscillatory behavior in the Kuramoto model, revealing its capacity to track the synchronization of neural circuits as coupling strength increases. Next, we applied neuro-GSTH to neural recordings from the visual cortex of mice, where it accurately reconstructed visual stimulus patterns such as sinusoidal gratings. Neuro-GSTH-derived neural trajectories enabled precise classification of stimulus properties like spatial frequency and orientation, significantly outperforming traditional methods in capturing the underlying neural dynamics. These findings demonstrate that neuro-GSTH effectively identifies neural motifs--distinct patterns of spatiotemporal activity--providing a powerful tool for decoding brain activity across diverse tasks, sensory inputs, and neurological disorders.

Advances in lineage tracing technologies enable the reconstruction of high-resolution, single-cell phylogenies of cancer cell populations, but methods to detect cellular growth rate differences on these phylogenies remain limited. Tree balance statistics offer a way forward, but it is unknown if and how these statistics are distorted when applied to phylogenetic reconstructions built from lineage tracing data, and if these distortions limit the utility of tree balance statistics to distinguish between evolutionary scenarios characterized by variable or homogeneous cellular growth rates. Here, we examined two tree balance statistics, J1 and the Sackin index, and benchmarked their performance in distinguishing lineage tracing trees derived from populations with and without variable cellular growth rates. We found that when tumor population sizes and lineage tracing editing rates are approximately known and in favorable ranges, J1 detects departures from homogenous growth rates just as well on lineage tracing trees as on true genealogical trees, while the Sackin index loses most of its power even under the most favorable conditions. We applied our J1-based test to data derived from cancer lineage tracing experiments and found widespread signals of growth rate heterogeneity in murine autochthonous lung cancers, and lung and PDAC xenograft experiments in mice. Our results demonstrate the potential and challenges of tree balance statistics in analyzing growth dynamics in lineage tracing data.

Significance statementAlthough tree balance statistics are increasingly applied to examine tumor growth dynamics in trees built from bulk sequencing data, their application in tumor lineage tracing studies remains limited. In this study, we benchmarked J1 and the Sackin indexs potential to distinguish between tumor populations with and without varying growth rates among concurrent lineages using trees reconstructed from lineage tracing experiments. We describe conditions under which J1 can detect deviations from homogenous growth rates in lineage tracing trees, and find that the Sackin index is not well-suited to this objective.

Recently, combining cryoET with subtomogram averaging has pushed the resolution to 3-4 [A]. However, one main challenge for cryoET is locating target proteins in live cells. Conventional methods such as fluorescent protein tagging and immunogold labeling are not entirely suitable to label small structures in live cells with molecular resolution in vitrified samples. If large proteins, which can be visually identified in cryoET, are directly linked to the target protein, the large tag may alter the target protein structure, localization and function. To address this challenge, we used the rapamycin-induced oligomer formation system, which involves two tags (FKBP and FRB) that can bind together within rapamycin. In our system, the FKBP tag is linked to target protein and the FRB tag is linked to a large protein to create a marker. We chose ferritin as the marker protein because it is a large complex (10-12 nm) and can bind iron to create strong contrast in cryoET. After adding rapamycin to the cell medium, the iron-loaded ferritin accurately indicates the location of the target protein.

The causal mechanisms through which immune activation can drive depressive symptoms remain elusive, limiting the ability to develop new targeted therapies. Using a mouse model of neuroinflammation, involving a TLR7/8 agonist, we found central and systemic inflammation alongside anhedonia-like behaviours, altered thalamostriatal signalling and infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain. Here, we sought to use combined whole-brain transcriptome and spatial transcriptomics approaches to determine whether Aldara-driven neuroinflammation resulted in consistent immune and neurobiological changes throughout the brain. We found evidence of strong immune activation throughout the brain, with astrocytes displaying a strong inflammatory profile that was relatively uniform throughout. However, we found that this global inflammatory signal led to regionally-specific changes in gene expression, particularly reduced expression of genes associated with synaptic function in brain areas underlying mood and anxiety, such as ventral striatum and amygdala. Our data suggest potential mechanisms through which astrocytes regulate neuronal function in response to inflammation.",NA,biorxiv

It is, however, well-known that TEs can also be active in the soma, although the high-confidence detection of somatic events has been challenging. Here, we leveraged the high accuracy of PacBio HiFi long reads to evaluate the somatic mobility of TEs in individuals of an A. thaliana non-reference strain lacking activity of METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1), a major component of the DNA methylation maintenance machinery. Most somatically mobile families coincided with those found in germline studies of hypomethylated genotypes, although the exact TE copies differed. We also discovered mobile elements that had been missed by standard TE annotation methods. Somatic TE activity was variable among individual plants, but also within TE families. Finally, our approach pointed to the possible involvement of alternative transposition as a cause for somatic hypermutability in a region that contains two closely spaced VANDAL21 elements. We conclude that long-read sequencing can reveal widespread TE transposition in the soma of A. thaliana hypomethylated mutants. Assessing somatic instead of germline mobilization is a fast and reliable method to investigate different aspects of TE mobility at the single plant level.",NA,biorxiv

This study examines the activation behavior of the primary pulvinus (P1) in response to repeated touch stimuli, providing evidence for a mechanical exhaustion mechanism underlying the response. Experiments were conducted on M. pudica in Cuajiniquil, Costa Rica. Petiole angle change was recorded following repeated P1 stimuli, both with (P3 group) and without (NS-P3 group) concurrent tertiary pulvinus (P3) activation. Results showed the highest mean petiole angle change and P1 activations at the first stimulus, with a significant decline at the second stimulus and sustained lower responses thereafter. Both the NS-P3 and P3 groups exhibited similar overall behavior, characterized by a sharp decline in petiole angle change and P1 activation counts after the first stimulus. However, the P3 group had a lower initial petiole angle change compared to the NS-P3 group, and exhibited significant wave-like behavior, suggesting a more pronounced refractory period due to the combined activation of both P1 and P3 pulvini. The findings support a mechanical exhaustion explanation for the primary pulvinus behavior over repeated stimuli, where the rapid decline and sustained low responses suggest energy depletion and slow ion channel reset.",NA,biorxiv

However, few protocols exist for the preservation of brain organoid models. Current methods for preserving human cortical organoids (hCOs) rely on conventional slow cooling approaches with organoids suspended in a medium containing a cocktail of cryoprotectants. In contrast, we have optimized a vitrification technique previously used to cryopreserve human embryos and oocytes for application to hCOs. We have successfully cryopreserved hCOs that were generated by two different protocols. The vitrified organoids demonstrate a growth rate, cytoarchitecture, cell type composition and electrical activity comparable to non-vitrified controls. Our hCO cryopreservation method provides a useful alternative approach for bio-banking and cross-institutional collaboration using cortical organoids as their model system.

Highlights- Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) derived hCOs can be cryopreserved using vitrification.
- Vitrified hCOs develop similarly to non-vitrified controls.
- Vitrified hCOs can be stored long-term and shipped to other institutions.


MotivationMany methods of cryopreservation have been developed for the maintenance of cell lines, organoid models and tissues. Most organoid models have been successfully preserved using conventional slow-cooling methods; however, human cortical organoids have been difficult to preserve.

This visual stability is paralleled by the curious case of afterimage movement across saccades: Although retinotopically stable, afterimages appear to move in egocentric space wherever the eye moves. Even though this phenomenon has been known for centuries and could provide unique insights into visual stability, the mechanisms that give rise to afterimage movement remain unclear. By means of custom-built presentation hardware in complete darkness, observers viewed a bright foveal inducer pulse during fixation, executed a saccade to a previously cued location, and performed spatial localization of the emerging afterimage with respect to briefly flashed probes. This psychophysical tracking of afterimages was accompanied by eye tracking, allowing us to estimate afterimage-movement gain by fitting a dedicated computational model that simulated human localization responses. The extent of afterimage movement was accurately predicted by the size of eye movements with remarkably stable but significantly hypometric gains. Gains were unaffected by (even false) post-saccadic visual feedback and remained constant when saccade amplitudes were successfully adapted to lower gains. Irrespective of saccadic adaptation, afterimage-movement gains were inversely related to saccade gain - a finding that could be explained by a parsimonious efference-based model of head-centered visual localization. Our results suggest that afterimage movement across saccades is driven by feedforward prediction of the visual consequences of impending saccades and demonstrate the potential of the afterimage tracking technique for studying sensorimotor processes involved in active vision.

SignificanceIn low-light environments, brief high-intensity visual stimulation can induce long-lasting retinal afterimages. When observers then make eye movements to explore their visual environment, these afterimages - albeit fixed in the retinotopic frame of reference - appear to move in egocentric space wherever the eye moves. Even though this phenomenon has been known for centuries, the underlying computations remained unexplained. Tracking eye and afterimage positions simultaneously, we found that perceived afterimage position was accurately predicted by eye position across a variety of visuomotor conditions, whereby the eye movements size was however systematically underestimated by the visual system. Considering a parsimonious model of visual localization, after-image movement can be understood as a consequence of feedforward predictions of the visual consequences of impending eye movements.",NA,biorxiv

In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework that embeds molecules into a high-dimensional vector space, which we have named Deep Kernel Inversion. In this framework, the dot product between vectors accurately predicts molecular interactions. This approach reduces the complexity of predicting an entire molecular interaction network from O(n2) to O(n), enabling new molecular design tasks previously inaccessible to computational approaches.

In this study, we demonstrate that Caenorhabditis elegans male spermatogenesis has less robust mechanisms than hermaphrodite oogenesis for ensuring and limiting the conversion of double strand breaks into crossovers. This is not a consequence of differences in meiotic prophase timing, sex chromosome genotype, or the presence or absence of germline apoptosis. Using the cyclin-like crossover marker COSA-1, we show that males have a linear response in converting increasing numbers of double strand breaks into crossovers, suggesting weakened crossover homeostasis. While the topoisomerase SPO-11, responsible for initiating meiotic double strand breaks, has an extended period of activity in males as in hermaphrodites, we discovered that COSA-1 foci form at the very end of meiotic prophase in the absence of SPO-11 during spermatogenesis. These COSA-1-marked sites are also independent of homologous recombination, and Topoisomerases I and II. We find that the synaptonemal complex, which holds homologs in proximity, differently modulates COSA-1 enrichment to chromosomes in the absence of SPO-11 in males and hermaphrodites. Together, these findings suggest that males have less robust crossover control and that there are previously unrecognized lesions or structures at the end of meiotic prophase in spermatocytes that can accumulate CO markers.

Author SummaryFormation of healthy gametes depends on the accurate partitioning of genetic material in the daughter cells through meiosis. A hallmark of meiosis is the establishment of crossovers, which arise from physical exchange of DNA between the parental chromosomes during homologous recombination. Recombination is initiated via the induction of physiological DNA damage by the topoisomerase SPO-11 and its auxiliary factors. Abrogating SPO-11 activity prevents crossover formation, resulting in random chromosome segregation and generation of aneuploid gametes. While the underlying mechanisms of crossover formation are conserved between the sexes, several pieces of evidence indicate extensive sexual dimorphism. In our work we describe novel features of C. elegans spermatogenesis that reveal significant differences in the regulation of recombination compared to oogenesis. We find that in spermatogenesis crossover-promoting proteins can be recruited to chromosomes even in the absence of SPO-11 activity, a phenomenon not observed in the oogenic hermaphrodite germ line. Furthermore, removal of some auxiliary factors required for physiological break formation during oogenesis does not prevent crossover designation in spermatocytes. We show that the synaptonemal complex, tasked with keeping homologous chromosomes in proximity, exerts opposing roles in males and hermaphrodites by promoting and limiting the recruitment of SPO-11-independent crossover factors, respectively.",NA,biorxiv

During particle maturation, the HIV-1 protease cleaves the Gag polyproteins comprising the immature Gag lattice, releasing IP6 from its original binding site and liberating the capsid (CA) domain of Gag. IP6 then promotes the assembly of mature CA protein into the capsid shell of the viral core, which is required for infection of new target cells. Recently, we reported HIV-1 Gag mutants that assemble virions independently of IP6. However, these mutants are non-infectious and unable to assemble stable capsids. Here, we identified a mutation in the C-terminus of CA - G225R - that restores capsid formation and infectivity to these IP6-packaging-deficient mutants.

Furthermore, we show that G225R facilitates the in vitro assembly of purified CA into capsid-like particles (CLPs) at IP6 concentrations well below those required for WT CLP assembly. Using single-particle cryoEM, we solved structures of CA hexamer and hexameric lattice of mature CLPs harbouring the G225R mutation assembled in low-IP6 conditions. The high-resolution (2.7 [A]) cryoEM structure combined with molecular dynamics simulations of the G225R capsid revealed that the otherwise flexible and disordered C-terminus of CA becomes structured, extending to the pseudo two-fold hexamer-hexamer interface, thereby stabilizing the mature capsid. This work uncovers a structural mechanism by which HIV-1 adapts to a deficiency in IP6 packaging. Furthermore, the ability of G225R to promote mature capsid assembly in low-IP6 conditions provides a valuable tool for capsid-related studies and may indicate a heretofore unknown role for the unstructured C-terminus in HIV-1 capsid assembly.",NA,biorxiv

Current variants of the task have substantial limitations, however. Therefore, we created the Rodent Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (RENDS), a novel low-cost non-proprietary snout-only preclinical model of self-administration of nicotine aerosol. We validated the RENDS using two techniques. First, we measured fine particulate matter (2.5 microns or less in diameter), generated by e-cigarettes, and showed that levels in the chamber were similar to room air when RENDS was in operation, confirming that nicotine aerosol is sequestered in the nose port. We also demonstrated that rats robustly self-administer flavored nicotine aerosol, resulting in high blood levels of cotinine (the major nicotine metabolite) and spontaneous somatic withdrawal symptoms. Thus, we provide strong validation of the operation and function of the RENDS, opening the door to an open-source preclinical aerosol model of nicotine self-administration that is far less costly.

With the expansion of functional genomic (FG) datasets, which now include hundreds of thousands of tracks across various cell and tissue types, it is critical to establish scalable algorithms integrating thousands of diverse FG annotations with GWAS results.

ResultsWe propose BTS (Bayesian Tissue Score), a novel, highly efficient algorithm uniquely designed for 1) identifying affected cell types and functional elements (context-mapping) and 2) fine-mapping potentially causal variants in a context-specific manner using large collections of cell type-specific FG annotation tracks. BTS leverages GWAS summary statistics and annotation-specific Bayesian models to analyze genome-wide annotation tracks, including enhancers, open chromatin, and histone marks. We evaluated BTS on GWAS summary statistics for immune and cardiovascular traits, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Our results demonstrate that BTS is over 100x more efficient in estimating functional annotation effects and context-specific variant fine-mapping compared to existing methods.

Additionally, most existing algorithms perform poorly in cross-cell line generalization, where a model trained on one cell type is used to enhance high-resolution data in another cell type. In this work, we propose DiCARN (Dilated Cascading Residual Network) to overcome these challenges and improve Hi-C data resolution. DiCARN leverages dilated convolutions and cascading residuals to capture a broader context while preserving fine-grained genomic interactions. Additionally, we incorporate DNase-seq data into our model, providing a robust framework that demonstrates superior generalizability across cell lines in high-resolution Hi-C data reconstruction.

In addition, we previously identified qualitative individual differences in adaptation linked to the formation and updating of new memory processes. Here, we investigated quantitative and qualitative differences in visuomotor adaptation with a design incorporating repeated learning and forgetting blocks, allowing for precise estimation of individual learning and forgetting rates in fast-slow adaptation models. Participants engaged in a two-day online visuomotor adaptation task. They first adapted to a 30-degree perturbation to eight targets in three blocks separated by short blocks of no feedback trials. Approximately 24 hours later, they performed a no-feedback retention block and a relearning block. We clustered the participants into strong and weak learners based on adaptation levels at the end of day one and fitted a fast-slow system to the adaptation data. Strong learners exhibited a strong negative correlation between the estimated slow and fast processes, which predicted 24-hour retention and savings, respectively, supporting the engagement of a fast-slow system. The pronounced individual differences in the recruitment of the two processes were attributed to wide ranges of estimated learning rates. Conversely, weak learners exhibited a positive correlation between the two estimated processes, as well as retention but no savings, supporting the engagement of a single slow system. Finally, both during baseline and adaptation, reaction times were shorter for weak learners. Our findings thus revealed two distinct ways to learn in visuomotor adaptation and highlight the necessity of considering both quantitative and qualitative individual differences in studies of motor learning.",NA,biorxiv

Toxins from toxin-antitoxin systems have been implicated in persister formation as key contributors, although the biological targets of toxins remain largely unknown. Here, we report that Salmonella IbsA, a 19-amino-acid-long type I toxin, induces growth arrest and decreases intracellular ATP levels. An unbiased large-scale bacterial two-hybrid screen identified 54 IbsA-interacting targets, including proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and cell division. Among these, IbsA toxin specifically targets two subunits of the bacterial FoF1 ATP synthase. IbsA interacts with the a and b subunits in the membrane-bound Fo sector and inhibits proton translocation, thereby decreasing ATP levels. In turn, this IbsA-mediated decrease facilitates Salmonella spread between macrophages, promoting systemic infection. Accordingly, ibsA deletion decreases bacterial burden in organs and attenuates mouse virulence. Therefore, unlike other bacterial toxins, the IbsA toxin enhances Salmonella pathogenicity by decreasing the bacteriums ATP levels.",NA,biorxiv

Current mouse models do not adequately replicate human PSC-IBD, limiting mechanistic understanding and therapeutic development. This study uses Mdr2/Il10 double knockout (DKO) mice to examine microbiota roles in mediating colitis, colitis-associated colorectal dysplasia and hepatobiliary inflammation/fibrosis.

GoalDevelop and phenotype a chronic spontaneous PSC-IBD mouse model, emphasizing colitis, colonic dysplasia, hepatobiliary inflammation/ fibrosis and the functional roles of resident microbiota.

MethodsWe utilized germ-free (GF) and specific-pathogen-free Mdr2/Il10 DKO, Il10-/- and Mdr2-/- mice to model PSC-IBD. We monitored colonic dysplasia progression, colitis kinetics and severity by lipocalin-2, cytokine measurement, and tissue evaluations of colon and liver. We manipulated the microbiome to assess its functional effects.

ResultsDKO mice exhibited age- and region-specific accelerated colitis and spontaneous colonic dysplasia progressing to high-grade invasive adenocarcinomas. Despite aggressive colonic inflammation, DKO mice showed reduced hepatic fibrosis, increased hepatic reparative macrophages, and matrix metalloproteinase activity compared to Mdr2-/- mice. GF DKO had heightened liver inflammation and mortality with absent colitis and colonic dysplasia, reversed with microbial reconstitution from DKO mice. Changes in DKO primary/secondary bile acid profiles mirrored those in PSC-IBD.

ConclusionThe Mdr2/Il10 DKO model mirrors key factors in PSC-IBD patients in terms of inflammation and carcinogenesis. We found an important role for the dysbiotic microbiota in DKO mice for disease onset and progression.

Long-term monitoring of behavioral and physiological processes is critical for understanding complex brain-based phenomena and disorders that develop over extended periods, such as chronic stress, circadian disorders, and metabolic conditions. While digital phenotyping is available in humans using smart devices, there remains a deficit in rodent models. To address this lack of long-term rodent phenotyping, we introduce the ""Digital Homecage"" (DHC) system. Our system uses accessible components and is designed for seamless integration with brain recording technologies.

The Digital Homecage (DHC) allows uninterrupted, long-timescale recording of more than 20 behavioral metrics in single-housed mice, captured at sub-second resolution via video, operant interactions, and wheel-running data. This report demonstrates the DHCs capacity to enable continuous, automated tracking of behaviors like actigraphy, sleep, grooming, and food choice options over weeks, thereby opening up new avenues for longitudinal analyses of chronic conditions. Data collected reveal circadian patterns in multiple spontaneous behaviors, aligning with known nocturnal tendencies. The systems potential to facilitate groundbreaking observations on the long-term behavioral correlates of various neuropsychiatric syndromes is aided by open-source software and relatively low cost. The DHC sets the stage for community-driven innovation, potentially transforming our approach to studying complex traits of brain function and behavior in laboratory settings.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we present proteolysis-targeting vaccines (PROTAVs) that facilitate antigen proteolytic processing and cross-presentation to potentiate T cell responses for robust ICB combination immunotherapy of melanoma. PROTAVs are modular conjugates of protein/peptide antigens, E3 ligase-binding ligands, and linkers. In antigen-presenting cells (APCs), PROTAVs bind to E3 ligases to rapidly ubiquitinate PROTAV antigens, facilitating antigen proteolytic processing by proteasome, and thereby promoting antigen cross-presentation to T cells and potentiating CD8+ T cell responses. We developed a melanoma PROTAV using a tandem peptide of trivalent melanoma-associated antigens. Co-delivered by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with bivalent immunostimulant adjuvants, this PROTAV promotes the quantity and quality of melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells in mice. Further, combining PROTAV and ICB ameliorates the immunosuppressive melanoma microenvironment.

Interestingly, chemical modulation of the polarity of polyubiquitin adjacent to the tau core with the small molecule ubistatin B resulted in the repositioning of poorly structured densities towards positively charged residues on the highly structured core filament, leading to shifting of the protofilament-protofilament interface of certain vacuolar tauopathy tau filaments.

MethodsMuscle biopsies from three JDM patients and three age-matched controls were analysed using the Nanostring GeoMx(R) Digital Spatial Profiler. Regions of interest were selected based on muscle fibres without immune cells, immune cell infiltration and CD68+ macrophage enrichment. Differential gene expression, pathway analysis and pathways clustering analysis were conducted. Key findings were validated in 19 cases of JDM using immunohistochemistry and chemical stains, and a bulk RNAseq dataset of four cases of JDM.

ResultsJDM muscle tissues exhibited significant interferon pathway activation and mitochondrial dysfunction compared to controls. A 15-gene interferon signature was significantly elevated in JDM muscle and macrophage-enriched regions, correlating with clinical weakness. In contrast, mitochondrial dysregulation, characterized by downregulated respiratory chain pathways, was present regardless of interferon activity or muscle strength. The interferon-driven and mitochondrial signatures were replicated in an independent RNAseq dataset from JDM muscle; lack of association between interferon signature and mitochondrial dysregulation was validated in 19 cases by conventional staining methods. Clustering analysis revealed distinct transcriptomic profiles between JDM and control tissues, as well as between JDM patients with varying clinical phenotypes.

ConclusionsThis study highlights mitochondrial dysfunction as a consistent pathological feature in JDM muscle, which may be independent of interferon-driven inflammation. These findings highlight the potential for mitochondrial-targeted therapies in JDM management and emphasise the need for further studies to explore their therapeutic value.

Although the structure, function, and regulation of these pathways has been well established for many organisms, an understanding of their ecological and evolutionary dynamics lags behind. Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) deliver effectors between competing Gram-negative bacteria, including among mammalian gut Bacteroidales, resulting in the evolution of elaborate defense mechanisms that protect against T6SS attack. One such mechanism is the recombinase-associated acquired interbacterial defence (rAID) system, which harbors arrays of orphan immunity genes that diverge in sequence from T6SS-associated cognate immunity genes. It is not known if such sequence divergence impacts rAID orphan immunity function, or how rAID distribution across microbiomes relates to the T6SS. Here, we show that divergent rAID orphan immunity factors that possess SUKH domains allow bacteria to survive intoxication by cognate effectors. Such protection is due to high affinity protein-protein interactions between orphan immunity and effector that are comparable to that of cognate effector-immunity. Unlike other examples of T6SS effector-immunity interactions, we find that the binding interface is comprised of electrostatic interactions with a high degree of redundancy underlying its protective capacity. Finally, we quantify orphan immunity and effector gene abundance and dynamics across human gut metagenomes, revealing patterns of co-occurrence indicative of positive selection. Population genetic analyses of longitudinal data suggests that orphan immunity genes accumulate non-synonymous mutations that lie at the predicted effector-immunity interface. Together, our findings establish rAID orphan immunity genes as important bacterial fitness determinants in the human gut.",NA,biorxiv

Type 2 diabetes is associated with BBB dysfunction, dyslipidaemia, and an increased risk of AD. However, alterations in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL)-A{beta} homeostasis and its downstream effects on the BBB in a diabetes context remain explored. This study aimed to 1) investigate, in a preclinical model of diabetes, the hypothesis that diabetes-induced impairments in TRL-A{beta} metabolism might compromise BBB integrity and exacerbate cognitive function and behavioural changes, and 2) assess the efficacy of interventions that improve TRL catabolism, including probucol, HA1, and ApoC3 siRNA, to prevent disease progression by lowering circulating TRL-A{beta} levels.

MethodsFive-week-old db/db mice underwent a 9- or 23-weeks dietary interventions with probucol, a probucol prodrug HA1, or a standard diet with four-weekly injections of ApoC3 siRNA. Db/+ mice served as negative controls for each treatment duration. Blood levels of A{beta} and ApoB were measured using ELISA. Immunofluorescence imaging was used to quantify enterocytic levels of A{beta} and ApoB, and assess changes in neurovascular integrity (IgG, PDGFR{beta}, ZO1, occludin), neuroinflammation (GFAP, Iba1), and cerebral oxidative stress (8OHdG).

ResultsOur results indicate that diabetes increased the abundance of plasma amyloid, specifically A{beta}42, which correlated with enterocytic abundance, suggesting exaggerated postprandial excretion. Disrupted plasma amyloid homeostasis was associated with BBB breakdown, including diminished barrier function, and the loss of pericytes and astrocytes. Provision of the probucol analogue, HA1, normalised plasma and enterocytic amyloidemia concomitant with the preservation of the neurovascular junction. Treatment with ApoC3 siRNA attenuated plasma A{beta}42 and modestly reduced neurovascular inflammation.

ConclusionThe findings further support the hypothesis that aberrant peripheral metabolism of lipoprotein-A{beta} is associated with microvascular corruption and the development of anxiety-like behaviour. HA1 is more effective than probucol or ApoC3 siRNA in positively modulating lipoprotein-amyloid homeostasis in db/db mice and maintaining central capillary integrity.

Here, we aimed to (i) identify neurobiologically similar groups by integrating resting-state functional connectivity and prodromal symptom data and (ii) discern discriminating symptom profiles and brain connectivity patterns in the identified sub-groups.

MethodsOur sample (N=922) was extracted from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and included individuals ages 12-21 years with fMRI and self-reported psychopathology data. Analyses were conducted separately for youth and early adults. We first constructed a two-layer network using pair-wise similarity distances between participants based on resting-state functional connectivity and prodromal positive psychosis symptoms. We then performed community detection via a multiplex stochastic block model to identify subject clusters.

ResultsWe identified 2 blocks or communities for both the youth (n=458 and 179) and early adult (n=173 and 112) groups. Connection parameter estimates of the neuroimaging layer were nearly identical between blocks for both age groups whereas there was significant variation for the symptom layer. Psychopathology symptom and brain system segregation profiles were consistent across age groups. The youth block (n=458) with higher salience network segregation values had higher mean scores for prodromal symptoms. However, the early adult block (n=173) with lower salience network segregation had higher mean prodromal scores.

ConclusionsBy integrating global similarities in brain connectivity and prodromal symptoms, we identified distinct subgroups. These groups show differences in symptom profiles and network segregation in youth and early adults, indicating significant variations in developmental paths for psychosis spectrum.",NA,biorxiv

We previously showed that -catenin is highly phosphorylated in an unstructured region that links mechanosensitive middle- and actin-binding domains (known as the P-linker region), but the cellular processes that promote -catenin phosphorylation have remained elusive. Here, we leverage a previously published phospho-proteomic data set to show that the -catenin P-linker region is maximally phosphorylated during mitosis. By reconstituting -catenin Crispr KO MDCK with wild-type, phospho-mutant and mimic forms of -catenin, we show that full phosphorylation restrains mitotic cell rounding in the apical direction, strengthening interactions between dividing and non-dividing neighbors to limit epithelial barrier leak. Since major scaffold components of adherens junctions, tight junctions and desmosomes are also differentially phosphorylated during mitosis, we reason that epithelial cell division may be a tractable system to understand how junction complexes are coordinately regulated to sustain barrier function under tension-generating morphogenetic processes.",NA,biorxiv

Reduced signaling of these two receptors below a threshold in enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDCs) leads to a molecular tipping point at which otherwise lesser cellular defects result in aganglionosis. To elucidate the mechanisms leading to enteric neuronal loss from these genetic defects, we generated four strains of mice carrying reduced function alleles at Ret or Ednrb or both, along with their wildtype alleles. ENS tissue- and single-cell gene expression profiling of the developing and postnatal gastrointestinal tract in five mouse models, with various combinations of mutant alleles, revealed 3 major insights: (i) Ret and Ednrb deficiency, rather than complete loss, is sufficient to induce HSCR, (ii) Ret and Ednrb demonstrate strong trans interactions, and (3) disruption of this interaction leads to cellular fate changes to compensate for neuronal loss. This study of targeted mouse models of a multifactorial disorder reveals how increasing dosage of genetic defects within a GRN leads to quantifiably increasing dysregulation from genotype to gene expression to cellular identity to function. Importantly, our studies establish that aganglionosis results only with severely reduced gene expression at both receptor genes and their consequent disruption of normal and compensatory cell fate trajectories.",NA,biorxiv

Current annual vaccines target specific strains, requiring accurate prediction for effective neutralization. Despite sequence diversity across phylogenetic groups, the hemagglutinin (HA) head domains structure remains highly conserved. Utilizing this conservation, we designed cross-group chimeric HAs that combine antigenic surfaces from distant strains. By structure-guided transplantation of receptor-binding site (RBS) residues, we displayed an H3 RBS on an H1 HA scaffold. These chimeric immunogens elicit cross-group polyclonal responses capable of neutralizing both base and distal strains. Additionally, the chimeras integrate heterotrimeric immunogens, enhancing modular vaccine design. This approach enables the inclusion of diverse strain segments to generate broad polyclonal responses. In the future, such modular immunogens may serve as tools for evaluating immunodominance and refining immunization strategies, offering potential to bridge and enhance immune responses in individuals with pre-existing immunity. This strategy holds promise for advancing universal influenza vaccine development.

While deep learning methods have significantly advanced protein structure prediction by extracting evolutionary constraints from homologous sequences of a target protein, they struggle with immune proteins due to the limited number of known structures and the lack of homologous sequences in hypervariable regions. To address this challenge, we propose ImmuneFold, a transfer learning approach that fine-tunes ESMFold specifically for immune proteins. We leverage low-rank adaption (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that requires considerably less memory and substantially fewer parameters. Evaluations on various immune proteins, including T-cell receptors, antibodies, and nanobodies, demonstrate that ImmuneFold outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we apply ImmuneFold to develop a zero-shot protocol for TCR-epitope binding prediction. Unlike previous supervised methods suffering from severe overfitting due to limited experimental binding data, our approach first predicts TCR-epitope structure using ImmuneFold and then directly estimates the binding affinity by calculating Rosseta energy. Evaluations on experimental binding datasets suggest that our method is robust and accurate in predicting TCR-epitope binding. In summary, ImmuneFold demonstrates accurate predictions of immune protein structures and TCR-epitope binding, highlighting its potential to advance the development of immunotherapies.",NA,biorxiv

Variation in intrasexual aggression across species is likely driven by variation in resource availability and distribution. While males primarily compete over access to mates, females are likely to compete over resources to maximize offspring quantity and/or quality, such as food or breeding sites. To date, however, most studies have focused on male aggression and we know little about drivers of female aggression across species. To investigate potential reproductive drivers of female aggression, we tested the relationship between three reproductive traits and aggression in eight Drosophila species. Using machine learning classifiers developed for D. melanogaster, we quantified aggressive behaviours displayed in the presence of yeast for mated and unmated females. We found that female aggression was correlated with ovariole number across species, suggesting that females that lay more eggs are more aggressive. A need for resources for egg production or oviposition sites may therefore be drivers of female aggression, though other potential hypotheses are discussed.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we explore that idea by creating DNA tetrahedra held together with sticky ends that contain identical base pairing interactions but different terminal stacking interactions. Testing all 16 possible combinations, we found that the melting temperature of DNA tetrahedra varied by up to 10 {degrees}C from altering a single base stack in the design.

Despite the established roles of SIR2 and STAND in prokaryotic and eukaryotic immunity, the mechanism underlying their collaboration remains unclear. Here we present cryo-EM structures of EfAvs5 filaments, elucidating the mechanisms of dimerization, filamentation, filament clustering, ATP binding and NAD+ hydrolysis, all of which are crucial for anti-phage defense. The SIR2 domains and NODs engage in the intra- and inter-dimer interaction to form an individual filament, while the outward C-terminal domains contribute to bundle formation. Filamentation potentially stabilizes the dimeric SIR2 configuration, thereby activating the NADase activity of EfAvs5. EfAvs5 is deficient in the ATPase activity, but elevated ATP concentrations can impede its NADase activity.

During development, mechanosensitive ion channels such as TRPV4, PIEZO1, and PIEZO2 regulate tissue morphogenesis by transducing mechanical signals. Their roles in regeneration, however, have yet to be thoroughly explored. To investigate this, we assessed the expression of these channels during limb regeneration using single-cell RNA sequencing dataset, hybridization chain reaction fluorescence in-situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence. Additionally, functional relevance was tested by pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 and PIEZO1/2 mechanosensitive ion channels during limb regeneration.

ResultsWhile PIEZO1 expression was undetected, we observed TRPV4 and PIEZO2 expression in uninjured cartilage and at both the mid-bud and palette blastemal stages of limb regeneration. TRPV4 and PIEZO2 were highly expressed in chondrocytes, with PIEZO2 enriched in fibroblasts. Inhibition with GSK205, a TRPV4 antagonist, significantly reduced calcium influx and humeral length without inhibiting cartilage differentiation. Treatment with gadolinium chloride, a broad spectrum mechanosensitive ion channel inhibitor, had no significant morphological impact.

ConclusionsTRPV4 and PIEZO2 are dynamically regulated during axolotl limb regeneration. Selective TRPV4 inhibition altered final limb morphology, but chondrogenesis was unaffected. This suggests a role for these genes in shaping tissue architecture during limb regeneration.

(RMSD, 1.44 W{middle dot}kg-1), HTK (1.30 W{middle dot}kg-1), and RE3 (1.27 W{middle dot}kg-1) equations but much worse for the ACSM equation (1.82 W{middle dot}kg-1). Agreement on uphill slopes was highest for the HTK (RMSD, 1.45 W{middle dot}kg-1) and RE3 (1.41 W{middle dot}kg-1) equations with less precision noted for the ACSM (2.17 W{middle dot}kg-1) and Minetti et al. (2.18 W{middle dot}kg-1) equations. When estimating [M] during downhill running, the RE3 equation performed marginally better (RMSD, 1.45 W{middle dot}kg-1) than the Minetti et al. equation (1.57 W{middle dot}kg-1).

ConclusionThe improved RE3 and HTK equations estimate metabolic rates during level and graded running with improved accuracy and precision. We provide a publicly available web-based metabolic rate calculator that simplifies estimation for researchers, practitioners, and runners alike.",NA,biorxiv

It remains unclear whether autoinflammatory events precede or follow hyperkeratotic changes in hair follicle (HF) epithelia.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized HF cell populations in HS patients and investigated their role in disease pathogenesis. We uncovered two distinct differentiation trajectories of HF stem cells (HF-SCs): one leading to interfollicular epidermis (IFE) basal cells enriched in inflammatory pathways, and another giving rise to outer root sheath (ORS) cells associated with keratinization. In HS lesions, both populations displayed altered inflammatory phenotypes and were closely linked to immune cell infiltration, pointing to a role in disease heterogeneity. By integrating clinical features with HF cell composition from 49 HS patients, we identified three major endotypes: (i) an inflammatory subtype, marked by T cell infiltration and an expansion of IFE basal cells; (ii) a keratinizing subtype, characterized by ORS enrichment and minimal inflammation; and a mixed subtype, exhibiting features of follicular remodeling, fistula formation, and variable immune involvement.

These findings provide novel insights into the epithelial-immune interactions that drive HS and support a stratified therapeutic approach tailored to the specific HF dysfunctions of each patient subgroup.

While improvements in protein labeling techniques have allowed for the measurement of proteomes with increased sensitivity, measuring cell type-specific proteomes in vivo remains challenging. One of the most useful pipelines is bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) with the MetRS* system, consisting of a transgenic mouse line expressing a mutant methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS*) controlled by Cre recombinase expression. This system allows for cell type-specific labeling of proteins with a non-canonical amino acid (azidonorleucine, ANL), which can be subsequently conjugated to affinity or fluorescent tags using click chemistry. Click-modified proteins can then be visualized, purified and identified. The reduction in sample complexity allows for the detection of small changes in protein composition. Here we describe a multicopy MetRS* mouse line (3xMetRS* mouse line), which exhibits markedly enhanced ANL protein labeling, boosting the sensitivity and temporal resolution of the system and eliminating the need for working under methionine depletion conditions. Cell type-specific in vivo labeling is possible even in heterozygous animals, thus offering an enormous advantage for crossing the line into mutation and disease-specific backgrounds. Using the 3xMetRS* line we identified the in vivo proteome of a sparse cell population - the dopaminergic neurons of the olfactory bulb and furthermore determined newly synthesized proteins after short labeling durations following a single intraperitoneal ANL injection.",NA,biorxiv

The kinetoplastid flagellar cytoskeleton consists of a nine-microtubule doublet axoneme; further structural elaborations, which can vary between species and life cycle stages, include the assembly of axonemal dynein complexes, a pair of singlet microtubules and the extra-axonemal paraflagellar rod. The intracellular amastigote forms of Leishmania spp. build a short, non-motile cilium whose function has remained enigmatic. Here we used a panel of 25 barcoded promastigote cell lines, including mutants lacking genes encoding flagellar assembly proteins, cytoskeletal proteins required for normal motility, or flagellar membrane proteins to examine how these defects impact on their virulence in macrophages and mice. Mutants lacking intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein 88 were severely attenuated indicating that assembly of a flagellum is necessary to allow for Leishmania survival in a mammalian host. A similarly severe loss of virulence was observed upon deletion of BBS2, a core component of the BBSome complex, which may act as a cargo adapter for IFT. By contrast, promastigotes that were unable to beat their flagella due to loss of PF16 could establish an infection and only showed a small reduction of parasite burden in vivo compared to the parental cell lines. These results confirm that flagellar motility is not necessary for mammalian infection but flagellum assembly and the integrity of the BBSome are essential for pathogenicity.",NA,biorxiv

A critical aspect of achieving high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions is accurately determining and correcting for the microscopes contrast transfer function (CTF). The CTF introduces defocus-dependent distortions during imaging; if not properly accounted for, the CTF can distort features in and limit the resolution of 3D reconstructions. For tilt-series data used in cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), CTF estimation becomes even more challenging due to the tilt of the specimen, which introduces a defocus gradient across the field of view, as well as the low dose and signal in individual tilt images. Here, we describe a simple algorithm to improve the accuracy of CTF estimation of tilted images by leveraging the tilt-series alignment parameters determined for tomographic reconstruction to explicitly account for the tilted specimen geometry. In brief, each tilt image is divided into patches, each of which are then stretched according to their defocus shift. These are then summed to provide a coherent power spectra at the tilt axis, which can then be used in standard CTF estimation algorithms. This uses all the data in each image to enhance the visibility of Thon rings, thereby improving high-resolution CTF estimation and subsequent enhancements in the resolution of subtomogram averages.",NA,biorxiv

In vitro evolution has enabled the discovery of ribozymes that catalyze diverse chemical reactions, but it is likely that many catalytic activities of RNA remain to be uncovered. Expanding our understanding of the biochemical capabilities of RNA, especially new ribozyme functions related to RNA assembly, will help to refine models of primordial genome replication and, more broadly, the origin and evolution of early life. Here, we report the discovery of a novel ribozyme ligase that catalyzes the attack of the 2'-hydroxyl group of an RNA substrate on the 5'-triphosphate of a second RNA, but only when the substrate RNA possesses a 3'-phosphate vicinal to its nucleophilic 2'-hydroxyl group. This activity emerged unexpectedly during a directed evolution experiment designed to isolate ribozyme ligases that use 5'-triphosphorylated RNA oligonucleotides as substrates. Because the 3'-phosphate group on the RNA substrate does not directly participate in the ligation reaction, it would be extremely challenging to design a selection strategy to isolate ribozyme ligases with this unique reactivity. The ligases requirement for an RNA 3'-phosphate group on the substrate resembles enzymatic mechanisms found in protein-based RNA repair pathways. We propose that ribozyme-catalyzed ligation of 3'-phosphorylated RNA could have enabled the repair of cleaved RNA strands in primordial cells. We demonstrate that our in vitro evolved ribozymes ligate themselves specifically to 3'-phosphorylated RNA fragments present in heterogenous mixtures of cellular RNA, demonstrating their potential utility as enrichment reagents for profiling RNA cleavage products in transcriptomic studies. Our findings not only report a new catalytic reactivity in RNA but also provide insights into ribozyme evolution, primordial RNA repair, and potential applications in RNA sequencing.",NA,biorxiv

A potentially powerful although under-characterized approach to identifying nucleic activation within the brainstem is masked independent component analysis (mICA), which restricts signal decomposition to the brainstem itself, thus aiming to reduce the strong effect of physiological noise in nearby regions such as ventricles and large arteries. In this study, we systematically investigate the use of mICA to uncover signatures of autonomic activation in the brainstem at rest. We apply mICA on 40 subjects in a high-resolution resting state 7T dataset following different strategies for dimensionality selection, denoising, and component classification. We show that among the noise mitigation techniques investigated, cerebrospinal fluid denoising makes the largest impact in terms of mICA outcomes. We further demonstrate that across preprocessing pipelines and previously reported results the majority of components are spatially reproducible, but temporal outcomes differ widely depending on denoising strategy. Evaluating both hand-labelling and whole-brain specificity criteria, we develop an intuitive framework for mICA classifications. Finally, we make a comparison between mICA and atlas-based segmentations of brainstem nuclei, finding little consistency between these two approaches. Based on our evaluation of the effects of methodology on mICA and its relationship to other signals of interest in the brainstem, we provide recommendations for future uses of mICA to identify autonomically-relevant BOLD fluctuations in subcortical structures.",NA,biorxiv

HD-ptau mice were defined by ptau+ cells in the ADn and ptau+ axon terminals in postsynaptic target regions. Despite being able to learn spatial memory tasks, HD-ptau mice exhibited increased looping behavior during spatial learning and made a greater number of head turns during memory recall, consistent with disorientation. Using in vivo extracellular recordings, we identified ptau-expressing ADn cells and found that ADn cells from HD-ptau mice had reduced directionality and altered burst firing.

Dyads (N=60) discussed pressing societal problems while being instructed to either persuade their partner or compromise with each other. Our analysis uncovered three key insights: First, individuals instructed to compromise rather than persuade tended to agree more at the end of the session. Second, hyperscanning and linguistic analyses revealed that encouraging compromise resulted in increased exploration during conversations; dyads given compromise instructions traversed more diverse mental states and topics. Third, heightened exploration was linked to greater eventual agreement. Notably, the effect of the compromise instruction on agreement was entirely mediated by the degree of exploration.

Two main hypotheses are usually mentioned to explain it, the kinship and the sexual antagonism theories, together related to a conflict over resource allocation. Between the different common assumptions expected under these theories, directional selection on imprinted genes could help to discriminate the best theory to explain imprinting because the selection is expected, in regulatory or in coding regions respectively. But, so far, most researches that studied selection in imprinted genes have focused on autogamous species, whose conflict for ressources allocation is expected to be low. Moreover, kinship theory is expected to promote intense antagonistic coevolution between imprinted genes, but this has never been tested so far.

To address these knowledge gaps, using phylogenetic and population genomics approaches, we searched for signals of selection on imprinted genes across the Brassicaceae family and in allogamous and autogamous populations of Arabidopsis lyrata, and we investigated signals of coevolution across imprinted genes. Overall, we found that non-imprinted endosperm genes presented signals of balancing selection, as expected in the case of unresolved intralocus conflict. Moreover, according to kinship theory, the PEGs exhibited signals of directional selection but not in coding regions and this signal was sensitive to mating systems. Finally, we found imprinted genes showing signals of coevolution, but not related to specific sites, suggesting that the coevolution is driven by other interactions than protein, as predicted by kinship theory.",NA,biorxiv

We tested whether theta, alpha, and beta phase consistency predicts memory encoding dynamics in neurosurgical patients performing delayed free recall tasks with either unrelated (N=188) or categorized words (N=157). We observed widespread post-stimulus phase consistency (3- 21 Hz) and, crucially, identified distinct frequency-specific patterns predictive of successful encoding. Specifically, increased early-list item recall was significantly correlated across subjects with increased theta (3-7 Hz) phase consistency. Subsequent recall analyses, controlling for serial position, revealed distinct frequency signatures for successfully encoded items: theta (3-6 Hz) and alpha (9-14 Hz) for unrelated lists, and theta (3-6 Hz) and beta (14-19 Hz) for categorized lists. Regional analyses for unrelated lists highlighted the lateral temporal cortex for theta effects and the prefrontal cortex for both theta and alpha consistency. These findings provide novel evidence for the frequency-specific presence of increased phase consistency during episodic encoding, revealing its sensitivity to both item context and temporal position within a learning sequence.

Significance StatementNeural oscillations are implicated in human memory encoding, but their precise roles are still being defined. Our study leverages large-scale intracranial EEG datasets from participants undergoing word recall experiments, and introduces analytical innovations for robustly quantifying phase consistency with differing numbers of recalled versus forgotten items. This methodology reveals that phase consistency across different frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta) predicts memory formation. We demonstrate a specific role for theta consistency in encoding early list items and show that the brain adaptively recruits different oscillatory patterns (alpha or beta alongside theta) depending on item context (unrelated vs. categorized lists). These findings advance our understanding of the frequency-specific neural mechanisms supporting human episodic memory, revealing how the brain adapts its encoding strategies based on informational structure.",NA,biorxiv

In a first-of-its-kind study in India, we comprehensively characterized microbial communities and the prevalence of AMR genes in the Chennai Metro system. Of the 96 surface swab samples collected from 12 stations across two metro lines, 47 samples passed quality control and were subsequently analyzed using whole genome metagenomic sequencing. Comparative analysis with global urban microbiome datasets revealed distinct microbial profiles, including eight core species unique to Chennai. Surface type significantly influenced microbial diversity, with kiosks displaying the highest diversity levels.

Our functional studies demonstrated that overexpression of IQGAP3 increases {beta}-catenin levels, while IQGAP3 depletion reduces {beta}-catenin levels in gastric cancer cells. Mechanistically, IQGAP3 disrupts Axin1-CK1 interaction, thereby inhibiting {beta}-catenin phosphorylation and ultimately leading to its accumulation.

We assessed the metabolic activity of each patient based on gene expression profiles, revealing significant downregulation of vital metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, indicative of hypometabolism. Our analysis also highlighted dysregulation in lipid, vitamin, amino acid, and heme metabolism, which may contribute to the neurodevelopmental delays associated with ASD.

Thousands of ATAC-seq samples have been collected that hold information about chromatin accessibility across diverse cell types and contexts, but most of these are not paired with genetic information and come from diverse distinct projects and laboratories.

ResultsWe report here joint genotyping, chromatin accessibility peak calling, and discovery of quantitative trait loci which influence chromatin accessibility (caQTLs), demonstrating the capability of performing caQTL analysis on a large scale in a diverse sample set without pre-existing genotype information. Using 10,293 profiling samples representing 1,454 unique donor individuals across 653 studies from public databases, we catalog 23,381 caQTLs in total. After joint discovery analysis, we cluster samples based on accessible chromatin profiles to identify context-specific caQTLs. We find that caQTLs are strongly enriched for annotations of gene regulatory elements across diverse cell types and tissues and are often strongly linked with genetic variation associated with changes in expression (eQTLs), indicating that caQTLs can mediate genetic effects on gene expression. We demonstrate sharing of causal variants for chromatin accessibility and diverse complex human traits, enabling a more complete picture of the genetic mechanisms underlying complex human phenotypes.

Conventional classifiers typically do not explicitly account for these artifacts, resulting in inaccurate and misleading sleep stage scoring. To address this gap, we developed a suite of artifact-aware sleep stage classifiers trained specifically using forehead EEG data, leveraging two comprehensive datasets--Wearanize+ and Donders2022--that contain concurrent forehead EEG and clinical PSG recordings.

Biochemical and structural experiments show that in contrast to the Phactrs, substrate recruitment and catalytic efficiency of the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Spinophilin fusions is primarily determined by substrate interaction with the PDZ domain adjoining their RVxF-{Phi}{Phi}-R-W motifs, rather than by recognition of the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove.

However, the overall scale of perturbations, especially when considering combinations of genes for perturbation, cannot be tackled exhaustively in the lab. An alternative is to use an iterative design: By leveraging the modularity and sparsity of gene circuits along with prior biological knowledge, we can predict the impact of unseen genetic perturbations on these profiles and group genes with similar effects into co-functional modules, followed by a new round of Perturb-Seq to test these predictions and improve the overall performance of the model.

Human pathogenic Yersinia, including the plague agent Y. pestis and its close relative Y. pseudotuberculosis, require the type III secretion system (T3SS) virulence factor to subvert host defense mechanisms and colonize host tissues. The Yersinia T3SS is encoded on the IncFII plasmid for Yersiniavirulence (pYV). Several layers of gene regulation enables a large increase in expression of Yersinia T3SS genes at mammalian body temperature. Surprisingly, T3SS expression is also controlled at the level of gene dosage. The number of pYV molecules relative to the number of chromosomes per cell, referred to as plasmid copy number, increases with temperature. The ability to increase and maintain elevated pYV plasmid copy number, and therefore T3SS gene dosage, at 37{ring}C is important for Yersinia virulence. In addition, pYV is highly stable in Yersinia at all temperatures, despite being dispensable for growth outside the host. Yet how Yersinia reinforces elevated plasmid replication and plasmid stability remains unclear. In this study, we show that the chromosomal gene pcnB encoding the polyadenylase PAP I is required for regulation of pYV plasmid copy number (PCN), maintenance of pYV in the bacterial population outside the host, robust T3SS activity, and Yersinia virulence in a mouse infection model. Likewise, pcnB/PAP I is also required for robust expression of the Shigella flexneri virulence plasmid-encoded T3SS. Furthermore, Yersinia and Shigella pcnB/PAP I is required for maintaining normal PCN of model antimicrobial resistance (AMR) plasmids whose replication is regulated by sRNA, thereby increasing antibiotic resistance by ten-fold. These data suggest that pcnB/PAP I contributes to the spread and stabilization of virulence and AMR plasmids in bacterial pathogens, and is essential in maintaining the gene dosage required to mediate plasmid-encoded traits. Importantly pcnB/PAP I has been bioinformatically identified in many species of bacteria despite being studied in only a few species to date. Our work highlights the potential importance of pcnB/PAP I in antibiotic resistance, and shows for the first time that pcnB/PAP I reinforces PCN and virulence plasmid stability in natural pathogenic hosts with a direct impact on bacterial virulence.",NA,biorxiv

This type of adaptive behavior is studied using perceptual decision-making (PDM) tasks that feature block-wise changes in stimulus-response-outcome contingencies. Despite extensive research on PDM, there exists no widely accepted mechanistic model of the decision process that captures trial-by-trial adaptation to contingency changes. To address this gap, we first specified three signal detection theory-based models of adaptive PDM. Next, we identified several scenarios in which these models make diverging predictions. For experimental testing, we subjected rats and pigeons to a two-choice auditory discrimination task comprising a sequence of experimental conditions that differed in their stimulusresponse-outcome contingencies. The contingency manipulations were implemented through the concomitant manipulation of reward probabilities, stimulus presentation probabilities and stimulus discriminability across two stimulus-response categories. We find that both rats and pigeons exhibit condition-specific response biases that increase total reward across the entire range of experimental conditions. However, none of the models were able to fit the choice data across all experimental conditions. Through detailed behavior analysis, we demon-strate that learning is driven by the integration of rewards, but not reward omissions. Moreover, model-based analyses reveal that reward integration is influenced by two additional factors, namely perceptual uncertainty and the alignment of steady-state response ratios to relative (rather than absolute) reward differences between the two choices. A model incorporating these factors accounts well for behavioral data across experimental conditions for both species and connects the arguably most influential framework of perception, signal detection theory, with a learning mechanism operating at the level of single trials which, in the steady state, produces behavior consistent with the generalized matching law from animal learning theory.

2 Author summaryHumans and other animals rely on their senses and experience to categorize objects and pursue their goals. For example, a mushroom hunter uses sight, smell and touch as well as knowledge of the local biota to decide whether to pick a particular mushroom. The consequences of erring may be dire - food intoxication if savoring a poisonous exemplar, or a meager dinner if too many palatable mushrooms are rejected. Also, the hunters decision may be influenced by ambient lighting conditions or his estimate of how likely it is to encounter poisonous mushrooms in a certain area. Our work is concerned with the algorithms that animals use to make such decisions and how they adapt when circumstances, such as stimulus discriminability, change. We show that mathematical models that incorporate the animals uncertainty about the type of stimulus currently being perceived make very similar choices as the animals. Furthermore, we find that the animals balance their choices by considering relative, rather than absolute, reward expectations, reflecting a long-standing principle of animal learning theory. Together, these features collectively allow animals to obtain nearly as many rewards as theoretically possible.",NA,biorxiv

Conventional biomarkers often overlook the complex and dynamic nature of gene regulatory changes, while existing predictive models frequently lack automation and robust external validation. Thus, we present CRISGI (Critical tran-Sient Gene Interaction), a computational framework that detects early-warning signals of infection by identifying dynamic changes in gene-gene interactions--termed critical transient interactions--from bulk RNA-seq data. CRISGI leverages critical transition (CT) theory to capture a GRNs unstable intermediate state, known as the CT stage, before irreversible phenotypic shifts. Applied to a human challenge study with H3N2, CRISGI identified 128 critical transition edges (128-TER). These were used to train predictive models capable of forecasting symptom status and onset timing. 128-TER was then validated across six temporal transcriptomic datasets involving three respiratory viruses (H3N2, H1N1, HRV). The 128-TER consistently distinguished symptomatic individuals, predicted infection onset, and revealed phenotype-specific enrichment patterns. Notably, CRISGI captured immune-related transitions involving interferon-stimulated genes (e.g., IFIT1, CXCL10), underscoring their role in early host defense. CRISGI advances early-warning biomarker discovery by integrating interaction-level dynamics and predictive modeling. Its reproducibility across viruses highlights shared immune activation pathways, supporting its utility in both research and clinical contexts.",NA,biorxiv

Here we identify a novel monosynaptic glutamatergic input to the LC from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We show VTA glutamatergic axons project robustly to the dorsal pons and provide direct glutamatergic transmission onto LC neurons. Despite weak summation of this synaptic input, optogenetic activation of these axons in LC enhances tonic firing and facilitates real-time and conditioned aversive behavior. We hypothesized this VTA-LC glutamatergic projection may provide modulatory synaptic integration with other excitatory inputs. To test this notion, we used coincident photostimulation of VTA-LC axons and local electrical stimulation and demonstrate enhanced burst induction in the LC. To determine whether this integration also occurs in vivo, we took an analogous approach using the Punishment Risk Task to measure the reward-seeking behavior during unpredictable probabilistic punishment. Here, optogenetic activation of the VTA-LC glutamatergic projections with a concurrent noxious stimulus did not delay the reward-seeking behavior, but increased the probability of task failure. Together, our findings identify a novel VTA-LC glutamatergic projection that drives concurrent synaptic summation during salient stimuli to promote behavioral avoidance.",NA,biorxiv

Quantifying the effects of molecular crowding on DNA supercoiling is essential to relating in-vitro experiments to in-vivo DNA supercoiling. We use single molecule magnetic tweezers to study DNA supercoiling in the presence of dehydrating or crowding co-solutes. To study DNA supercoiling, we apply a stretching force of 0.8 pN to the DNA and then rotate one end of the DNA to induce supercoiling. In a 200 mM NaCl buffer without co-solutes, negatively supercoiled DNA absorbs some of the tortional stress by forming locally melted DNA regions. The base-pairs in these locally melted regions are believed to adopt a configuration where nucleotide base pairing is disrupted. We find that the presence of a dehydrating co-solute like glycerol further destabilizes base-pairs in negatively supercoiled DNA. The presence of polyethylene glycol, commonly used as a crowding agent, suppresses local strand separation and results in plectoneme formation even when DNA is negatively supercoiled. The results presented in this letter suggest further directions for studies of DNA supercoiling and supercoiled DNA - protein interactions in molecular conditions that approximate in-vivo molecular composition.

SIGNIFICANCEAccurate modelling of DNA mechanics is central to interpreting results of single molecule studies of DNA mechanics and DNA-protein interactions. While the effect of molecular conditions on thermal stability of short and relaxed DNA has been studied, the influence of molecular conditions on DNA supercoiling has not been explored. We present the first single molecule study of DNA supercoiling in the presence of crowding and dehydrating co-solutes. We observe that co-solutes can increase or completely suppress mechanical stress-driven base-pair disruption in negatively supercoiled DNA. This change of DNA supercoiling is likely to significantly affect the function of DNA-binding proteins. Our results motivate the need for systematic exploration of DNA supercoiling in presence of co-solutes to accurately relate in-vitro DNA-protein interactions to in-vivo DNA-protein interactions.",10.1016/j.bpj.2025.04.024,biorxiv

It should be particularly topical in the case of soil organisms, which represent the majority of known species, but still suffer from a considerable taxonomic knowledge deficit. We propose here an estimation of the global number of earthworm species based on the Joppa approach, which models taxonomic effort over time in order to estimate the total number of known and as yet unknown species in a given taxa. Our Bayesian estimation of this model allows us to propose a global diversity of the order of 30,000 species. However, the uncertainty around this estimate is considerable due to severe undersampling and as the model cannot unambiguously decide whether we are describing few species because of a small pool of as yet unknown species, or because of a lack of taxonomic efficiency. This means that the 5,679 species and subspecies already described only represent around 20% of the global number of earthworm species. Considering the current rate of new species description, we calculate that it would take at least 120 years to describe all the species existing on Earth.

Previous studies showed that these features could enhance movement of pollinators such as bees, increasing pollination success of bee pollinated plants. However, it remains unclear if these effects extend to communities of plants pollinated by other pollinators.

We conducted a field experiment where we measured the pollination of phytometer plant communities linked by linear features. We constructed six 30m artificial linear features in both urban and rural meadows in the Southwest UK, and placed plant communities on either end of these linear features, comparing these to phytometers without linking linear features. Plant communities were assembled with seven species known to attract different groups of insect pollinators including bees, flies, and moths. We tested self-incompatibility of plant species and used their seed set to measure pollination.

We found that linear features significantly improved the pollination success of three bee pollinated species, whilst the seed production of fly and moth pollinated species were either unaffected or less affected. Overall, it is likely that linear features benefit the pollination of some plant species more than others.

Our results suggest that linear features play an important role in maintaining pollination for some plant species, highlighting the importance of evaluating community-level impacts of corridors on pollination. Given the importance of bees as pollinators, linear features can provide a practical strategy to conserve and improve pollination, but where species are fly or moth pollinated, alternative strategies may need to be considered.",NA,biorxiv

Computational analyses separated the principal and accessory members in chicken and lizard, identifying molecular signatures distinguishing either member from single cones and rods in the same species. Comparative transcriptomic analyses suggest that both the principal and accessory originated from ancestral red cones. Furthermore, the gene expression variation among cone subtypes mirrors their spectral order (red[-&gt;] green[-&gt;] blue[-&gt;] UV), suggesting a constraint in their order of emergence during evolution.

This study describes the mechanism by which carvacrol regulates alveolar bone osteoblasts in periodontal disease.

MethodsA rat model of periodontal disease (P group) was created by ligating the first molar and injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Additionally, a control model (C group) was created. The treatment models received low (L group), medium (M group), and high (H group) doses of carvacrol hydrogel. In vitro, rat osteoblast cells were divided into the C, P, L, M, H, and carvacrol + LY294002 (Car+LY group) groups. Immunohistochemical staining analyzed collagen type I and runt-related transcription factor 2 expressions. Western blot analysis detected the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3{beta}) pathway-related and osteoblastic proteins. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction measured the expression of inflammatory factors and osteoblastic proteins.

ResultsCarvacrol hydrogel alleviated periodontal symptoms, upregulated PI3K/AKT/GSK-3{beta} pathway-related and osteoblastic proteins, and increased ALP expression and calcified nodules. However, it decreased cell apoptosis and inflammatory factors. LY294002 inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway and decreased osteoblastic protein expression, ALP coloration, and calcified nodules.

Even before we evaluate options, we must decide how much attentional effort to invest in the evaluation process. More precise evaluation will improve choice accuracy, and thus reward yield, but the gain may not justify the cost. Rational Inattention theories provide an accounting of the internal economics of attentionally effortful economic decisions. To understand this process, we examined choices and neural activity in several brain regions in six macaques making risky choices. We extended the rational inattention framework to incorporate the foraging theoretic understanding of local environmental richness or reward rate, which we predict will promote attentional effort. Consistent with this idea, we found local reward rate positively predicted choice accuracy. Supporting the hypothesis that this effect reflects variations in attentional effort, richer contexts were associated with increased baseline and evoked pupil size. Neural populations likewise showed systematic baseline coding of reward rate context. During increased reward rate contexts, ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex showed both an increase in value decodability and a rotation in the population geometries for value. This confluence of these results suggests a mechanism of attentional effort that operates by controlling gain through using partially distinct population codes for value. Additionally, increased reward rate accelerated value code dynamics, which have been linked to improved signal-to-noise. These results extend the theory of rational inattention to static and stationary contexts and align theories of rational inattention with specific costly, neural processes.",NA,biorxiv

Synaptic loss is associated with excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, amyloid-{beta}, and tau pathology, but the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. There is an urgent need to identify new targets to modify the disease and slow synaptic loss and cognitive decline. This study examines if calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is implicated in AD synaptic loss. cPLA2 catalyzes membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid, which can be metabolized into inflammatory eicosanoids.

MethodscPLA2 levels were examined in synaptosomes isolated from the postmortem frontal cortex of individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia from the Religious Orders Study (ROS). Eicosanoids in synaptosomes were analyzed using lipidomics. Immunofluorescent staining investigated cPLA2 interactions with synaptic markers. Human iPSCs-derived neurons were used to study cPLA2 overactivation after exposure to amyloid-{beta} 42 oligomers (A{beta}42O), its relationships with synaptic markers, and the effects of cPLA2 inhibitors.

ResultsWe observed elevated cPLA2 (cPLA2 and cPLA2{beta}) in AD synaptosomes and positive correlations with postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and cognitive dysfunction. Eicosanoids were increased in AD synaptosomes and correlated with cPLA2, indicating cPLA2 activity at synapses/synaptosomes. Phosphorylated cPLA2 (p-cPLA2) colocalized with PSD-95 in synaptosomes, and with postsynaptic Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and dendritic microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in NCI and AD brains, where their levels were reduced in AD. P-cPLA2 colocalizes with MAP2 at the neuronal soma associated with neuritic plaques and neurodegeneration in AD. A{beta}42O activates cPLA2 in human iPSCs-derived neurons, leading to p-cPLA2 relocation from the cytosol to synaptic and dendritic sites to colocalize with CaMKII and MAP2, resulting in their reduction. P-cPLA2 also colocalized with PSD-95 in A{beta}42O-exposed neurons, accompanied with increased PSD-95 intensity at soma membrane. These processes were reversed by the cPLA2 inhibitor ASB14780.

ConclusionscPLA2 overactivation at synapses, dendrites, and excitatory neuronal somas is associated with synaptic loss, neuritic plaques and neurodegeneration, potentially contributing to cognitive decline in AD. Future research needs to explore the role of cPLA2 as a disease-modifying target for AD.",NA,biorxiv

However, floral cues are not always reliable, as flowers of different plant species often differ in terms of the qualities of their food rewards, even when flower types resemble each other. At the same time, some non-floral traits, such as leaf shape, differ reliably among plant species and might be associatively learned by bees to improve foraging success. In this laboratory study, we tested whether generalist bees (Bombus impatiens) can (1) associatively learn differences in leaf shape to discriminate rewarding from unrewarding flowers and (2) rely more on differences in leaf shape when a flower color cue is harder to discriminate. We therefore assigned bees to either of two treatments: in one treatment, rewarding and unrewarding artificial targets ( flowers) differed greatly in petal color, and in the other treatment, they differed little; each treatments targets differed in leaf shape in the same way. As expected, bees learned significantly faster when flower petal colors were more dissimilar and thus relatively easier to discriminate. These bees also learned and recalled the correct combination of petal color and leaf shape. Yet when petal colors differed relatively little, bees had a much harder time learning petal color and did not show evidence of having remembered leaf shape. Our results demonstrate that leaf shape is a cue that foraging bees can learn to associate with a pollen food reward. However, leaf shape may be learned secondarily to, or only in combination with floral cues (such as petal color). We discuss evidence of compound learning and overshadowing and implications of our results for pollinator-mediated selection on non-floral plant traits.",NA,biorxiv

We previously showed that these enzymes evolve by grafting and pruning of cytochrome c modules. Here, we extended our analysis and found that grafting can also involve the incorporation of domains of other protein families and of small peptide sequences that affect the heme coordination environment. We show that the addition of hemes to multiheme cytochromes c occurs exclusively by integrating heme-binding peptides and that gain of hemes is equally probable along the protein sequence. By contrast, heme loss occurs by the loss of heme-binding peptides and the accumulation of point mutations. Notably, heme-binding motif loss is disproportionately more prevalent at the position nearer to the N-terminus. This observation contrasts with the general trend observed in proteins, which are usually more conserved at the N-terminus, and likely reflects the way in which multiheme cytochromes c are assembled. Overall, this work completes the picture of how multiheme cytochromes c evolved to achieve the diversity of structures and functions found in nature, and sets them apart from other proteins with respect to the drivers for their evolution.

These knowledge gaps hamper efforts to forecast future conditions and develop appropriate management strategies accurately. The complexity of these multi-species fisheries, combined with data scarcity for many target species, creates substantial barriers to quantifying and addressing climate vulnerability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative by leveraging available data to identify patterns and project trends despite these limitations, providing valuable insights for fisheries management in data-poor contexts. Here, we apply a Mixture of Expert, a deep learning forecasting models for small-scale, multi-specific fisheries in the Gulf of California under future climate change scenarios. Results show varied responses across marine habitats, with reef and benthic fish projected to experience substantial declines (-12.46% and -9.37%) during the 2050s-2060s, followed by recovery in the 2070s-2080s. Economic implications are significant, with reef fish facing projected losses of $1.2 million by the 2050s before recovering by the 2080s. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was applied to evaluate the importance of features for each predictive model, the analysis revealed the effects of the temperature in different depths for each fishery, and the sensitive analysis pointed to the magnitude of the effect. Our findings suggest that climate impacts will not be uniform across the Gulf, necessitating region-specific management approaches and highlighting the value of maintaining diverse fishing portfolios to enhance resilience against climate-driven changes.",NA,biorxiv

Nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments showed that H3 tails remain dynamically mobile within condensates, and their mobility correlates with condensate viscosity. These results demonstrate that the number, identity, and spatial arrangement of basic residues in the H3 tail critically regulate nucleosome phase separation.

We show that catalytic efficiency of D2HG production is greater in IDH1 R132Q than R132H mutants, and expression of R132Q in cellular and xenograft models leads to higher D2HG concentrations in cells, tumors, and sera compared to R132H.

Transcriptome analysis shows increased expression of many pro-tumor pathways upon expression of IDH1 R132Q versus R132H, including transcripts of EGFR and PI3K signaling pathways.

Traditional methods based on sequence homology and statistical models often struggle with complex genetic variations and novel sequences due to their limited ability to interpret the ""language of genes."" To overcome these challenges, we explore Genomic Language Models (gLMs) --inspired by Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing-- to enhance bacterial gene prediction. These models learn patterns and contextual dependencies within genetic sequences, similar to how LLMs process human language. We employ transformers, specifically DNABERT, for bacterial gene prediction using a two-stage framework: first, identifying Coding Sequence (CDS) regions, and then refining predictions by identifying the correct Translation Initiation Sites (TIS). DNABERT is fine-tuned on a curated set of NCBI complete bacterial genomes using a k-mer tokenizer for sequence processing. Our results show that GeneLM significantly improves gene prediction accuracy. Compared to Prodigal, a leading prokaryotic gene finder, GeneLM reduces missed CDS predictions while increasing matched annotations. More notably, our TIS predictions surpass traditional methods when tested against experimentally verified sites. GeneLM demonstrates the power of gLMs in decoding genetic information, achieving state-of-the-art performance in bacterial genome analysis.

However, less is known about the degree of heterogeneity in the HSCs response to inflammation at the single cell level. Here, using a natural murine malaria model and an NHS-ester biotin dilution assay we identify two subsets of HSCs, BiotinLo and BiotinHi, with distinct proliferation kinetics. Using combined functional, single-cell transcriptomics and phenotypic analyses, we uncover that BiotinHi HSCs remain highly functional despite expressing strong interferon response signatures. These infection-resistant HSCs express high levels of MHC II and are metabolically distinct from the remaining HSCs as they maintain less active mitochondria.

It achieves an unprecedented control through intricately orchestrated contractions of a wide variety of muscle architectures. Fascinated by the elephant trunks unique performance, scientists of all disciplines are studying its anatomy, function, and mechanics, and use it as an inspiration for biomimetic soft robots. Yet, to date, there is no precise mapping between microstructural muscular activity and macrostructural trunk motion, and our understanding of the elephant trunk remains incomplete. Specifically, no model of the elephant trunk employs formal physics-based arguments that account for its complex muscular architecture, while preserving low computational cost, to enable fast screening of its configuration space. Here we create a reduced-order model of the elephant trunk that can-within a fraction of a second- predict the trunks motion as a result of its muscular activity. To ensure reliable results in the finite deformation regime, we integrate first principles of continuum mechanics and the theory of morphoelasticity for fibrillar activation. We employ dimensional reduction to represent the trunk as an active slender structure, which results in closed-form expressions for its curvatures and extension as functions of muscle activation and anatomy. We create a high-resolution digital representation of the trunk from magnetic resonance images to quantify the effects of different muscle groups. We propose a general solution method for the inverse motion problem and apply it to extract the muscular activations of three representative trunk motions: picking a fruit; lifting a log; and lifting a log asymmetrically. For each task, we identify key features in the muscle activation profiles. Our results suggest that, upon reaching maximum contraction in select muscle groups, the elephant trunk autonomously reorganizes muscle activation to perform specific tasks. Our study provides a complete quantitative characterization of the fundamental science behind elephant trunk biomechanics, with potential applications in the material science of flexible structures, the design of soft robots, and the creation of flexible prosthesis and assist devices.",NA,biorxiv

Indirect BDQ-MIC results from TLA were compared to the established 7H11 solid DST. Direct-TLA-DST performance was assessed using 143 baseline sputum samples from rifampicin-resistant TB cases. Direct-TLA tested susceptibility to rifampicin, isoniazid, levofloxacin, and BDQ, with results compared to Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) and MGIT.

For indirect BDQ-MIC determination, TLA demonstrated high accuracy, with MIC values for H37Rv falling within the WHO control range (0.015-0.12g/ml). The incubation conditions (5-10% CO2, standard) and reading time (day 7, 14) significantly affected results, with D7 readings in standard incubator providing optimal accuracy. Direct-TLA-DST detected MTB in 53.8% of samples, compared to 55.9% on LJ and 69.4% in MGIT. Uninterpretable results due to contamination or medium drying were low (4.9%). Median time to result was 15 days for smear-positive and 22 days for smear-negative samples, faster than WHO endorsed methods. Sensitivity was 100% for rifampicin and 87.8% for isoniazid, with a specificity of 100% for all drugs except isoniazid (96.2%). No BDQ nor levofloxacin resistance was detected, thus direct TLA sensitivity could not be assessed.

In conclusion, direct-TLA-DST offers a reliable and faster alternative to conventional DST methods for BDQ and other anti-TB drugs. Essentially, this technique can be operated at BioSafety Level 2, allowing decentralization of pDST for managing drug-resistant TB in settings with limited laboratory infrastructure.

ImportanceThis paper addresses the critical need for faster direct drug-susceptibility testing (DST) on sputum, especially for bedaquiline (BDQ), which is a key drug in treating drug-resistant TB. Currently, there is a lack of rapid, reliable methods for direct BDQ testing from sputum samples, limiting timely and accurate treatment decisions and monitoring. By demonstrating the potential of thin-layer agar (TLA) for direct BDQ-MIC determination, this study offers a promising solution that could significantly improve patient care.",NA,biorxiv

We show that IL34 is upregulated in the second week of postnatal life and is expressed primarily in excitatory neurons. Excitatory-neuron specific knock-out of IL34 reduced microglia number and TMEM119 expression and increased aberrant microglial phagocytosis of excitatory thalamocortical synapses in the ACC. Acute, low dose blocking of IL34 at postnatal day 15 similarly decreased TMEM119 and inappropriately increased microglial phagocytosis of synapses.

We here derive a viable mechanism for ictogenesis driven by h- and m-channel overexpression from analysis of an in silico spiking neuronal microcircuit exhibiting spontaneous seizure-like events (SLEs). Such SLEs are dependent upon sufficiently strong gain in two adaptation terms phenomenologically modeling these channels effects: voltage homeostasis (h-current) and spike-frequency adaptation (m-current). Excessive gain of these adaptation terms interferes with the circuits processing of highly correlated input, promoting a sequence of network-level events that collectively provoke an SLE. Importantly, these changes do not cause increased excitability in isolated neurons, nor does this cascade require a change in the amplitude of external input to the circuit, suggesting an ictogenic pathway independent of classical changes to the E-I balance. The viability of this mechanism for SLE onset is strengthened by the host of experimentally-characterized features of seizure produced in this model reliant upon the presence of these adaptation terms, including the irregular initiation and termination of seizure-like events and time-varying peak frequency of oscillations during such events (i.e., chirps). Moreover, the cell-type dependent effects of changes in these adaptation terms, as delineated in our analyses, represent experimentally-testable predictions for future study of h- and m-channelopathies.

Emphasizing the crucial links between diet, oxidative stress, and cognitive health, the research underscores the essential role of quality sleep in maintaining cognitive function. The bidirectional relationship between disrupted sleep and cognitive health, as well as the impact of caffeine on cognitive function, is explored. The study involved adult male Wistar rats divided into 10 groups A - J based on cage conditions and diet. Group A-E were kept in a normal cage with diets containing varying levels of tryptophan and other essential amino acids, while Group F-J underwent sleep deprivation using a disk-over-water method and received diets with varying tryptophan and other essential amino acid levels, in addition to caffeine. The experiment spanned 2 weeks, blood samples were collected on days 1,4,7, and 13 for relevant biochemical serum analyses, and the rats were sacrificed on the fourteenth day for blood sample collection, biochemical assays, and brain histology. The 2-week experiment revealed a linear decrease in melatonin and serotonin levels across all caffeine-administered groups, possibly due to stress and anxiety as compared with the reduction in these parameters observed in control rats, suggesting melatonin and serotonin as potential sleep deprivation biomarkers. Testosterone and insulin-like growth hormone assays showed a significant decrease in sleep-deprived rats with caffeine, impacting secondary sex characteristics and growth. Elevated TNF- and interleukin-1b levels in the caffeine-administered, sleep-deprived group suggest potential health risks associated with sleep deprivation and caffeine. Serum assays for antioxidant enzymes indicated heightened oxidative stress in sleep-deprived rats with caffeine. Histopathological studies revealed cellular abnormalities in the sleep-deprived group, indicating increased cellular metabolism and potential pathological conditions. This study elucidates the complex relationships among sleep, dietary factors, and hormonal and inflammatory responses. It underscores the potential neurotoxic effects associated with caffeine consumption when coupled with sleep deprivation. These results underscore the urgent need for further investigation into dietary strategies that could alleviate these adverse effects and promote better health.",NA,biorxiv

We identified the Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (DC3000) polymutant D36E, which lacks 36 known T3SS effectors (T3Es), as a promising T3SS-dependent effector delivery system for spinach. Unlike DC3000, which causes necrotic symptoms on spinach and reaches high bacterial titres, D36E did not proliferate and caused no visible symptoms. Using D36E, we screened 28 DC3000 T3Es in spinach, assessing symptom development, bacterial proliferation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursts as a proxy for early immune responses.

MethodsAll V. mimicus genomes from Genbank were retrieved and the virulome was searched with Abricate using the VFDB database. Genomic islands (GIs) and integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) were identified using IslandViewer and ICEberg, respectively.

ResultsFive ctx-negative V. mimicus genomes carrying the Type III Secretion System 2 (T3SS2) and the TDH/TRH toxin from Vibrio parahaemolyticus were identified. The T3SS-positive genomes presented the phylotypes T3SS2 and T3SS2{beta} and formed two clusters and one singleton throughout the V. mimicus phylogeny. Genomes carrying T3SS2 and T3SS2{beta} were associated with the tdh and trh genes, respectively. Furthermore, genomic analyses characterized an integrative conjugative element (ICE) with a size of [~]150 kb carrying both V. parahaemolyticus virulence determinants.

ConclusionsIn addition to looking for cholera toxin genes in V. mimicus cases/outbreaks, it is important to consider V. parahaemolyticus toxins such as TDH and TRH. Furthermore, an ICE was identified and characterized in V. mimicus, being associated with T3SS2 and the TDH toxin, which is worrying, as it can disseminate these virulence factors among Vibrio spp.",NA,biorxiv

Despite recent mechanistic advances, the evolutionary origins of many antiphage immune systems remain elusive, especially for those that encode homologs of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) superfamily, which are essential for chromosome maintenance and DNA repair across domains of life. Here, we elucidate the structural basis and evolutionary emergence of Lamassu, a bacterial immune system family featuring diverse effectors but a core conserved SMC-like sensor. Using cryo-EM, we determined structures of the Vibrio cholerae Lamassu complex in both apo- and dsDNA-bound states, revealing unexpected stoichiometry and topological architectures. We further demonstrate how Lamassu specifically senses dsDNA in vitro and phage replication origins in vivo, thereby triggering the formation of LmuA tetramers that activate the Cap4 nuclease domain. Our findings reveal that Lamassu evolved via exaptation of the bacterial Rad50-Mre11 DNA repair system to form a compact, modular sensor for viral replication, exemplifying how cellular machinery can be co-opted for novel immune functions.",NA,biorxiv

O-Glucose glycans are added to serine residues located between the first and second conserved cysteines within the epidermal growth factor (EGF) -like repeats in the Notch extracellular domain. Previously, O-glucose glycans were shown to be extended to a trisaccharide structure with two xyloses via an 1-3 linkage. Our recent studies, however, indicated that the O-glucose glycan on NOTCH1 EGF10 can be extended by hexose and Neu5Ac. Here, we demonstrated that this hexose- and Neu5Ac-extended glycan has a 3-sialyllactose-like structure synthesized by specific members of two isoenzyme families, B4GALT1 and ST3GAL4. Using mass spectrometry, we identified this modification exclusively on NOTCH1 EGF10 and NOTCH3 EGF9 (equivalent to NOTCH1 EGF10), with no detection in any other EGF domains in NOTCH1-3. Sequence comparison and mutagenesis experiments identified one amino acid at position -2 of the fourth cysteine in the EGF domain as crucial for the galactose elongation of O-glucose glycans. We further demonstrated that this site-specific elongation of O-glucose on NOTCH1 EGF10 significantly impact ligand binding and signal transduction of NOTCH1. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the intricate regulatory mechanisms of Notch receptor function mediated by distinct positions and structures of O-glycans.

Significance StatementNotch, a signaling receptor critical for development, differentiation, and homeostasis in multicellular organisms, undergoes multiple post-translational glycan modifications to regulate its function. While O-glucose glycan elongation by xylose was previously known, we identified an O-glucose glycan extended by galactose and Neu5Ac on specific epidermal growth factor (EGF) -like repeats of certain Notch paralogs, NOTCH1 and NOTCH3. As far as we know, this structure has not been reported on any other proteins. We identify the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of this glycan and demonstrate that modifications at a specific site on Notch direct receptor functions, including ligand binding and Notch signaling.",NA,biorxiv

Hence, there is a need to leverage the knowledge of disease pathogenesis and treatment from the wider disease landscape to understand rare disease mechanisms. Furthermore, it is well understood that rare disease discoveries can inform the our knowledge of common diseases. In this paper, we introduce Dis2Vec (Disease to Vector), a new representation learning method for characterizing diseases with a focus on learning the underlying biological mechanisms, which is a step toward developing a foundation model for disease-association learning. Dis2Vec is trained on human genetic evidence and observed symptoms, and then evaluated through cross-modal transfer-learning scenarios based on a proposed drug association learning benchmark with drug targets (positive controls) and Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (negative controls). Finally, we argue that clustering diseases in the Dis2Vec space, which captures biological mechanisms instead of drug-repurposing information, could increase the efficiency of translational research in rare and common diseases, and ultimately improve treatment strategies for patients.",NA,biorxiv

Yet, diversity patterns emerging from ROAs have received relatively little attention from biogeographers, even though characterizing the effect of key geo-environmental factors on island clades species distribution could be important for unraveling diversification dynamics. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis using island-specific species richness values for approximately one hundred ROAs across major oceanic archipelagos (mostly Hawaii, Canary Islands, Galapagos and Fiji) and taxa (vascular plants, invertebrates and vertebrates). Our aim was to determine whether (1) ROA species richness patterns scale as a function of key geo-environmental factors including island area, geological age, environmental heterogeneity (elevation and topographic complexity) and inter-island isolation, and (2) whether the magnitude of the effects of these factors varies across archipelagos and taxa. Our results identified elevation as a key driver of ROA species richness patterns on islands, supporting existing theoretical and empirical work that highlighted the central role of environmental heterogeneity in driving diversification on oceanic islands. As importantly, we found that the influence of geo-environmental factors varies across archipelagos and taxa, suggesting that unique archipelagic dynamics and biological traits together shape diversification differently. Our findings emphasize the value of applying biogeographical modeling at resolution of individual radiations to improve our understanding of evolutionary processes on oceanic archipelagos.",NA,biorxiv

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane proteins whose surface expression and extracellular activation make them desirable drug targets. Our previous studies have identified 144 GPCR genes to be expressed in primary human osteoclasts, which could provide novel drug targets. The development of high-throughput assays to assess osteoclast activity would improve the efficiency at which we could assess the effect of GPCR activation on human bone cells and could be utilised for future compound screening. Here we assessed the utility of a high-content imaging (HCI) assay that measured cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFATc1), a transcription factor that is essential for osteoclast differentiation and resorptive activity. We first demonstrated that the HCI assay detected changes in NFATc1 nuclear translocation in human primary osteoclasts using GIPR as a positive control, then developed an automated analysis platform to assess NFATc1 in nuclei in an efficient and unbiased manner. We assessed six GPCRs simultaneously and identified four receptors (FFAR2, FFAR4, FPR1, GPR35) that reduced osteoclast activity. Bone resorption assays and measurements of TRAP activity verified that activation of these GPCRs reduced osteoclast activity, and that receptor-specific antagonists prevented these effects. These studies demonstrate that HCI of NFATc1 can accurately assess osteoclast activity in human cells, reducing observer bias and increasing efficiency of target detection for future osteoclast-targeted osteoporosis therapies.",10.1530/JME-24-0143,biorxiv

In this study, we introduce Relative Phase Analysis (RPA), a method that leverages phase-lead/lag relationships to reveal the real-time dynamics of dominant directional patterns and their rapid transitions. We demonstrate that the human brain switches on a sub-second timescale between a top-down mode-where anterior regions drive posterior activity-and a bottom-up mode, characterized by reverse directionality. These dynamics are most pronounced during full consciousness and gradually become less distinct as awareness diminishes. Furthermore, we find from simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings that the top-down mode is expressed when higher-order cognitive networks are more active while the bottom-up mode is expressed when sensory systems are more active. Moreover, comparisons of an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) inattentive cohort with typically developing individuals reveal distinct imbalances in these transition dynamics, highlighting the potential of RPA as a diagnostic biomarker. Complementing our empirical findings, a coupled-oscillator model of the structural brain network recapitulates these emergent patterns, suggesting that such directional modes and transitions may arise naturally from inter-regional neural interactions. Altogether, this study provides a framework for understanding whole-brain dynamics in real-time and identifies sub-second fluctuations in top-down versus bottom-up directionality as a fundamental mechanism underlying human information processing.",NA,biorxiv

The effector protein AVR3a, from P. infestans, and its homologue AVR3a11 from P. capsici, are examples of host-translocated effectors that interact with plant proteins to evade defence mechanisms and enable infection. Both proteins belong to the family of RXLR effectors and contain an N-terminal secretion signal, an RXLR motif for translocation into the host cell, and a C-terminal effector domain. Within this family, a large number of proteins have been predicted to contain one or more WY domains as their effector domain, and this domain is proposed to encompass a conserved minimal core fold containing three helices, further stabilised by additional helices or dimerization. In AVR3a11, a helical N-terminal extension to the core fold forms a four-helix bundle, as determined by X-ray crystallography. For a complete picture of the dynamics of AVR3a11, we have determined the solution structure of AVR3a11, and studied its dynamics in the fast timescale (ns-ps, from NMR relaxation parameters) and in the slow timescale (seconds to minutes, from hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments). Hydrogen/deuterium exchange showed that the N-terminal helix is less stable than the other three helices, confirming the core fold originally proposed. Relaxation measurements confirm that AVR3a11 undergoes extensive conformational exchange, despite the uniform presence of fast motions in the spectral density function throughout most of its sequence. As functional residues are located in the more mobile regions, this flexibility in the slow/intermediate timescale may be functionally important.

Lay SummaryThe effector protein AVR3a11, from the plant pathogen Phytophthora capsici, shows conformational flexibility in solution, particularly in the N-terminal helix, and in an intermediate timescale (ms-s).

We previously showed that deletion of ER protects against intestinal damage selectively in female mice; however, the mechanisms conferring sex-specific protection are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to compare ER- and ER{beta}-specific mechanisms contributing to intestinal epithelial function in males and females.

MethodsExpression of ER, ER{beta}, and GPER1 was evaluated in colonocytes from wild-type (WT) male and female mice. Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific ER and ER{beta} knockout mice were developed and challenged with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Colonic organoids were used to identify estrogen-dependent and -independent effects on cellular growth, differentiation, and transcriptional regulation in WT, ER-KO, and ER{beta}-KO IECs.

ResultsColonic IECs showed significant expression of ER, ER{beta}, and GPER1 as well as Cyp19A1, which catalyzes production of 17{beta}-estradiol (estrogen). Female mice lacking ER specifically in colonic IECs showed protection from DSS-induced injury, whereas males showed increased pathology. Organoids derived from male ER-KO mice showed enhanced proliferation and decreased expression of key functional genes even without exogenous estrogen; however, colonoids derived from female ER-KO mice transcriptional analysis showed a protective gene signature. These findings reveal that deletion of ER differentially contributes to enhanced barrier function and resistance to inflammation in females, but to dysfunctional hyper-proliferation in males.

Detecting this signal across diverse taxa can reveal broad evolutionary mechanisms that may not be apparent when studying individual lineages. In this study, we search for convergent substitutions in the most speciose group of vertebrates, teleost fishes. Using an unsupervised approach, we detected convergence in 89 protein-coding genes across 143 chromosomal-level genomes. To assess their functional implications, we integrate data on protein properties, gene expression across species and tissues, single-cell RNA sequencing of zebrafish embryonic development, and gene perturbation experiments in zebrafish. The convergent genes were associated with diverse processes including embryonic development, tissue morphogenesis, metabolism, and responses to hormones and heat stress. The convergent substitutions altered amino acid properties, with some occurring at functionally critical sites. Notably, only one-third of these genes were tissue-specific, while the majority were expressed across multiple tissues and cell types. Genetic perturbation data further showed that the convergent genes can affect multiple structures across diverse tissues. These results highlight the pleiotropic nature of the convergent genes. Using an evolutionary modeling approach, we show that adaptive variation tends to accumulate in genes with intermediate pleiotropy, enabling organisms to overcome selective pressures during ecological shifts. Although traditionally considered a source of constraint, we argue that adaptation via genes with intermediate pleiotropy might be particularly advantageous following periods of ecological shifts, and can potentially lead to the evolution of convergent phenotypes.",NA,biorxiv

Previous results demonstrate that when visual inputs are organized coherently across space and time, they are more strongly encoded in feedback-related alpha rhythms, and less strongly in feedforward-related gamma rhythms. Here, we tested whether this representational shift from feedforward to feedback rhythms is linked to the phenomenological experience of coherence. In an EEG study, we manipulated the degree of spatiotemporal coherence by presenting two segments from the same video across visual hemifields, either synchronously or asynchronously (with a delay between segments). We asked participants whether they perceived the stimulus as coherent or incoherent. When stimuli were presented at the perceptual threshold (i.e., when the same stimulus was judged as coherent 50% of times), perception co-varied with stimulus coding across alpha and gamma rhythms: When stimuli were perceived as coherent, they were represented in alpha activity; when stimuli were perceived as incoherent, they were represented in gamma activity. Whether the same visual input is perceived as coherent or incoherent thus depends on representational shifts between feedback-related alpha and feedforward-related gamma rhythms.",NA,biorxiv

The evolved populations demonstrated increased metal surface tolerance without concurrent increase in MBC and MIC values of respective metal ions or selected antibiotics. Mutation analysis did not detect increased mutation accumulation nor mutations in cop, cus, cue, sil, pco or general efflux genes known to actively maintain copper/silver homeostasis. Instead, during cyclic exposure mutations in genes related to cellular barrier functions and sulfur metabolism were enriched potentially suggesting that reducing bioavailability and passively restricting uptake of the toxic metals rather than active efflux is selected for on copper and silver surfaces. The changes detected in the evolved populations did not indicate an increased risk of antibiotic cross-resistance as a result of copper or silver surface exposure. However, rapid emergence of mutations in silS activated the cryptic sil efflux locus during silver ion challenge in liquid MBC assay with the evolved populations. The silS mutants showed no benefit on copper and silver surfaces but demonstrated decreased sensitivity to ampicillin and ciprofloxacin as well as copper and silver ions in liquid tests indicating that efflux might be specific to granting heavy metal tolerance in liquid but not surface exposure format. Our findings highlight the critical importance of appropriate exposure conditions not only in efficacy assessment but also risk assessment of antimicrobial surface applications.

ImportanceThis study examines the evolutionary adaptations of Escherichia coli after semi-dry exposure to copper and silver surfaces, leading to an increase in surface tolerance but no increase in mutation accumulation or substantially enhanced metal ion tolerance in standard tests. Notably, enriched mutations indicate a shift toward more energy-passive mechanisms of metal tolerance. Additionally, while enhanced silver efflux was rapidly selected for in a single round of silver exposure in liquid tests and substantially increased copper and silver ion tolerance in conventional test formats, the causal mutations did not improve viability on silver and copper surfaces, underscoring the different fitness scenarios of tolerance mechanisms dependent on exposure conditions. These findings emphasize the need for appropriate exposure conditions in evaluating of both efficacy and the potential risks of using antimicrobial surfaces, as the results from conventional liquid-based tests may not apply in solid contexts.",NA,biorxiv

Leveraging two EEG datasets of images presented at different durations, we assessed whether this correspondence reflects general architectural principles or model-specific computations. Our analysis revealed a robust mapping: early EEG components correlated with activations from initial network layers and low-level visual features, whereas later components aligned with deeper layers and semantic content. Moreover, for images presented during longer times, the extent of correspondence correlated with the semantic contribution to the EEG response. These findings highlight a consistent temporal alignment between biological and artificial vision, suggesting that this correspondence is primarily driven by the hierarchical transformation of visual to semantic representations rather than by idiosyncratic computational features of individual network architectures.",NA,biorxiv

Based on analyses at base-pair resolution, we demonstrate a close correlation between binding of regulatory proteins, formation of chromatin interactions, and gene expression. Integration of single-allele topologies and computational modeling shows that tissue-specific gene loci are organized into chromatin hubs, characterized by cooperative interactions between multiple enhancers, promoters, and CTCF-binding sites. Depletion of CTCF strongly impairs the formation of these structures, but has mild effects on gene expression, which can be explained by rewired enhancer-promoter interactions. This demonstrates an instructive role for enhancer-promoter interactions in gene regulation that is independent of cooperative interactions in chromatin hubs.

This process generates a dynamic balance between elongation and shortening, best represented by a steady-state telomere length (TL) distribution. We developed a computational pipeline for detecting telomeric sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome directly from raw Oxford Nanopore reads. This method provides a complete view of TL distributions and enables broad exploration of TL diversity, as it is directly applicable to any high-throughput single-molecule sequencing dataset without prior DNA preparation. We analyzed the TL distribution in 100 S. cerevisiae strains representing the genetic and ecological diversity of the species. We obtained the first species-level view of TL distributions at individual chromosome extremities and measured their mean value across all strains at 359 {+/-} 129 bp. Our analysis revealed a large diversity in TL distributions across strains, polyploids exhibiting longer telomeres than diploids and haploids. We confirmed that TL distributions are specific to each chromosome extremity and found that the extent of the inter-extremity differences within a strain varied widely across strains. Each strain displays a distinct TL distribution pattern defined by two components: inter-extremity differences in mean TL and within-extremity TL heterogeneity. Differences in inter-extremity mean TL accounted for most of the observed TL variations between strains. Furthermore, we found that inter-extremity differences partly result from the presence of subtelomeric Y elements, which are associated with longer telomeres in cis. Interestingly, despite large TL variations, the length of the shortest telomeres remained relatively constant across strains and fluctuated around 138 {+/-} 45 bp, suggesting a selective constraint at the species level. This study reveals the species-wide TL diversity in S. cerevisiae and highlights key factors shaping TL distributions at individual chromosome extremities.",NA,biorxiv

The prototypic bioactive KDM6 inhibitor GSK-J4 induces apoptotic cell death in multiple myeloma cells and corresponding transcriptomic profiles are dominated by metal and metabolic stress response signatures, also observed in primary human myeloma cells. Here we investigate the hypothesis that metal-chelation by GSK-J4 provides the means for transport and intracellular release of Zn2+ leading to a metallothionein transcriptomic response signature. Live cell imaging of myeloma cells shows transient increases in intracellular free Zn2+ concentrations when exposed to GSK-J4, consistent with a model of inhibitor-mediated metal transport. Comparisons of GSK-J4 and ZnSO4 treatments in the presence or absence of metal chelators show that both treatment conditions induce different transcription factor repertoires with an overlapping MTF1 transcriptional regulation responsible for metallothionein and metal ion transport regulation. The data provide a possible explanation for the observed metal response upon GSK-J4 inhibition however the relationship with the pro-apoptotic mechanism in myeloma cells requires further investigation.",NA,biorxiv

Here, by adopting the key bacterial division proteins MinCDE and FtsZ as an archetypal spatial patterning system, we present a simple vesicle-based in vitro model to explore the mutual dependence of protein pattern formation and membrane heterogeneity. Like many other peripheral membrane proteins, MinDE exhibit preferential binding and macro-scale pattern formation at Ld domains, which leads to altered oscillation mode selection in phase-separated membrane compartments (GUVs). Moreover, incorporating bacterial division proteins within phase-separated GUVs leads to blebbing-like membrane deformations followed by the reorganization of Lo domains aligning at the neck region of the bleb, which agrees well with the domain rearrangement in bacterial membranes immediately preceding the radial constriction process.

This project aimed to utilise metagenomics to identify AMR genes present in a companion animal hospital and compare these with phenotypic results from bacterial isolates from clinical specimens from the same veterinary hospital.

MethodsSamples were collected from sites around a primary companion animal veterinary hospital in North London. Metagenomic DNA was sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION. The sequencing data were analysed for AMR genes, plasmids and clinically relevant pathogen species. These data were compared to phenotypic speciation and antibiotic susceptibility tests (ASTs) of bacteria isolates from patients.

ResultsThe most common resistance genes identified were aph (n=101 times genes were isolated across 48 metagenomic samples), sul (84), blaCARB (63), tet (58) and blaTEM (46). In clinical isolates, a high proportion of phenotypic resistance to the {beta}-lactams was identified. Rooms with the greatest mean number of resistance genes identified per swab site were the medical preparation room, dog ward and surgical preparation room. Twenty-four Gram-positive and four enterobacterial plasmids were identified. Sequencing reads matched with 14/22 (64%) of the phenotypically isolated bacterial species.

DiscussionMetagenomics identified AMR genes, plasmids and species of relevance to human and animal medicine. Communal animal-handling areas harboured more AMR genes than areas animals did not frequent. When considering infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, adherence to, and frequency of, cleaning schedules, alongside potentially more comprehensive disinfection of animal-handling areas may reduce the number of potentially harmful bacteria present.

For cells to survive, at least some of the proteome must resume function upon rehydration. Which proteins tolerate desiccation, and the molecular determinants that underlie this tolerance, are largely unknown. Here, we apply quantitative and structural proteomic mass spectrometry to show that certain proteins possess an innate capacity to tolerate rehydration following extreme water loss. Structural analysis points to protein surface chemistry as a key determinant for desiccation tolerance, which we test by showing that rational surface mutants can convert a desiccation sensitive protein into a tolerant one. Desiccation tolerance also has strong overlap with cellular function, with highly tolerant proteins responsible for production of small molecule building blocks, and intolerant proteins involved in energy-consuming processes such as ribosome biogenesis. As a result, the rehydrated proteome is preferentially enriched with metabolite and small molecule producers and depleted of some of the cells heaviest consumers. We propose this functional bias enables cells to kickstart their metabolism and promote cell survival following desiccation and rehydration.

Birds are a well-studied model clade for this and have had complex, clade-wise colonisation and diversification pathways on tropical island archipelagos. Many such events occurred during periods of Quaternary sea-level fall resulting in many island landmasses connecting to each other and to continents, along with habitat availability changes. We reconstructed the demographic history of a panel of tropical, single-island endemics using Pairwise Sequential Markovian Coalescent (PSMC), reconstructed their habitat availability during the Last Glacial Period and Holocene, and checked for their correlations with species traits using bayesian multivariate regression models. We observed that 24 out of 28 species had an increase in habitat availability from the LIG to the LGM. From the LGM till present day, habitat decreased for 19 species. PSMC analyses revealed that most species experienced a decline in effective population size (Ne) from the LIG to the LGM, and that most species have entered the holocene with low values of genetic diversity. Diet specialists and large-bodied species showed a decrease in Ne between LIG to LGM. We also observed a strong passerine-specific signal for correlations between habitat availability and change in Ne. Our results indicate that tropical island endemics are sensitive to climatic fluctuations, their responses are dictated by species traits, and their plastic response to habitat availability could be a consequence of their ability to rapidly diversify.",NA,biorxiv

Depletion of the non-essential amino acid serine induces an intracellular shift from the generation of canonical SLs to non-canonical SLs known as deoxySLs, which can exert antitumor effects. Recent evidence has shown that restricting endogenous and exogenous sources of serine from cancer cells promotes antitumor immunity by activating the cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase-Stimulator of Interferon Genes (cGAS-STING) pathway. However, it is not known whether deoxySLs play a role in mediating this antitumor immune response. In this study, we demonstrated that depleting both externally supplied and internally synthesized serine from CT26 colon cancer cells maximally increased the levels of deoxySLs compared to removing either source alone. The ability of serine restriction to induce cytosolic accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and subsequent activation of cGAS-STING components, including downstream Type I interferons (IFNs) was prevented by blocking deoxySL generation with the serine-palmitoyl transferase (SPT) inhibitor, myriocin. Direct administration of deoxysphinganine to cells induced mitochondrial dysfunction, in association with accumulation of cytosolic mtDNA, and increased expression of cGAS-STING components and Type I IFNs. A similar increase in IFNs was observed following mutation of SPT or supplementation of WT cells with alanine. Increasing deoxySLs in tumors through SPT mutation or feeding an alanine-enriched diet suppressed tumor growth in mice, while combining SPT mutation with a high alanine diet accentuated the antitumor effects. The observed tumor growth suppression was associated with increased infiltration of activated dendritic and cytotoxic T cells. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel role for deoxySLs in mediating antitumor immunity and provide support for the potential of using diet modification as an anticancer approach.",NA,biorxiv

Plants generate short HSFs (S-HSFs) derived from HSF splicing variants, yet their functions remain poorly understood. While an enhanced canonical HSR confers thermotolerance, its hyperactivation inhibits plant growth. How plants prevent this hyperactivation to ensure proper growth remains unknown. Here, we report that Arabidopsis S-HsfA2, S-HsfA4c, and S-HsfB1 confer sensitivity to extreme heat (45 {degrees}C) and constitute new HSF types featuring a unique truncated DNA-binding domain (tDBD). This tDBD binds a new heat-regulated element (HRE), which confers minimal promoter heat-responsiveness and exhibits heat stress sensing and transmission patterns. Using S-HsfA2, we investigated whether and how S-HSFs prevent canonical HSR hyperactivation. HSP17.6B, a common direct target of HsfA2 and S-HsfA2, confers thermotolerance; however, its overexpression partially causes HSR hyperactivation. Moreover, HRE-HRE-like and HSE elements mediate the HSP17.6B promoters heat response. We further show S-HsfA2 alleviates hyperactivation via two mechanisms: 1) S-HsfA2 negatively regulates HSP17.6B via the HRE-HRE-like element, establishing a noncanonical HSR (S-HsfA2-HRE-HSP17.6B) that antagonistically represses HsfA2-activated HSP17.6B expression. 2) S-HsfA2 binds the HsfA2 DBD, preventing HsfA2 from binding HSEs and thereby attenuating HsfA2-activated HSP17.6B promoter activity.

The present study uses clinical and demographic characteristics to compare the predictive accuracy of eight machine learning models for CHD diagnosis.

MethodsWe contrasted the predictive accuracy of eight different machine learning models for CHD classification. The work identifies the most important features from the top-performing models and applies SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to gain insight into how every feature affects the models prediction. These interpretive methods assist in displaying the direction and amount of feature contributions to allow transparency in AI-based CHD risk prediction.

ResultsXGboost and Random Forest achieved the highest testing accuracies 0.839 and 0.805, with training accuracies of 0.901 and 0.957 respectively showing ideal model of XGboost and significant overfitting for random forest model. ECG-associated features, such as resting ECG and old peak (ST depression through workout), also place favorably, supporting the significance of cardiac electrical activity in diagnosis. ST slope has the highest impact, followed by Chest pain type and old peak, which increase the likelihood of heart disease with their high values contributing positively to the prediction. Resting bps, sex, and fasting blood sugar have lower impacts on the models predictions.

ConclusionsIn conclusion, machine learning models, particularly XGboost and random forest, show substantial predictive accuracy for coronary heart disease, with testing AUROCs of 0.885. Feature importance, SHAP and LIME analysis highlight the critical role of ECG-derived metrics like ST slope, chest pain type, and resting ecp while traditional risk factors such as cholesterol, resting bps, and fasting blood sugar have less influence.",NA,biorxiv

We profiled chromatin accessibility in corticospinal neurons across development and found two distinct waves of restriction: a partial closure between P0-P4 and a stronger, widespread restriction from P7 into adulthood. We next asked if injury proximity influences chromatin remodeling. Distal (thoracic) injuries caused minimal changes, but proximal (intracortical) injuries triggered broad accessibility shifts, suggesting that injury site matters for epigenetic responsiveness. Finally, we tested whether the mature chromatin landscape could be reopened using PATZ1, a developmental transcription factor. Delivering PATZ1 post-injury led to marked chromatin remodeling--an 11.6-fold increase in H3K27ac at growth genes and targeted reorganisation of 3D genome architecture, including compartment switching and altered TADs. These changes were accompanied by transcriptional reactivation of growth programs. Together, our findings pinpoint when and how growth gene chromatin becomes restricted and show that it can be reactivated in adults using targeted interventions like PATZ1.",NA,biorxiv

We also observe strong activation of TDP-43-controlled cryptic exons in cells, including human neurons treated with proteopathic seeds. Furthermore, aggregate seeding impairs TDP-43 autoregulation, an essential mechanism controlling TDP-43 homeostasis. Interestingly, proteins that normally interact with TDP-43 are not recruited to aggregates, while other factors linked to TDP-43 pathology, including Ataxin 2, specifically colocalize to inclusions and modify seeding-induced aggregation.

As mosquito larvae require microbe-derived vitamins for development, we studied whether such a support of Wolbachia would exist in mosquitoes but be masked by the presence of other microbes. We chose Culex quinquefasciatus species to address this question, as it is highly colonized with Wolbachia. We developed a method to produce Culex quinquefasciatus devoid of extracellular microbiota and demonstrated that Wolbachia alone is insufficient to support larval development. Using transient colonization with Escherichia coli, we managed to produce adult Culex quinquefasciatus harboring Wolbachia only.

To test potential regulatory levels, we analyze the CAM plant Kalanchoe laxiflora embedded in the context of available CAM genome and transcriptome sequences. We show that CAM associated transcripts and proteins do not show a binary on/off pattern between day and night in K. laxiflora. Instead, we observe that many CAM plants display shared amino acid changes compared to C3 plants especially in starch metabolism. Phosphoproteomics identifies phosphoproteome changes in K. laxiflora between day and night.

To explore trait persistence, we studied 998 Rhode Island Red purebred hens from the Novogen nucleus. We recorded daily egg production from 70 to 92 weeks of age and measured individual feed intake twice a week for three weeks, starting at 70, 80, and 90 weeks, as well as body weight at the start and at the end of each feed intake recording period. Random regression models were used to study trait trajectories over time, and PCA and hierarchical clustering were applied to identify groups of hens based on estimated breeding values for the intercept and slope of traits trajectory.

ResultsResults showed different aging trajectories among traits. Daily body weight variation, Feed conversion ratio, Haugh unit and yolk percentage showed persistence (i.e., stability) over the measured period. On the contrary, daily feed intake, residual feed intake, laying rate, egg mass, eggshell breaking strength and stiffness decreased over time, while body weight, mean egg weight and eggshell colour increased. To assess the feasibility of selecting for trait persistence, we estimated the genetic variance of the slope and its correlation with the intercept. We found that, for egg weight and eggshell colour, genetic variance of the slope was negligible, indicating that selection for persistence on these traits requires other means. On the contrary, the slope for other traits such as laying rate and residual feed intake showed significant additive genetic variance. Strong genetic correlations between trait estimates at different ages were also observed and heritabilities estimates were low to high depending of the traits and period.

ConclusionThe study explores hens trait persistence from 70 to 92 weeks, suggesting potential for improved egg production persistence. Challenges arise from low genetic variances impacting the efficiency of the potential selection on persistence. Clustering analysis reveals distinctive response patterns to elongation of production and underlined that selecting for enhanced persistence of different traits will necessitate compromises in breeding goals.",NA,biorxiv

This study is based on 23 injections placed at various cortical layers and analyzed in detail. The results reveal a striking columnar architecture of local axons organized in vertically oriented bundles as well as vertical columns of neuronal cells bodies. A high degree of specificity was observed in the connectional patterns of various layers. This specificity was reflected in the tendency of lateral connections to spread into different cortical layers, and in the large variations in the axonal bouton densities in different layers. More specifically. Layer IV injections resulted in a more circular projection pattern including massive projections into layer II-III. Layer V injections produced extensive intra-laminar lateral connections while layer VI injections resulted in a vertical projection leading up to layer IV and a lateral intra-laminar projection.

MethodsRats underwent bilateral cervical LNVA using high-magnification supermicrosurgical techniques. Following identification of the deep cervical lymph nodes, end-to-side lymph node-to-venous anastomosis was performed. Anastomotic patency was confirmed intraoperatively by direct visualization without leakage.

The dsDNA is actively packaged into procapsids, which undergo complex maturation reactions to form infectious virions. In bacteriophage P22, scaffolding protein (SP) directs the assembly of coat proteins into procapsids that have a T=7 icosahedral arrangement, en route to the formation of the mature P22 capsid. Other than the C-terminal helix-turn-helix involved in interaction with coat protein, the structure of the P22 303 amino acid scaffolding protein within the procapsid is not understood.

In addition to its well-known functions in the regulation of glycosaminoglycans integrity, accumulating evidence indicates that Hpa plays vital roles in viral infection, while the mechanisms are not yet fully understood, especially in RNA virus infection. In this study, we report that Hpa functions as a restriction factor for Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Our results demonstrated that Hpa, but not the enzymatic inactive mutant (Hpa-DM), resulted in degradation of the ZIKV envelope (E) protein, which could be rescued by treatment of the proteasome inhibitor (MG132) and the autophagy inhibitor (NH4Cl), separately. Additionally, the ubiquitination of ZIKV E did not show an significant change in the presence of Hpa. Overexpression of Hpa, but not Hpa-DM, dramatically decreased ZIKV infection in different cell models, evidenced by the reduction of viral proteins and a compromised production of infectious virions. This was further confirmed by the results in MEF cells, in which knockout Hpa enhanced ZIKV infection, while overexpression of Hpa suppressed the production of virions. In addition, ZIKV was found to downregulate the Hpa expression, which could counteract the inhibitory effects of Hpa. Altogether, our study discovers an unrecognized role of Hpa in virus infection and demonstrates that Hpa serves as a restriction factor for ZIKV infection.

SummaryZika virus (ZIKV), primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, can cause a wide range of symptoms, including myalgia, fever, rash, and severe neurological complications such as microcephaly, epilepsy, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. A deep understanding of ZIKV-host cell interactions, particularly the roles of pro- and anti-viral factors, is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies, which are currently unavailable. In this study, we uncover that heparanase (Hpa), the only endoglycosidase enzyme in mammalian cells capable of cleaving heparan sulfate (HS), can degrade the ZIKV envelope (E) protein. Hpa exhibits an inhibitory role in ZIKV infection in different cell models.

While high-throughput measurements of bacterial growth rates are easily performed in any microbiology lab, similar methods are lacking for bacteriophages. This gap hinders systematic comparisons of important phage phenotypes, such as their amplification rate in bacterial populations and their bactericidal effect, across different phages and environmental conditions. Here, we show that the amplification rate of lytic phages can be quantified by analyzing bacterial population growth and collapse dynamics under phage predation using a parsimonious mathematical model - an approach termed PHORCE (Phage-Host Observation for Rate estimation from Collapse Events). We found that the resulting phage amplification rate captures the bactericidal effect independent of initial phage and bacterial population sizes and across different growth conditions. Using high-throughput PHORCE, we found that the amplification rates of Escherichia coli phages vary widely by more than three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, our approach suggests that phage-antibiotic interactions are predominantly determined by the antibiotic, and not by the phage. In particular, the ribosome-inhibiting antibiotic doxycycline generally showed antagonism with phage amplification, whereas the DNA-damaging antibiotic nitrofurantoin was synergistic. This framework provides a means to quantitatively characterize phage phenotypes and may facilitate future high-throughput phage screens for antibacterial applications.",10.1371/journal.pbio.3003065,biorxiv

The ultimate goal of this process is to produce neural dynamics that enable the rich repertoire of behaviors we perform with our limbs. What begins as a series of ""babbles"" coalesces into skilled motor output as the brain rapidly learns to control the body. However, the nature of the teaching signal underlying this normative learning process remains elusive. Here, we test two well-established and biologically plausible theories--supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL)--that could explain how neural circuits develop the capacity for skilled movements. We trained recurrent neural networks to control a biomechanical model of a primate arm using either SL or RL and compared the resulting neural dynamics to populations of neurons recorded from the motor cortex of monkeys performing the same movements. Intriguingly, only RL-trained networks produced neural activity that matched their biological counterparts in terms of both the geometry and dynamics of population activity. We show that the similarity between RL-trained networks and biological brains depends critically on matching biomechanical properties of the limb. We then demonstrated that monkeys and RL-trained networks, but not SL-trained networks, show a strikingly similar capacity for robust short-term behavioral adaptation to a movement perturbation, indicating a fundamental and general commonality in the neural control policy. Together, our results support the hypothesis that neural dynamics for behavioral control emerge through a process akin to reinforcement learning. The resulting neural circuits offer numerous advantages for adaptable behavioral control over simpler and more efficient learning rules and expand our understanding of how developmental processes shape neural dynamics.",NA,biorxiv

Modeling of anti-spike T cell responses against ancestral and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that epitope immunodominance and cross-reactivity are major predictive determinants of T cell immunity.

STRUCTURED ABSTRACT

BackgroundSocial support is a potentially protective factor against substance use disorders (SUDs). Previous studies in rats have shown that when females are pair housed, they have lower motivation for drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine (METH), than females who are single housed. In males, however, socially housed and singly housed males both have the same motivation for drugs such as cocaine.

PurposeThe aim of this study was to investigate if social housing would attenuate METH self-administration in females or males when both cage mates are self-administering METH on an intermittent access schedule (IntA). The study also investigated how the quality of those relationships changed after METH self-administration, if dominance played a role in the rate of self-administration, and the extent to which the quality of the relationships was related to METH self-administration.

MethodsMale and female rats were individually housed or housed in same sex pairs from around day 42, then animals underwent self-administration of METH (0.3 mg/kg/inf) on an IntA schedule of reinforcement. Both animals in a pair self-administered METH. Social behavior was evaluated prior to and throughout the period when animals were self-administering METH.

ResultsThe results showed that in females, single housed females self-administered more METH than pair housed females, while males in both housing conditions self-administered METH at the same rate. More singly housed females on day one of the IntA had high rates of self-administration, compared to socially housed females. Differences attenuated after the first session, but singly housed females still self-administered METH to a greater extent than pair housed females overall. The social behavior data showed that females given saline spent more time apart while the females given METH spent more time together. This suggested that social behavior may contribute to the attenuation of self-administration in females. Males social behavior largely remained unchanged after METH and males continued to exhibit dominance behaviors. Furthermore, males METH self-administration was affected by dominance, with dominant males exhibiting greater responding for METH than non-dominant males.

ConclusionsSocial housing provides some protective benefits to females, but not males, for METH self-administration. Further, the type of relationship between cage mates affects males self-administration and may explain why social housing with a same sex mate is not beneficial for males.

Understanding of circadian coordination of CAM remains limited to rhythmic post-translational regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC) by a specific clock-controlled protein kinase, PPCK. Here, candidate promoter regions ([~]3000 bp) of CAM-associated genes from Kalanchoe laxiflora were coupled to a firefly luciferase reporter and stable transgenic lines of both K. laxiflora and C3 Arabidopsis thaliana were generated. In K. laxiflora, the CAM-associated GLUCOSE 6-PHOSPHATE/PHOSPHATE TRANSLOCATOR2 promoter (KlGPT2p) generated robust circadian rhythms of luciferase luminescence in constant conditions, with peak activity in leaf pair 3, where CAM-associated nocturnal CO2 fixation initiated during leaf development. KlGPT2p::LUC+ did not drive rhythms of luminescence in A. thaliana and the KlPPCK1 promoter produced no LUC+ signal in either species. Furthermore, the CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN2 promoter (KlCAB2p), a clock-controlled promoter that drives a gene involved in light-reactions of photosynthesis, drove robust rhythms in both K. laxiflora and A. thaliana. KlCAB2p circadian period changed during leaf development in K. laxiflora, revealing differing control by the core-clock during development. KlCAB2p peak activity shifted to dawn in A. thaliana relative to a dusk phased peak in CAM leaves of K. laxiflora, highlighting differences in the timing of outputs from the core clock between species. These findings establish a robust PROMOTER::LUC+ reporter system in a CAM plant and highlight divergent timing driving clock controlled promoters between species, and period lengthening with leaf age in Kalanchoe.

We found that GVIN1 proteins form a coatomer around cytosolic bacteria and prevent Burkholderia from establishing force-generating actin comet tails. Coatomers formed by a second IFN{gamma}-inducible GTPase, human guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1), constitute a GVIN1-independent but mechanistically related anti-motility pathway. We show that coating with either GVIN1 or GBP1 displaces the Burkholderia outer membrane protein BimA, an actin nucleator that is essential for actin tail formation.

Recent structural studies of KATP channels employing cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) have revealed a promiscuous pocket where several known KATP pharmacochaperones bind. The structural knowledge provides a framework for discovering KATP channel pharmacochaperones with desired reversible inhibitory effects to permit functional recovery of rescued channels. Using an AI-based virtual screening technology AtomNet(R) followed by functional validation, we identified a novel compound, termed Aekatperone, which exhibits chaperoning effects on KATP channel trafficking mutations.

While successful targeted therapies have been developed based on driver DNA mutations, many patient tumors lack druggable mutations and have limited treatment options. Here, we hypothesize that new precision oncology targets may be identified through ""expression-driven dependency"", whereby cancer cells with high expression of a targeted gene are more vulnerable to the knockout of that gene. We introduce a Bayesian approach, BEACON, to identify such targets by jointly analyzing global transcriptomic and proteomic profiles with genetic dependency data of cancer cell lines across 17 tissue lineages. BEACON identifies known druggable genes, e.g., BCL2, ERBB2, EGFR, ESR1, MYC, while revealing new targets confirmed by both mRNA- and protein-expression driven dependency. Notably, the identified genes show an overall 3.8-fold enrichment for approved drug targets and enrich for druggable oncology targets by 7 to 10-fold. We experimentally validate that the depletion of GRHL2, TP63, and PAX5 effectively reduce tumor cell growth and survival in their dependent cells. Overall, we present the catalog of express-driven dependency targets as a resource for identifying novel therapeutic targets in precision oncology.",NA,biorxiv

They include viruses, mitochondrial DNAs, multi-gene families etc. The paradox is that neutral evolution in two stages should be far slower than single-copy systems but the opposite is often true, thus leading to the suggestion of natural selection. We now apply the new Generalized Haldane (GH) model to quantify genetic drift in the mammalian ribosomal RNA genes (or rDNAs). On average, rDNAs have C [~] 150 - 300 copies. A neutral mutation in rDNA should take 4NC* generations to become fixed (N, the population size; C*, the effective copy number). While C > C* >> 1 is expected, the observed fixation time in mouse and human is < 4N, hence the paradox of C*< 1. Genetic drift thus appears as much as 100 times stronger for rRNA genes as for single-copy genes. The large increases in genetic drift are driven by a host of molecular mechanisms such as gene conversion and unequal crossover. Although each mechanism of drift has been extremely difficult to quantify, the GH model permits the estimation of their total effects on genetic drift. In conclusion, the GH model can be generally applicable to multi-copy gene systems without being burdened by tracking the diverse molecular mechanisms individually.",NA,biorxiv

A diversity of approaches exist for mitigating (e.g., avoiding, minimizing, or compensating for) the effects of OSW development on aerofauna (birds and bats), but little is known about the effectiveness of many of these approaches. To address this knowledge gap, we reviewed the scientific and gray literature to evaluate the evidence base for proposed mitigation approaches for OSW and aerofauna. Given limited data from the OSW sector, we included studies from other industries where relevant (e.g., terrestrial wind energy, offshore oil and gas industry, other maritime and terrestrial industries). Of a total of 211 mitigation approaches relevant to OSW that were described in 183 source documents, most approaches focused on minimization, with far fewer addressing avoidance or compensation. Sixty-one percent (128 approaches) had no evidence of being tested in the reviewed literature. Of the 83 mitigation approaches that were field tested or implemented, we found evidence of effectiveness for only 41 approaches. This included approaches tested and implemented in other industry contexts; however, specific to the OSW sector, we found evidence of effectiveness for only 10 approaches. Consequently, 86% of all the mitigation approaches identified in this review lacked any evidence of effectiveness. For birds, minimization approaches related to lighting (e.g., reducing artificial light, avoiding white and steady-burning lights) were the most tested and effective methods for reducing maladaptive attraction and collisions. For bats, minimization approaches involving adjustments to turbine operations (e.g., curtailment and feathering of turbine blades) were most tested and effective methods for reducing collisions. Given the limited evidence of effectiveness for most approaches, dedicated testing of mitigation measures is urgently needed to mitigate the environmental challenges posed by the OSW industry. Until such evidence becomes available, avoidance of effects (via careful siting of industrial activity and related measures) remains the single best available option for mitigating impacts to aerofauna. To fully address the effects of OSW development on aerofauna, compensation and offset strategies should also be further explored.",NA,biorxiv

To determine if decreased lamin B levels are due to nuclear rupture, we used immunofluorescence to measure levels of lamin B and emerin, a nuclear envelope protein that enriches to sites of nuclear rupture. We observed that cell types that exhibit decreased levels of lamin B also show an enrichment of emerin in nuclear blebs. Oppositely, in other cell types, nuclear blebs display maintained levels of lamin B1 and showed no emerin enrichment. To determine how nuclear rupture affects DNA damage, we time lapse imaged nuclear rupture dynamics then fixed the same cells to conduct immunofluorescence of {gamma}H2AX and emerin. We find that DNA damage levels are higher in blebbed nuclei independent of nuclear rupture.

The homeostatic programs oocytes use to endure long-term storage are poorly understood. Using female nematodes as a short-lived model, we found that oocyte formation and storage required IFET-1, the conserved eIF4E-Transporter protein (eIF4ET). IFET-1 co-assembled with CAR-1 (Lsm14) to form micron-scale condensates in stored oocytes, which dissipated after oocyte activation. Depletion of IFET-1 destabilized the stored oocyte proteome, leading to lower translation, a decline in microtubule maintenance proteins, and errors in microtubule organization and meiotic spindle assembly. Deleting individual domains within IFET-1 impaired oocyte storage without affecting oocyte formation. Thus, in addition to establishing a healthy oocyte reserve in young mothers, IFET-1 ensures that correct levels of cytoskeletal proteins are maintained as oocytes age. Human eIF4ET also localized to micron-scale puncta in dormant oocytes in a reproductively healthy patient. Our results clarify the role for eIF4ET in maintaining the oocyte reserve and further support eIF4ET dysfunction as an upstream cause of embryonic aneuploidy and age-related infertility.",NA,biorxiv

Larger brains facilitate the evolution of greater behavioural plasticity, which could facilitate diversification in two ways, either by driving increased speciation (behavioural drive) or by making lineages more resilient to extinction (cognitive buffer). Here, we model brain size dependent diversification dynamics from published endocranial volume data for a sample of 2291 extant and fossil bird taxa, jointly modelling speciation rate, extinction rate and fossilisation rate separately for perching birds and other groups. We find that increasing relative brain size primarily increases diversification rate through decreasing extinction rate, supporting the cognitive buffer hypothesis and suggesting that larger brains in birds promote diversification by making species more resilient to extinction. Although speciation and extinction are dependent on relative brain size in both perching birds and other groups, this dependence is non-linear. In perching birds, the highest diversification rates are found over a narrow range of relative brain sizes, in contrast to other bird groups which show lower diversification rates over a broader range of relative brain sizes.

SignificanceThe potential for speciation and extinction are thought to be shaped by key phenotypic traits. In birds, brain size is one important trait hypothesized to have an impact on diversification. Testing this hypothesis requires the evolution of brain size, speciation rate, and extinction rate to be jointly modelled across the bird phylogeny. The inclusion of information on past diversity has been shown to be important in inferring diversification patterns, and so we include not only data from a broad sample of living birds but also information from the fossil record. Our study reveals patterns of brain size dependent diversification in birds which are consistent with the cognitive buffer hypothesis, with higher relative brain sizes being associated with lower extinction rates.",NA,biorxiv

However, studying the subjective percepts of animals poses a fundamental challenge: unlike human participants, animals cannot be verbally instructed to report what they see, hear, or feel. Instead, they must be trained to perform a task for reward, and researchers must infer from their responses what the animal perceived. However, animals responses are shaped by reward feedback, thus raising the major concern that the reward regimen may alter the animals decision strategy or even their intrinsic perceptual biases. Using simulations of a reinforcement learning agent, we demonstrate that conventional reward strategies fail to allow accurate estimation of perceptual biases. We developed a method that estimates perceptual bias during task performance and then computes the reward for each trial based on the evolving estimate of the animals perceptual bias. Our approach makes use of multiple stimulus contexts to dissociate perceptual biases from decision-related biases. Starting with an informative prior, our Bayesian method updates a posterior over the perceptual bias after each trial. The prior can be specified based on data from past sessions, thus reducing the variability of the online estimates and allowing it to converge to a stable estimate over a small number of trials. After validating our method on synthetic data, we apply it to estimate perceptual biases of monkeys in a motion direction discrimination task in which varying background optic flow induces robust perceptual biases. This method overcomes an important challenge to understanding the neural basis of subjective percepts.",NA,biorxiv

To address an imminent crisis, it is essential to identify and characterize new antibacterial molecules. With that in mind, we developed the ADP-MoA platform, that facilitates the discovery of new antibiotics and provides preliminary insights into their mechanisms of action. The basic idea is to simultaneously visualize antibiotic activity - growth inhibition, along with one of the three classic antibiotics mechanisms of action: DNA damage/inhibition of DNA replication, protein synthesis inhibition and cell wall damage. The platform consists of three different chromosomal fusions between the promoters of recA, ampC or armZ and the luxCDABE operon. The platform was constructed and hitherto tested in the pathogenic opportunistic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As a proof of concept we showed that the promoter fusions were each activated by the expected antibiotics with known mechanisms of action. The armZ::luxCDABE fusion responded to antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis (macrolides, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines and aminoglycosides), ampC::luxCDABE was induced by {beta}-lactams and recA::luxCDABE was induced by quinolones.

Its minimally invasive collection procedure makes it ideal for studies in pediatric populations. Saliva is a heterogenous tissue composed of immune and buccal epithelial cells (BEC). Amongst the many epigenetic marks, DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most studied in human populations. Given DNAms integral role to cellular differentiation and maintenance, DNAm profiles are often highly cell type (CT)-specific and CT composition can drive salivary DNAm associations with environments or health as well as epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), discrepancy between chronological age and biological age derived from DNAm. To address this, reference-based CT deconvolution and statistically adjustment with estimated CT in DNAm analyses have become a common practice. However, it remains unclear how different CT reference panels--constructed from adult versus pediatric samples--affect DNAm results. Additionally, whether DNAm and EAA associations in saliva primarily originate from immune cells or BECs, or if they persist across saliva samples despite varying CT proportions, has yet to be examined.

The current study used salivary DNAm samples obtained from 529 children (mean age=7.26 years, SD=0.26 years) in a community-based cohort, the Family Life Project. Our results highlighted the impact of estimated CT discrepancies across child and adult reference panels on DNAm associations. Upon stratifying the salivary DNAm samples into three subsamples--primarily BECs, primarily immune cells, and an approximately equal mix of both, we found significantly different EAAs across stratified samples when CT proportions were not accounted for.

Teeth are excellent organs to study organ initiation competency because they can be activated with the addition of a single signaling ligand, Ectodysplasin (Eda). Eda, a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) ligand, is a critical regulator of ectodermal organ development, including teeth, acting through TNF receptors, like Edar, to activate NF-{kappa}B signaling in tooth precursor cells. While Eda is both necessary for normal tooth formation and sufficient for ectopic tooth formation, the spatial and temporal dynamics of competency for ectopic tooth initiation and maintenance remains unknown. To investigate the role of Eda in tooth specification, we generated transgenic sticklebacks and zebrafish with heat shock-inducible Eda overexpression. We find that stickleback Eda can drive de novo tooth formation in at least eight distinct oropharyngeal and cranial domains. Both zebrafish and stickleback exhibit maximal responsiveness to Eda overexpression during the critical window of pioneer tooth initiation, highlighting that the precursors of ectopic pharyngeal teeth likely follow a similar developmental trajectory as endogenous tooth precursors. Furthermore, we observe that some induced dental fields often undergo tooth regeneration to maintain themselves, allowing them to persist for months after the cessation of transgene activation. Finally, analysis of TNF receptor expression in sticklebacks reveals that ectopic tooth formation in the pharynx correlates with Edar and Troy expression, while in the region where teeth can form on the face, only Troy expression was detected, providing a possible molecular mechanism of competency involving spatially restricted receptor expression. These findings underscore the latent developmental potential, i.e. competency, of the vertebrate dentition and provide insights into organ competency during embryonic and post-embryonic development.",NA,biorxiv

Within the scope of the project AgriMet, the effectiveness of two new formulations of M. brunneum was evaluated over three years in the field, greenhouse and laboratory. The application of a soil granule and/or a wettable powder (dry product) of M. brunneum during potato planting aimed to reduce potato tuber damage by controlling wireworms. During field trials in the Lower Saxony (Germany), the combination of both formulations led to an effectiveness between 1 % and 13.6 % compared to the untreated control. The single application of the AgriMet-Granule and the AgriMet-Dry Product was less successful. The standardised greenhouse set-up in pots with A. obscurus indicated that an application rate of at least 300 kg ha-1 of the AgriMet-Granule, respectively 1x1013 conidia ha-1 of the AgriMet-Dry Product was necessary to effectively reduce tuber damage (44-54 %), while surprisingly no larval mortality was recorded. The laboratory experiments showed, that only the AgriMet-Dry Product provided a lethal potential against wireworms, whereas the AgriMet-Granule showed deficits in terms of product quality. However, the effectiveness of the AgriMet-Dry Product against A. obscurus, A. sputator and A. lineatus resulted in significant differences in mortality indicating a species-specific virulence of the M. brunneum isolate used. Additional influencing factors became apparent through analysing multiple soil parameters at the respective field site such as temperature, moisture, colony-forming units of Metarhizium spp. and wireworm density, underlining the complexity of wireworm control using a microbial control agent.

Do these limited father-offspring relationships also affect later-life outcomes for offspring? Working in a well-studied baboon population where males contribute little direct offspring care, we found that juvenile female baboons who had stronger paternal relationships, or who resided longer with their fathers, led adult lives that were 2-4 years longer than females with weak or short paternal relationships. This pattern did not differ between females who experienced high versus low levels of early-life adversity; hence, paternal relationships were equally protective in both harsh and benign early environments. Males relationships were strongest with juvenile females they were most likely to have sired and when males had few mating opportunities. Hence, father-daughter relationships may be constrained by male mating effort. Because survival predicts female fitness, fathers and their daughters may experience selection to engage socially and stay close in daughters early lives.",NA,biorxiv

Host-directed approaches present a promising avenue of development and carry the benefit of mitigating risks of viral escape mutants. We have previously found the SKI (super killer) complex to be a broad-spectrum, host-target with our lead compound (""UMB18"") showing activity against influenza, coronaviruses, and filoviruses. The SKI complex is a cytosolic RNA helicase and we previously found that targeting it with UMB18 inhibited viral RNA production but did not further define the mechanism. Here, transcriptomic analysis of UMB18 treated A549 cells revealed an upregulation of genes in the mevalonate pathway which drives cholesterol synthesis. Further investigation validated the genetic upregulation and confirmed an increase in total cellular cholesterol. This upregulation was dependent on the SKI complex, the sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) and their regulator SCAP, the major regulators for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Depletion of the SREBPs or SCAP with siRNA, or extraction of cholesterol with methyl {beta}-cyclodextrin attenuated UMB18 antiviral activity, emphasizing the role of increased cholesterol synthesis in this mechanism of action. Our findings further define the antiviral mechanism of a developmental host-directed therapeutic approach with broad applicability against emerging viral pathogens.

Author SummaryThe COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the urgent need for effective countermeasures to novel and emerging viral pathogens. Our research presented here builds upon our previously published data on an experimental novel antiviral compound termed UMB18. We have found this compound capable of inhibiting replication of influenza A virus, coronaviruses and the filoviruses Marburg and Ebola virus, but did not fully define a mechanism of action. In this work, we demonstrate that UMB18 exerts antiviral activity by modulating cellular cholesterol levels. By targeting the SKI complex, UMB18 triggers an increase in endogenous cellular cholesterol which disrupts the fine balance viruses rely on for efficient infection. We demonstrate that this mechanism inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2, revealing a previously undescribed host-directed strategy for antiviral intervention. These findings highlight UMB18s potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent and pave the way for further research into its mechanism and therapeutic applications, offering a promising avenue for development of antiviral countermeasures to current, novel and emerging pathogens.",NA,biorxiv

Other sequence features, such as specific k-mers or low complexity regions, have also been implicated [1-3]. However, in a dynamic biological process such as cell differentiation, we lack an understanding of how the transcriptional activity of CREs progressively change and what sequence features underlie these transitions, which may reflect common and/or coordinated regulatory processes. Here, we use single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to follow, at a genome scale, CREs along differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into cortical neurons and develop a method to automatically identify the diversity of CRE profiles and their underlying sequence features. We propose a machine-learning guided clustering algorithm, STOIC (Statistical learning TO Inform Clustering), that jointly learns an unsupervised clustering of the CREs in the space of the activity profiles and a supervised predictor associated with each cluster in the DNA-sequence space. STOIC is specifically designed to provide readily interpretable results. We show that the method identifies CRE profiles associated with highly predictive sequence features and outperforms methods solely concerned with co-activity clustering on this task. Orthogonal data collected in the same settings link the inferred CRE clusters to specific enhancer or promoter signatures. Furthermore, we show that the DNA features unveiled by STOIC reflect biologically relevant regulators and offer a valuable basis to dissect elements of the cisregulatory grammar. Finally, we demonstrate the general applicability of STOIC by analyzing five bulk CAGE datasets of human cells responding to various treatments.",NA,biorxiv

But how does one identify the neural basis of something that is intrinsically personal and subjective? A hallmark approach has been to ask observers to judge stimuli as  seen (conscious) and  unseen (unconscious) and use post hoc sorting of neural measurements based these judgments. Unfortunately, cognitive and response biases are known to strongly affect how observers place their criterion for judging stimuli as  seen vs.  unseen, thereby confounding neural measures of consciousness. Surprisingly however, the effect of conservative and liberal criterion placement on neural measures of unconscious and conscious processing has never been explicitly investigated. Here we use simulations and electrophysiological brain measurements to show that conservative criterion placement has an unintuitive consequence: rather than selectively providing a cautious estimate of conscious processing, it inflates effect sizes in neural measures of both conscious and unconscious processing, while liberal criterion placement does the reverse. After showing this in simulation, we performed decoding analyses on two electroencephalography studies that employ common subjective indicators of conscious awareness, in which we experimentally manipulated the response criterion. The results confirm that the predicted confounding effects of criterion placement on neural measures of unconscious and conscious processing occur in empirical data, while further showing that the most widely used subjective scale, the Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS), does not guard against criterion confounds. Follow-up simulations explicate how the experimental context determines whether the relative confounding effect of criterion placement is larger in neural measures of either conscious or unconscious processing. We conclude that criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of conscious and unconscious processing.",10.7554/eLife.102335,biorxiv

Adenoviral (Ad) based vaccines have played an integral part in this vaccine campaign, with licensed vaccines based on the simian Y25 isolate (Vaxzevria, Astrazeneca) and human Ad type 26 (Jcovden, Janssen) widely adopted. As part of the largest global vaccination programme ever undertaken, ultrarare thromboembolic events have been described in approximately 1:200,000 vaccinees administered with Ad based SARS-CoV2 vaccines.

ObjectivesThe mechanism underpinning these adverse events remain to be completely delineated, but is characterised by elevated autoantibodies against PF4 which, in complex with PF4, cluster, bind FC{gamma}RIIa on platelets and induce thrombus formation. Here we investigated the ability of ChAdOx1 to transduce and activate endothelial cells.

MethodsUsing protein sequence alignment tools and in vitro transduction assays, the ability of ChAdOx1 to infect endothelial cells was assessed. Furthermore, the ability of ChAdOx1 infection to activate endothelial cells was determined. Finally, using surface plasmon resonance we assessed the electrostatic interactions between the ChAdOx1 hexon and PF4.

Results and ConclusionsDespite lacking the primary cell entry receptor, Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR), ChAdOx1 efficiently transduced endothelial cells in a CAR-independent manner. This transduction did not result in endothelial cell activation. Purified hexon protein from ChAdOx1 preps did, however, bind PF4 with a similar affinity to that previously reported for the whole ChAdOx1 capsid. These data confirm the need to develop non-PF4 binding adenoviral capsids to reduce the potential adverse events associated with VITT.",NA,biorxiv

Inferring the past action of positive selection on protein-coding sequences is fundamental for deciphering phenotypic diversity and the emergence of novel traits. With the advent of genome-wide comparative genomic datasets, researchers can analyze selection not only at the level of individual genes but also globally, delivering systems-level insights into evolutionary dynamics. However, genome-scale datasets are generated with automated pipelines and imperfect curation that does not eliminate all sequencing, annotation, and alignment errors. Positive selection inference methods are highly sensitive to such errors. We present BUSTED-E: a method designed to detect positive selection for amino acid diversification while concurrently identifying some alignment errors. This method builds on the flexible branch-site random effects model (BUSTED) for fitting distributions of dN/dS, with a critical modification: it incorporates an ""error-sink"" component to represent an abiological evolutionary regime. Using several genome-scale biological datasets that were extensively filtered using state-of-the art automated alignment tools, we show that BUSTED-E identifies pervasive residual alignment errors, produces more realistic estimates of positive selection, reduces bias, and improves biological interpretation. The BUSTED-E model promises to be a more stringent filter to identify positive selection in genome-wide contexts, thus enabling further characterization and validation of the most biologically relevant cases.",NA,biorxiv

Signaling perturbations are necessary to discover which genes are responsive or insensitive to pathway activity. However, gene regulation is additionally dependent on cell state-specific factors like chromatin modifications or transcription factor binding. Thus, transcriptional profiles need to be assayed in single cells to identify potentially multiple, distinct perturbation responses among heterogeneous cell states in an embryo. In perturbation studies, comparing heterogeneous transcriptional states among experimental conditions often requires samples to be collected over multiple independent experiments. Datasets produced in such complex experimental designs can be confounded by batch effects. We present Design-Aware Integration of Single Cell ExpEriments (DAISEE), a new algorithm that models perturbation responses in single-cell datasets with a complex experimental design. We demonstrate that DAISEE improves upon a previously available integrative non-negative matrix factorization framework, more efficiently separating perturbation responses from confounding variation. We use DAISEE to integrate newly collected single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from 5-hour old zebrafish embryos expressing optimized photoswitchable MEK (psMEK), which globally activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a signaling molecule involved in many cell specification events. psMEK drives some cells that are normally not exposed to ERK signals towards other wild type states and induces novel states expressing a mixture of transcriptional programs, including precociously activated endothelial genes. ERK signaling is therefore capable of introducing profoundly new gene expression states in developing embryos.

Significance StatementSignaling perturbations produce heterogeneous transcriptional responses that must be measured at the single-cell level. Data integration techniques allow us to model these responses which, however, can be confounded by batch effects. We present a computational tool (DAISEE) for extracting the common and perturbation-specific features of single-cell datasets representing multiple experimental conditions while achieving efficient batch effect correction. DAISEE outperforms its predecessor and will enable accurate analysis of a broad range of single-cell datasets. DAISEE applied to new single-cell RNA sequencing data from zebrafish embryos shows that gain-of-function signaling perturbations can induce novel states. Our analysis suggests that a wild type endothelial cell-specification program can be activated in abnormal developmental contexts when the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is deregulated.",NA,biorxiv

While tremendous diversification of plant natural product pathways is well documented, how the upstream primary metabolism evolved in coordination with the lineage-specific pathways remain poorly understood. Here we studied the evolution of aromatic amino acid (AAA) biosynthesis during the emergence of tyrosine-derived lignin pathway uniquely found in grasses and closely related Poales. Phylogeny-guided in vitro and in planta functional analyses were conducted on two key regulatory enzymes--3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DHS) and arogenate dehydrogenase (TyrA)--catalyzing the first and last steps of AAA and tyrosine biosynthesis, respectively. Deregulated TyrAs were broadly present across Poales, with PACMAD grasses exhibiting stronger deregulation, suggesting that the active tyrosine biosynthesis likely emerged before, but were also selected upon, the evolution of tyrosine-lignin pathway. Conversely, DHS deregulation occurred more recently within BOP grasses after the emergence of tyrosine-lignin pathway, via multiple mutations that acted synergistically in the enzymes allosteric regulatory domain. The study highlights how the regulation of upstream primary metabolism is dynamically tuned both before and after the evolution of emerging natural product pathways.

A key quantification of the ABR is threshold, the lowest sound level that elicits a response. Because the morphology of ABR waveforms shift with stimulus level and the overall signal-to-noise ratio is low, threshold estimation is not straightforward. Although several algorithmic approaches have been proposed, the current standard practice remains the visual evaluation of ABR waveforms as a function of stimulus level.

We developed an algorithm based on the cross-correlation of two independent averages of responses to the same stimulus. For each stimulus level, the individual responses to each tone-pip are randomly split into two groups. The median waveform for each group is calculated, and then the normalized cross-correlation between these median waveforms is obtained. This process is repeated 500 times to obtain a resampled cross-correlation distribution. For each frequency, the mean values of these distributions are computed for each level and fit with a sigmoid or a power law function to estimate the threshold.

Algorithmic thresholds demonstrated robust and accurate performance, achieving 92% accuracy within {+/-}10 dB of human-rated thresholds on a large pool of mouse data. This performance was better than that of several published algorithms on the same dataset. This algorithm has now fully replaced the manual estimation of ABR thresholds for our preclinical studies, thereby saving significant time and enhancing objectivity in the process.",NA,biorxiv

In the gut, indole is a bacteriostatic compound produced by the microbiota and is thought to act as a chemorepellent for invading pathogens, thereby protecting the host against infection. The principal reservoir of intestinal indole is fecal matter, a complex biological material that contains both attractant and repellent stimuli. Whether indole in its natural context is sufficient for pathogen chemorepulsion or host protection has remained unknown. Using an intestinal explant system, we show that while pure indole indeed suppresses an infection advantage mediated through chemotaxis for the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, this effect is abolished in the presence of other chemoeffectors present in feces, including the chemoattractant L-Serine (L-Ser), in a manner dependent on the chemoreceptor Tsr. Live imaging reveals that although S. Typhimurium is repelled by pure indole, the pathogen is actually strongly attracted to human fecal matter despite its high indole content, and that this response is mediated by Tsr, which simultaneously senses both indole and L-Ser. Fecal attraction is conserved across diverse Enterobacteriaceae species that harbor Tsr orthologues, including Escherichia coli, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae, and clinical isolates of non-typhoidal Salmonella. In a defined system of fecal chemoeffectors, we find that L-Ser and other fecal chemoattractants override indole chemorepulsion, but the magnitude of bacterial chemoattraction is controlled by indole levels. Together, these findings suggest that indole in its native context is not protective against enteric infection and that indole taxis actually benefits pathogens during infection by locating niches with low competitor density. Our study highlights the limitations of applying single-effector studies in predicting bacterial behavior in natural environments, where chemotaxis is shaped by the integration of multiple, often opposing, chemical signals.",NA,biorxiv

The tumors are notoriously resistant to therapies and are often in locations that make gross total resections difficult. Here, we describe a new chordoma cell line (ARF-8) derived from an extensive clival chordoma that extended back to the cervical spine. From the cultured cell line we characterized the ARF-8 cellular and extracellular vesicle (EV) proteomes, as well as the impacts of ARF-8 EVs on proteomes and secretomes of recipient cells (both ARF-8 and human osteoblasts) in autocrine and paracrine settings. All the characteristics associated with chordomas as cancers - migration and invasion, therapeutic resistance, metastatic potential - can be driven by tumor EVs. Our proteomic analyses suggested roles for transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) and cell-matrix interactions involving the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cell/extracellular matrix interactions in cell migration, consistent with a metastatic tumor phenotype. Our results demonstrated that ARF-8 tumor cell migration was dependent on general (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid [RGD]-based) integrin activity, and ARF-8 EVs could promote such migration. ARF-8 EVs also prompted proteomic/secretomic changes in human osteoblast cells, again with indications that cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions would be activated. Overall, the EVs promoted predicted tumorigenic phenotypes in recipient cells.",NA,biorxiv

Detailed clustering demonstrated unique fibroblasts specific to lupus skin with likely roles in inflammatory cell recruitment and fibrosis. We also evaluated the association of retroelement expression with type I interferons in the skin. We observed increased retroelement expression which correlated with interferon-stimulated genes across multiple cell types. Moreover, we saw elevated expression of genes involved in RIG-I and cGAS-STING pathways, which transduce elevated nucleic acid signals. Treatment of active cutaneous lupus with Anifrolumab reduced RIG-I and cGAS-STING pathways in addition to the most abundant retroelement family, L2b.

Adipocytes, abundant in mammary tissue, store and release cholesterol, which can be hydroxylated to form oxysterols. These cholesterol derivatives activate the liver X receptor (LXR) pathway. This study tested the hypothesis that adipocytes contribute to an imbalanced tumour-microenvironment by exposing cancer cells to elevated oxysterols, mimicking chemotherapy-exposure conditions and priming for chemoresistance.

MethodsTumour tissue microarray from 148 TNBC patients was assessed using immunohistochemistry for expression of CH25H, CYP46A1, CYP27A1 and P-glycoprotein, and survival outcomes assessed. Gene expression was compared between tumours from patients and mouse models with high versus low adiposity. In vitro, cells of the tumour-microenvironment were evaluated for oxysterol content, secretion, expression of relevant enzymes, and their ability to induce P-glycoprotein expression and drug resistance in TNBC cells.

ResultsIn patients, expression of oxysterol-synthesizing enzymes in stroma correlated with P-glycoprotein expression in cancer epithelial cells and was associated with shorter disease-free survival. Adipocytes conditioned media contained significantly higher oxysterols levels than that conditioned by other cell types and induced P-glycoprotein expression and drug resistance in MDA.MB.468 cells. Obese mice had elevated levels of P-glycoprotein in tumours compared to lean counterparts.

ConclusionsAdipocytes secrete oxysterols that promote drug resistance in vitro and correlate with oxysterol:Pgp axis and survival in vivo.

SignificanceThis study reveals a mechanism by which adipose tissue contributes to drug resistance in ER-negative breast cancers, identifying the oxysterol-Pgp axis as potential therapeutic target.",NA,biorxiv

However, the intricate task of precisely mapping vasculature across brain regions and cortical layers presents formidable challenges, resulting in a limited understanding of neurometabolic factors influencing the brains microvasculature. Addressing this gap, our study investigates whole-brain vascular volume using ferumoxytol-weighted laminar-resolution multi-echo gradient-echo imaging in macaque monkeys. We validate the results with published data for vascular densities and compare them with cytoarchitecture, neuron and synaptic densities. The ferumoxytol-induced change in transverse relaxation rate ({Delta}R2*), an indirect proxy measure of cerebral blood volume (CBV), was mapped onto twelve equivolumetric laminar cortical surfaces. Our findings reveal that CBV varies 3-fold across the brain, with the highest vascular volume observed in the inferior colliculus and lowest in the corpus callosum. In the cerebral cortex, CBV is notably high in early primary sensory areas and low in association areas responsible for higher cognitive functions. Classification of CBV into distinct groups unveils extensive replication of translaminar vascular network motifs, suggesting distinct computational energy supply requirements in areas with varying cytoarchitecture types. Regionally, baseline R2* and CBV exhibit positive correlations with neuron density and negative correlations with receptor densities. Adjusting image resolution based on the critical sampling frequency of penetrating cortical vessels allows us to delineate approximately 30% of the arterial-venous vessels. Collectively, these results mark significant methodological and conceptual advancements, contributing to the refinement of cerebrovascular MRI. Furthermore, our study establishes a linkage between neurometabolic factors and the vascular network architecture in the primate brain.

Self-proteins are presented to T cells in the thymus during immune cell development2,3, and must be presented throughout the body to both maintain regulatory T cell populations4-6 and provide a tonic signal to maintain conventional T cells over time7-9. The ready observations of continuous apoptosis in some organs together with the ingestion of that material by myeloid populations has led to a conventional understanding of ongoing cell-death as a major source of self-antigens10, complemented in some situations by uptake of free-floating cell-derived vesicles. Here, we used a series of companion imaging and vesicular labeling technologies to reveal an alternate process undertaken by macrophages that results in non-destructive and direct sampling of living cells. The process requires cell-cell contact, does not require caspase activation, and takes place via a trogocytosis-like stretching of the target cell into the macrophage, leading to the generation of submicron-sized vesicles containing cytoplasm. Using a high-dimensional flow-based method for labeling vesicles ingested under this versus other conditions, we find that live-sampled material is distinctly processed, is poorly subject to fusion with lysosomes, and produces ensuing differential effects on the presentation of those to CD4 versus CD8 T cells. This demonstrates an important and substantial sampling of living cells by the immune system, with clear consequences for maintaining the border of immunity.",NA,biorxiv

These graphs reduce reference bias in read mapping and enhance variant discovery and genotyping from SNPs to Structural Variants (SVs). In pangenome graphs, variants appear as bubbles, which can be detected by dedicated bubble calling tools. Although these tools report essential information on the variant bubbles, such as their position and allele walks in the graph, they do not annotate the type of the detected variants. While simple SNPs, insertions, and deletions are easily distinguishable by allele size, large balanced variants like inversions are harder to differentiate among the large number of unannotated bubbles. In fact, inversions and other types of large variants remain underexplored in pangenome graph benchmarks and analyses.

In this work we focused on inversions, which have been drawing renewed attention in evolutionary genomics studies in the past years, and aimed to assess how this type of variant is handled by state of the art pangenome graphs pipelines. We identified two distinct topological motifs for inversion bubbles: one path-explicit and one alignment-rescued, and developed a tool to annotate them from bubble-caller outputs. We constructed pangenome graphs with both simulated data and real data using four state of the art pipelines, and assessed the impact of inversion size, punctual genome divergence and haplotype number on inversion representation and accuracy.

Our results reveal substantial differences between pipelines, with many inversions either mis-represented or lost. Most notably, recovery rates remain strikingly low, even with the most simple simulated genome sets, highlighting major challenges in analyzing inversions in pangenomic approaches.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we generate single-cell RNA and ATAC multiomic data to simultaneously characterize gene expression and chromatin accessibility of [~]33,000 mouse liver cells across the 24-hour day. Our study yields several key insights, including: (i) detecting circadian rhythmicity in both discretized liver cell types and transient sub-lobule cell states, capturing space-time RNA and ATAC profiles in a cell-type- and cell-state-specific manner; (ii) delving beyond mean cyclic patterns to characterize distributions, accounting for gene expression stochasticity due to transcriptional bursting; (iii) interrogating multimodal circadian rhythmicity, encompassing RNAs, DNA regulatory elements, and transcription factors (TFs), while examining priming and lagging effects across modalities; and (iv) inferring spatiotemporal gene regulatory networks involving target genes, TFs, and cis-regulatory elements that controls circadian rhythmicity and liver physiology.

We quantified F1 hybrid male sterility and characterized multiple phenotypic causes associated with developmental abnormalities in the germline as well as non-germline gonad and somatic tissues, uncovering a complex suite of developmental defects contributing to strong postzygotic reproductive isolation. Despite these multifarious isolating barrier traits, assays testing for interspecies sperm transfer under ""choice"" conditions did not yield evidence of premating isolation. In contrast to other Caenorhabditis species pairs, we also found no evidence that ectopic sperm migration acts as a postmating-prezygotic barrier. The constellation of phenotypic defects in hybrids points to a polygenic or highly pleiotropic basis for hybrid dysfunction and implicates more rapid evolution of intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation than prezygotic isolation in these organisms.",NA,biorxiv

It manifests as early EEG changes, that are region-, time- and state-specific, possibly reflecting distinct mechanisms of injury.

Here, we investigated the effects of 5mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on hippocampal and cortical sleep-wake states, oscillatory and non-oscillatory neuronal activity, as well as on within and between state dynamics using state-space analysis.

LPS induced rapid-onset severe temporal and spatial vigilance state fragmentation, which preceded all other spectral changes by [~]90 minutes. Thereafter, LPS led to specific destabilization and increased delta oscillatory activity in wakefulness, but not NREM sleep, although state transitions remained largely normal. Instead, reduced NREM delta power resulted from aperiodic spectrum changes. LPS specifically reduced higher frequency hippocampal gamma oscillations (60-80Hz peak) in wakefulness, but not cortical high gamma or lower frequency gamma oscillations.

These results suggest that disruption of sleep-wake patterns could serve as an early indicator of sepsis and associated encephalopathy, independent of spectral changes. Moreover, treatment aimed at stabilizing vigilance states in early stages of sepsis might prove to be a novel option preventing the development of further pathological neurophysiology, as well as limiting inflammation-related brain damage.",NA,biorxiv

In this work, we examine combination treatments of type II Abl1 inhibitors and asciminib (an allosteric regulator) through a computational model at patient relevant concentrations.

We find that the simultaneous cobinding of type II inhibitors and asciminib is high in synergetic combinations. As an aid to designing and comparing combination treatments, we put forward an equation that expands on the effective ratio of IC50 (ERIC). Unlike usual comparisons of IC50 values, ERIC takes takes patient plasma concentrations into account. The product of two ERIC values (ERICcombo) creates comparable approximations of the effectiveness of combination treatments with low levels of synergy or antagonism at different concentrations.

In particular, sequence alignment is a fundamental building block in many sequence analysis pipelines and is frequently a performance bottleneck both in terms of execution time and memory usage. Classical sequence alignment algorithms are based on dynamic programming and often require quadratic time and memory with respect to the sequence length. As a result, classical sequence alignment algorithms fail to scale with increasing sequence lengths and quickly become memory-bound due to data-movement penalties.

ResultsProcessing-In-Memory (PIM) is an emerging architectural paradigm that seeks to accelerate memory-bound algorithms by bringing computation closer to the data to mitigate data-movement penalties. This work presents BIMSA (Bidirectional In-Memory Sequence Alignment), a PIM design and implementation for the state-of-the-art sequence alignment algorithm BiWFA (Bidirectional Wavefront Alignment), incorporating new hardware-aware optimizations for a production-ready PIM architecture (UPMEM). BIMSA supports aligning sequences up to 100K bases, exceeding the limitations of state-of-the-art PIM implementations. First, BIMSA achieves speedups up to 22.24x (11.95x on average) compared to state-of-the-art PIM-enabled implementations of sequence alignment algorithms. Second, achieves speedups up to 5.84x (2.83x on average) compared to the highest-performance multicore CPU implementation of BiWFA. Third, BIMSA exhibits linear scalability with the number of compute units in memory, enabling further performance improvements with upcoming PIM architectures equipped with more compute units and achieving speedups up to 9.56x (4.7x on average).

We develop an approach based on clustering to design a diverse library of 90 DNA sequences to screen for a glucose response. The most responsive sequence was further improved based on favorable mutations predicted by deep learning and pattern recognition. This combination of experimental screening and supervised and unsupervised machine learning represents a generalizable approach to developing DNA-SWCNT sensors for even the most elusive analytes.

In addition to its canonical function in regulating microtubule dynamics, Tau modulates chromatin compaction, gene expression, and the cellular response to DNA damage. During the DNA damage response, Tau positively modulates P53 by binding to MDM2 thereby preventing P53 inactivation and degradation. The aberrant presence of both MDM2 associated to neurofibrillary tangles and of P53 misfolding in brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases suggests that the sequestration of MDM2 may prevent P53 clearance in tauopathies and so contribute to progressive neuronal dysfunction and death. Following this evidence, a pharmacological inhibition of the Tau/MDM2 interaction may represent a viable strategy to reduce P53-dependent cell damage in brain disorders. With the screening FDA-approved drugs and natural compounds, we discovered that members of the aminoglycoside antibiotic family antagonize the Tau/MDM2 interaction. The use of these reagents may advance the understanding of the implication of the Tau/MDM2/P53 axis in neurodegeneration models. However, their unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties may limit their systemic use when targeting the brain.",NA,biorxiv

We investigated how 27 Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) adapt their navigation strategies to return to their colony amid regional tidal ocean currents. Using GPS-enhanced dead-reckoning loggers and high-resolution ocean current data, we reconstructed penguin travel vectors during foraging trips to assess their responses to variable currents during their colony-bound movements. By integrating estimates of energy costs and prey pursuits, we found that birds balanced direct navigation with current-driven drift: in calm currents, they maintained precise line-of-sight headings to their colony. In stronger currents, they aligned their return with lateral flows, which increased travel distance, but at minimal energy costs, and provided them with increased foraging opportunities. Since the lateral tidal currents always reversed direction over the course of return paths, the penguins return paths were consistently S-shaped but still resulted in the birds returning efficiently to their colonies. These findings suggest that Magellanic penguins can sense current drift and use it to optimize energy expenditure by maintaining overall directional accuracy while capitalizing on foraging opportunities.",NA,biorxiv

However, a data-driven understanding of behavior and its modulation in solitary and social contexts is lacking. In this study, we employed motion sequencing (""MoSeq"") to decompose mouse behaviors into discrete units (""Syllables"") and investigate whether--and how--the behavioral repertoire differs between solitary and dyadic (social) settings.

Our results reveal that social context significantly modulates a minority (25%) of syllables, containing predominantly stationary and undirected behaviors. Notably, these changes are associated with spatial proximity to another mouse rather than active social contact. Interestingly, a network analysis of syllable transitions shows that context-sensitive syllables exhibit altered network influence, independent of the number of connected syllables, suggesting a regulatory role. Furthermore, syllable composition changes significantly during social contact events with two distinct sequence families governing approach and withdrawal behaviors. However, no unique syllable sequences mapped to specific social interactions.

Overall, our findings suggest that a subset of syllables drives contextual behavioral adaptation in mice, potentially fascilitating transitions within the broader behavioral repertoire. This highlights the utility of MoSeq in dissecting nuanced, context-dependent behavioral dynamics.",NA,biorxiv

We found that selective ligands activate the extranuclear pathway by a mechanism involving proton transfer. The low affinity ligand and widespread endocrine disruptor Bisphenol-A (BPA) initiated nuclear and extranuclear actions. BPA concentrations similar to the receptor affinity initiated the nuclear pathway, whereas much lower concentrations initiated the extranuclear pathway. Experiments in different cell types using deuterated molecules of BPA (d16-BPA) and the ER{beta} agonist, diarylpropionitrile (d2-DPN), indicated that a proton transfer from the hydroxyl groups to an amino acid acceptor within the ligand binding domain is required to activate the extranuclear pathway. Activation of the extranuclear pathway by BPA caused a rapid change in the ER{beta}-associated interactome that did not occur with d16-BPA. To investigate this mechanism in a physiological system, we acutely injected BPA and d16-BPA into male mice. BPA rapidly decreased blood glucose and increased serum C-peptide levels, whereas d16-BPA had no effect. In mouse pancreatic {beta}-cells, acute treatment with BPA closed ATP-dependent K+ channels and increased glucose-induced insulin secretion, however d16-BPA was without effect. Contrary to d16-BPA, BPA modified electrical activity and increased apoptosis. RNA sequencing indicated that neither BPA nor d16-BPA significantly altered gene expression. Our findings suggests that the extranuclear actions of ERs are initiated by a mechanism that requires proton transfer from ligands and may have important biological consequences. This mechanism may work for other ligands, nuclear receptors and cell types.

While the molecular players of active repression are well described, their dynamics remain obscure. Here, we used snail expression dynamics as a paradigm to uncover how repression, mediated by the Snail (Sna) repressor, can be imposed within a developing tissue. Combining live imaging and mathematical modeling, we show that Sna-mediated repression is cooperative and that cooperativity is primarily mediated by the distal enhancer. Repression shifts transcription bursting dynamics from a two-state ON/OFF regime to a three-state repressed regime with two temporally distinct OFF states. Mutating Sna binding sites suggests that repression introduces the long-lasting inactive state, which is stabilized by cooperativity. Our approach offers quantitative insights into the dynamics of repression and how transcription factor cooperativity coordinates cell fate decisions within a tissue.",NA,biorxiv

However, GRIN lenses have intrinsic optical aberrations, which severely degrade their imaging performance. GRIN aberrations decrease the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution of fluorescence signals, especially in lateral portions of the field-of-view (FOV), leading to restricted FOV and smaller number of recorded neurons. This is especially relevant for GRIN lenses of several millimeters in length, which are needed to reach the deeper regions of the rodent brain. We have previously demonstrated a novel method to enlarge the FOV and improve the spatial resolution of 2P microendoscopes based on GRIN lenses of length < 4.1 mm (Antonini et al. eLife 2020). However, previously developed microendoscopes were too short to reach the most ventral regions of the mouse brain. In this study, we combined optical simulations with fabrication of aspherical polymer microlenses through three-dimensional (3D) microprinting to correct for optical aberrations in long (length > 6 mm) GRIN lens-based microendoscopes (diameter, 500 {micro}m). Long corrected microendoscopes had improved spatial resolution, enabling imaging in significantly enlarged FOVs. Moreover, using synthetic calcium data we showed that aberration correction enabled detection of cells with higher SNR of fluorescent signals and decreased cross-contamination between neurons. Finally, we applied long corrected microendoscopes to perform large-scale and high precision recordings of calcium signals in populations of neurons in the olfactory cortex, a brain region laying approximately 5 mm from the brain surface, of awake head-tethered mice. Long corrected microendoscopes are powerful new tools enabling population imaging with unprecedented large FOV and high spatial resolution in the most ventral regions of the mouse brain.",10.7554/eLife.101420,biorxiv

Previously, we used in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to reveal the native thylakoid architecture of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [1] and then map the molecular organization of these thylakoids with single-molecule precision [2]. However, it remains to be shown how generalizable this green algal blueprint is to the thylakoids of vascular plants, which possess distinct membrane architecture subdivided into grana stacks interconnected by non-stacked stromal lamellae. Here, we continue our cryo-ET investigation to reveal the molecular architecture of thylakoids within intact chloroplasts isolated from spinach (Spinacia oleracea). We visualize the fine ultrastructural details of grana membranes, as well as interactions between thylakoids and plastoglobules. We apply and further develop AI-based computational approaches for automated membrane segmentation and membrane protein picking [3], enabling us to quantify the organization of photosynthetic complexes within the plane of the thylakoid membrane and across adjacent stacked membranes. Our analysis reveals that, despite different 3D architecture, the molecular organization of thylakoid membranes in vascular plants and green algae is strikingly similar. In contrast to isolated plant thylakoids, where semi-crystalline arrays of photosystem II (PSII) appear to hold some membranes together, we find in intact chloroplasts that PSII is non-crystalline and has uniform concentration both within the membrane plane and across stacked grana membranes. Similar to C. reinhardtii, we observe strict lateral heterogeneity of PSII and PSI at the boundary between appressed and non-appressed thylakoid domains, with no evidence for a distinct grana margin region where these complexes have been proposed to intermix. Based on these measurements, we support a simple two-domain model for the molecular organization of thylakoid membranes in both green algae and plants.",NA,biorxiv

A strength of the system is that marine populations have repeatedly colonized freshwater environments, serving as natural biological replicates. These replicates have enabled researchers to efficiently identify phenotypes and genotypes under selection during this transition. While this repeated adaptation to freshwater has occurred throughout the northern hemisphere, the Cook Inlet in south-central Alaska has been an area of focus. The freshwater lakes in this area are being studied extensively and there is a high-quality freshwater reference assembly from a population in the region, Bear Paw Lake. Using a freshwater reference assembly is a potential limitation because genomic segments are repeatedly lost during freshwater adaptation. This scenario results in some of the key regions associated with marine-freshwater divergence being absent from freshwater genomes, and therefore absent from the reference assemblies. It may also be that isolated freshwater populations are more genetically diverged, potentially increasing reference biases. Here we present a highly-continuous marine assembly from Rabbit Slough in the Cook Inlet. All contigs are from long-read sequencing and have been ordered and oriented with Hi-C. The contigs are anchored to chromosomes and form a 454 Mbp assembly with an N50 of 1.3 Mbp, an L50 of 95, and a BUSCO score over 97%. The organization of the chromosomes in this marine individual is similar to existing freshwater assemblies, but with important structural differences, including the 3 previously known inversions that repeatedly separate marine and freshwater ecotypes. We anticipate that this high-quality marine assembly will more accurately reflect the ancestral population that founded the freshwater lakes in the area and will more closely match most other populations from around the world. This marine assembly, which includes the repeatedly deleted segments and offers a closer reference sequence for most populations, will enable more comprehensive and accurate computational and functional genomic investigations of Threespine Stickleback evolution.",10.1093/g3journal/jkaf114,biorxiv

We applied this approach to TeeVax3, a Group A Streptococcus vaccine candidate, to investigate the antibody response generated in a pre-clinical rabbit model and assess antigen immunogenicity. Surprisingly, we found a strong bias in antibody binding response towards the N-terminal epitope tag used for purification. These tags are widely reported to have low immunogenicity and are frequently left uncleaved in pre-clinical studies. We further confirmed that the observed immune response against the epitope tag dominated even the conformational binding response and, using synthetic peptides, narrowed the epitope down to a set of 10 residues inclusive of the Histidine residues.

Using a multi-omics approach, CPT1B was selected as a potential marker for SL, which was confirmed via its overexpression in immunohistochemical studies. Using a zebrafish model, CPT1B was implicated in melanogenesis. Discussion: CPT1B-mediated metabolic alteration is a key driver of SL pathogenesis. Targeting CPT1B and the associated lipid metabolism pathways is a novel therapeutic approach for managing SL and age-related pigmentation disorders.",NA,biorxiv

An increasing body of empirical evidence links sustained tonic M/EEG activity to evidence accumulation and tracking the predictability, or inferred precision, of the auditory stimulus. However, it remains unclear whether, and how, this process depends on auditory contextual memory. In the present EEG study, we examined neural responses to sound sequences across two experiments, and compared them to predictions from ideal observer models with varying memory spans. Stimuli were sequences of 50 ms long tone-pips. In Experiment 1 (N=26; both sexes), a regularly repeating sequence of 10 tones (REG) transitioned directly to a different regular sequence (REGxREGy). In Experiment 2 (N=28; both sexes), the same regular sequence was repeated after an intervening random segment (REGxINTREGx). Results from Experiment 2 revealed that the inferred predictability of the resumed REGx pattern was influenced by the preceding INT tones, even several seconds after they ended, indicating that the brain retains contextual memory over time. In contrast, neural responses in Experiment 1 were best explained by models with minimal memory. This dissociation implies that the brain can dynamically adjust its strategy based on inferred environmental structure--resetting context when interruptions signal change, and preserving context when patterns are likely to resume.",NA,biorxiv

Moreover, there is little consideration of individual differences in value processing that may shape how dopamine regulates decision-making. Here, using an economic foraging task in mice, we found that dopamine dynamics in the nucleus accumbens core reflected decision confidence during evaluation of decisions, as well as both past and future value during re-evaluation and change-of-mind.

Our objective was to understand whether cow cohabitation in homes with soil floors in rural Bangladesh contributed to the presence and diversity of potential pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the home. In 10 randomly selected households in rural Sirajganj District, we sampled floor soil and cow dung, which is commonly used as sealant in soil floors. We extracted DNA and performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing to explore potential pathogens and ARGs in each sample type. We detected 6 potential pathogens in soil only, 49 pathogens in cow dung only, and 167 pathogens in both soil and cow dung. Pathogen species with relative abundances >5% in both soil floors and cow dung from the same households included E. coli (N=8 households), Salmonella enterica (N=6), Klebsiella pneumoniae (N=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=1). Cow dung exhibited modestly higher pathogen genus richness compared to soil floors (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p=0.002). Using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, pathogen species community composition differed between floors and cow dung (PERMANOVA p<0.001). All soil floors and cow dung samples contained ARGs against antibiotic classes including sulfonamides, rifamycin, aminoglycosides, lincosamides, and tetracycline. Paired floor and cow dung samples shared ARGs against rifamycin. Our findings support the development of interventions to reduce soil and animal feces exposure in rural, low-income settings.

ImportanceIn low-income countries, inadequate housing materials and animal cohabitation can lead to fecal contamination of rural homes. Contaminated soil floors are difficult to clean and may harbor organisms causing illness and antibiotic resistance, especially in young children, who frequently ingest soil. We sequenced soil floor and cow dung samples from households in Sirajganj district, Bangladesh and identified pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes. We detected 167 pathogens in both soil and cow dung; pathogens present in both sample types at the highest relative abundances were E. coli, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiotic resistance genes were found in all samples. In cow dung, the most common genes conferred resistance to the antibiotics lincosamide, rifamycin, cephamycin, and tetracycline. In soil floors, the most common genes conferred resistance to rifamycin, sulfonamides, and aminoglycosides. Household soil and cow dung may be important reservoirs of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in low-income countries.",NA,biorxiv

This social context-dependent modulation overrides responses to other external sensory cues and is shaped by developmental social experience. Leveraging the genetic toolbox available in Drosophila, we find that different sensory modalities are required for normal social context modulation.

However, it is unknown how acute amphetamine affects brain areas involved in executive control, such as the prefrontal cortex. We studied this problem in mice using interval timing, which requires participants to estimate an interval of several seconds with a motor response. Rodent prefrontal cortex ensembles are required for interval timing. We tested the hypothesis that amphetamine disrupts interval timing by degrading prefrontal cortex temporal encoding.

MethodsWe first quantified the effects of amphetamine on interval timing performance by conducting a meta-analysis of 11 prior rodent studies. We also implanted multielectrode recording arrays in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of 7 mice and then examined the effects of 1.5 mg/kg D-amphetamine injected intraperitoneally on interval timing behavior and prefrontal neuronal ensemble activity.

ResultsA meta-analysis of previous literature revealed that amphetamine produces a large effect size on interval timing variability across studies but only a medium effect size on central tendencies of interval timing. We found a similar effect on interval timing variability in our task, which was accompanied by greater trial-to-trial variability in prefrontal ramping, attenuated interactions between pairs of ramping neurons, and dampened low-frequency oscillations.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that amphetamine alters prefrontal temporal processing by increasing the variability of prefrontal ramping. Our work provides insight into how amphetamine affects timing-related brain activity, which may be useful in developing new neurophysiological markers for amphetamine use and novel treatments targeting the prefrontal cortex.",NA,biorxiv

They are widely distributed in eukaryotes and are important for understanding genome evolution and speciation. We had previously identified a pollen killer in hybrids between two distant natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. This pollen killer involves three genetically linked genes, and we previously reported the identification of the gene encoding the antidote that protects pollen grains from the killer activity. In this study, we identified the two other genes of the pollen killer by using CRISPR-Cas9 induced mutants. These two genes are necessary for the killer activity that we demonstrated to be specific to pollen. The cellular localization of the pollen killer encoded proteins indicates that the pollen killer activity involves the mitochondria. Sequence analyses reveal predicted domains from the same families in the killer proteins. In addition, the C-terminal half of one of the killer proteins is identical to the antidote, and one amino acid, crucial for the antidote activity, is also essential for the killer function. Investigating more than 700 worldwide accessions of A. thaliana, we confirmed that the locus is subject to important structural rearrangements and copy number variation. By exploiting available de novo genomic sequences, we propose a scenario for the emergence of this pollen killer in A. thaliana. Furthermore, we report the co-occurrence and behavior of killer and sensitive genotypes in several local populations, a prerequisite for studying gamete killer evolution in the wild. This highlights the potential of the Arabidopsis model not only for functional studies of gamete killers but also for investigating their evolutionary trajectories at complementary geographical scales.

Author SummaryCertain genetic elements are qualified as selfish because they favor their transmission to the progeny during reproduction to the detriment of gametes that do not carry them. These elements are widespread in fungi as well as in plants or in animals, and they are made up of two or even three components, which are specific to each species. Therefore, they must be studied on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, understanding how they appear and propagate in local population remains a major issue in evolutionary biology. Here we have characterized, in the model plant Arabidopsis, the three genes involved in such an element, called a pollen killer. This pollen killer targets the mitochondria to cause the death of pollen grains that do not carry it. We investigated the three genes in several hundred genotypes collected worldwide, giving us a global view of their diversity at the species level. We also found that some French local populations contain both sensitive and killer plants, which constitutes an invaluable resource for studying the evolution of a pollen killer in the wild.",NA,biorxiv

However, our knowledge of how this landscape is set during vertebrate embryogenesis has been limited, due to the lack of methods to jointly detect chromatin modifications and gene expression in the same cell. Here we present a multimodal measurement of full-length transcriptome and chromatin modifications in individual cells during early embryonic development in zebrafish. We show that before the formation of germ layers, the chromatin and transcription states of cells are uncoupled, and become progressively connected during gastrulation and somitogenesis. Silencing of key developmental genes is achieved by local spreading of repressive chromatin as development proceeds. We use a joint analysis of transcription factor (TF) expression and chromatin states to predict lineage-specific activators and repressors and identify a subset of TFs that are themselves epigenetically regulated. Altogether, our data resolves the dynamic relationship between chromatin and transcription during early embryonic development and clarifies how these two layers interact to establish cell identity.",NA,biorxiv

We developed an algorithm that tracks simulated division and death events in mechanistically-detailed single-cell lineages to enable such a model/data comparison and suggest causes of cell-cell drug response variability. Using our previously developed model of mammalian single-cell proliferation and death signaling, we simulated drug dose response experiments for four targeted anti-cancer drugs (alpelisib, neratinib, trametinib and palbociclib) and compared them to experimental data. Simulations are consistent with data for strong growth inhibition by trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and overall lack of efficacy for alpelisib (PI-3K inhibitor), but are inconsistent with data for palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) and neratinib (EGFR inhibitor). Model/data inconsistencies suggest that (i) the importance of CDK4/6 for driving the cell cycle may be overestimated, and (ii) the cellular balance between basal (tonic) and ligand-induced signaling is a critical determinant of receptor inhibitor response. Simulations show subpopulations of rapidly and slowly dividing cells in both control and drug-treated conditions. Variations in mother cells prior to drug treatment impinging on ERK pathway activity are associated with the rapidly dividing phenotype and trametinib resistance.

The nucleus accumbens is of particular interest in reinstatement due to its ability to energize motivated behavior. Indeed, previous work has demonstrated that suppression of neuronal activity or dopaminergic signaling in the nucleus accumbens reduces reinstatement to food seeking. In this study, we sought to further establish a connection between glutamatergic input, measured by proxy via a genetically encoded calcium indicator, and dopamine (DA) tone, measured simultaneously with a red-shifted DA biosensor. We performed this sensor multiplexing in the nucleus accumbens core in the classic extinction-reinstatement paradigm with food reward. We detected DA transients that changed in magnitude and/or temporally shifted over the course of self-administration training. In our calcium traces we observed a decrease from baseline time-locked to the lever press for food reward, which became more prominent with training. Both patterns were reduced in the first session of extinction with no deflections from baseline detected in either the DA or calcium traces in the last extinction session. When we recorded during reinstatement tests, bootstrapping analysis detected a calcium response when reinstatement was primed by cue or pellet+cue presentation, while a DA response was detected for pellet+cue reinstatement. These data further establish a role for nucleus accumbens core activity and DA in reinstatement of food seeking and represent the first attempt to simultaneously record the two during an extinction-reinstatement task.",NA,biorxiv

Most insights on the neuroplastic effects of repetitive stimulation protocols stem from non-invasive human studies (TMS/EEG) or data from rodent slice physiology. Here, we developed a rodent experimental preparation enabling simultaneous imaging of cellular activity during stimulation in vivo to understand the mechanisms by which brain stimulation modulates excitability of prefrontal cortex.

MethodsRepetitive trains of intracortical stimulation were applied to the medial prefrontal cortex using current parameters mapped to human rTMS electric-field estimates. Calcium imaging of glutamatergic (CamKII) and GABAergic (mDLX) neurons was performed before, during, and after stimulation in awake rodents (n=9 females). Protocols included low-frequency (1 Hz, 1000 pulses) and high-frequency (10 Hz, 3000 pulses), with sham stimulation as a control.

ResultsGlutamatergic neurons were differentially modulated by stimulation frequency, with 10 Hz increasing and 1 Hz decreasing activity. Post-stimulation, 1 Hz suppressed both glutamatergic and GABAergic activity, whereas 10 Hz selectively suppressed GABAergic neurons.

In studies where human subjects make decisions based on the average of a sequence of numbers, recency effects are typically modeled phenomenologically through exponential discounting, while primacy effects are neglected altogether. Here, we exhibit the prevalence of both effects in such tasks, and propose that they result from the observers imprecision in their running tally of how many pieces of information they have received. If their approximate counting follows a central tendency -- a typical Bayesian pattern -- then past information is overweighted near the beginning of the sequence, while new numbers are overweighted towards the end of the sequence. Thus both primacy and recency effects are simultaneously predicted by this single mechanism. The model moreover nests exponential discounting as a special case in which the observer has no information about the count. The behavioral data suggests that subjects indeed misestimate the count of observations, with biases similar to those observed in numerosity-estimation tasks. Finally, we present evidence that the central tendency of subjects shifts towards lower counts in tasks with shorter sequence lengths, consistent with a Bayesian estimation of the counts. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive processes underlying serial-position effects in averaging tasks, with broader implications for other cognitive domains.",NA,biorxiv

Although a growing number of studies are utilizing infant and toddler stool for transcriptomic analyses, no studies have compared protocols for preserving and extracting miRNAs from this specimen type, despite unique challenges, including abundant levels of RNAses and microbial RNA.

MethodsTo address this, we first compared three commercially available kits and four preservation methods for their ability to yield high quality RNA from infant and toddler stool (Phase 1). RNA quality was determined by fragment analyzer.

ResultsOf the three RNA extraction kits compared, Zymo BIOMICs yielded the highest overall RNA Quality Number (RQN) (median (range) RQN 9.4 (5.7-10.0)). Of the four preservation methods tested, stool collected in RNAlater and Zymo DNA/RNA Shield Fecal Collection Tubes yielded the highest two RQNs (median (range) RQN 9.8 (5.7-10.0) and 9.4 (5.4-10.0), respectively), which did not differ significantly from each other (p = 0.47). Second, using miRNA-seq we directly compared miRNA profiles for RNA extracted using the Zymo BIOMICs kit from paired aliquots of the same stool sample from four infants collected into RNAlater and Zymo DNA/RNA Shield Fecal Collection Tubes (Phase 2). Given that microbial sequences greatly outnumber human miRNAs in stool, reads were first classified as human versus microbial prior to aligning human-classified reads to miRBase v22.1. The percentage of reads classified as human and the percentage of human reads aligning to miRBase did not differ for samples collected in RNAlater versus Zymo Shield (p = 0.12 and p = 0.86, respectively). Furthermore, after multiple testing correction, normalized miRNA counts did not differ significantly between the two preservatives for any of the 42 human miRNAs detected across the eight samples.

It reveals that the SIM is a critical structural element for EPAC1s association with RanBP2/Nup358, a nucleoporin of the cytoplasmic filament component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Mutational disruption of EPAC1 SIM interferes with EPAC1s ability to activate its canonical effectors, small GTPases, Rap1 and Rap2, and non-canonical functions, such as the formation of nuclear condensates and cellular SUMOylation.

Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures, including the full-length BTN3A1-BTN3A2-BTN2A1 complex stabilized by the pAg HMBPP and an HMBPP-primed BTN multimer complex engaged with the V{gamma}9V{delta}2 TCR. The HMBPP-primed BTN3A1-BTN3A2-BTN2A1 complex confirms that this pAg bridges the intracellular B30.2 domains of BTN3A1 and BTN2A1, while also revealing an association of the ectodomains of BTN3A2 and BTN2A1. Upon TCR engagement, the TCR undergoes a substantial conformational change and BTN3A2-BTN2A1 ectodomain interaction dissociates, allowing BTN2A1 to bind to the lateral surface of the V{gamma}9 chain, while BTN3A2 binds to the apical surface of the V{delta}2 chain. Beyond demonstrating that BTN3A2 as a bona fide TCR ligand, this dissociation/binding sequence suggests a ""pliers-like gripping"" mechanism for TCR activation. We also obtained cryo-EM structures of BTN proteins in complex with functional antibodies, further elucidating the overall V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cell activation process. Thus, our structural insights into how BTN proteins sense antigens and drive TCR activation lay the groundwork for developing targeted {gamma}{delta} T cell immunotherapies.",NA,biorxiv

However, most of these models are somewhat limited in their ability to capture cell-to-cell spatial relationships essential for understanding tissue microenvironments. To address this issue, self-supervised learning (SSL) applied to cellular graph models is a promising avenue of investigation as this would afford one the ability to capture cell-level interpretability of the tissue microenvironment and learn relationships from the cellular topology. Compared to SSL on tissue patches, developing cellular graph models requires considerable computation and algorithmic effort, starting with accurate cell detection/segmentation from tissue and then subsequently requiring adequate cell-level feature extraction. In this study, we demonstrate that a pretrained tissue patch encoder, originally trained in the context of the token used in conventional vision transformer frameworks can also serve effectively as a cellular graph encoder for cellbased patches. We report three key findings: 1) the pretrained tissue patch encoder acts as a powerful graph-level feature extractor for cellular graphs in tissue patches; 2) it also can function as a celllevel feature extractor, allowing each cell to be contextualized within its local tissue microenvironment environment; 3) the cell patch size and positional embeddings are critical factors for high-quality cellular graph feature extraction. To validate and support these insights, we evaluate our approach on various tissue region classification tasks from three different types of cancers. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art foundation models in computational pathology. These results highlight the potential of pretrained tissue patch encoders in cellular graph modeling, which can enable insights into how the cellular features and topology are related to various biological processes and phenomena.",NA,biorxiv

While the influence of social presence on behavior has been among the focal points of investigation in social psychology for over a century, its underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by investigating how the presence of conspecifics changes synaptic efficacy from measurements across spatiotemporal brain scales, and how such changes could lead to modulations of task performance in monkeys and humans. In monkeys performing an association learning task, social presence increased excitatory synaptic efficacy in attention-oriented regions dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. In humans performing a visuomotor task, the presence of conspecifics facilitated performance in one of the subject groups, and this facilitation was linked to enhanced excitatory synaptic efficacy within the dorsal and ventral attention networks. We propose that presence-induced improvements in task performance arise from attentional modulation mediated by changes in excitatory synaptic efficacy across three spatiotemporal brain scales, namely, micro-scale (single neurons), meso-scale (cortical columns) and macro-scale (whole-brain). Our findings from Bayesian learning converge to establish a novel, multi-scale framework for understanding the neural underpinnings of social presence effects. This probabilistic framework offers a fresh perspective on social presence research, and lays the groundwork for future investigations into the complex interplay between social presence, neural dynamics, and behavior.",NA,biorxiv

We investigated the effects of exercise has on proteostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans. We utilized a involuntary movement exercise paradigm to investigate acute exercise and the effects of multiple days of exercise on aging and proteostasis, including the autophagy-lysosome system, the proteasome, and neurotoxic peptides. We found that exercise is able to increase proteasomal activity and autophagic flux in vivo, improved resistance to toxic peptides, and increased lifespan. One of the primary rationales for studying the mechanisms of exercise is to uncover potential mediators that can be repurposed to deliver the benefits of exercise to those unable to engage in physical activity. We hypothesized that exercise-elevated metabolite -ketoglutarate, already demonstrated to improve age-related declines in flies and mice, would mimic the effects of exercise on proteostasis.

Most cases of eukaryote HGT reported to date are inter-domain transfers and only few studies have investigated eukaryote-to-eukaryote HGTs. Furthermore, the extent to which HGT has contributed to the gene repertoire of some lineages such as vertebrates remains unclear. Here, we performed a large-scale survey of HGT among 242 species of ray-finned fishes. We found strong evidence supporting 18 teleost-to-teleost HGT events that involve 17 different genes in 11 teleost fish orders. The genes involved in these transfers show lower synonymous divergence than expected under vertical transmission, their phylogeny is inconsistent with that of teleost fishes, and high nucleotide similarity on these genes between donor and recipient lineages extends to non-coding regions. The distribution of HGT events in the teleost tree is heterogenous, with eight of the 18 transfers occurring between the same two orders (Osmeriformes and Clupeiformes). Besides the previously reported transfer of an antifreeze protein, most transferred genes play roles in immunity, suggesting that such genes are more likely than others to confer strong selective advantage to the recipient species. Overall, our work shows that teleost-to-teleost HGT has occurred on multiple occasions and it will be worth further quantifying these transfers and evaluating their impact on teleost evolution as more genomes are being sequenced.",NA,biorxiv

The population activity of grid cells serves as an allocentric representation of the current location of the animal. Recent studies have identified a class of grid cells that represent locations ahead of the animal. How do these predictive representations emerge from the wetware of the MEC? To address this question, we developed a detailed conductance-based model of the MEC network, constrained by existing data on the biophysical properties of stellate cells and the topology of the MEC network. Our model revealed two mechanisms underlying the emergence of a predictive code in the MEC. The first relied on a time scale associated with the HCN conductance. The other depended on the degree of asymmetry in the topology of the MEC network. The former mechanism was sufficient to explain predictive coding in layer II grid cells that represented locations shifted ahead of the current location. The shift was equivalent to ~5% of the diameter of a grid field. The latter mechanism was required to model predictive representations in layer III grid cells that were shifted forward by a distance of ~25% of the diameter of a grid field. A corollary of our model, that the extent of the predictive code changes monotonically along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC following observed changes in the properties of the HCN conductance, is borne out by recent experiments.",NA,biorxiv

In the current study, firstly a FTIR Classifier operating on an IR Biotyper(R) spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) was designed to distinguish between n=36 different Salmonella serogroups. A FTIR classifier is an AI-based tool used in FTIR spectroscopy to analyze and classify different materials based on their infrared spectra.

Secondly, the differentiation performance of this classifier was determined by a thorough external single-lab validation carried out in line with the Guidelines for Validating Species Identifications Using MALDI-ToF-MS issued by the German Federal Office of Consumer Protection for a targeted identification: The most common Salmonella serogroups in Europe, serogroups O:4 (B), O:6,7 (C1), O:8 (C2-C3) and O:9 (D1) were chosen as target parameters and validated using a total of n=1039 infrared absorbance spectra from a total of n=167 strains pertaining to n=39 serogroups. In summary, serogroups O:4, O:6,7 and O:9 perfectly met the adapted guideline requirements and resulted in a >99% inclusivity each. Serogroup O:8 arrived at a 96.1% true-positive rate due to one deviating strain.

Among the myriad of social cues conveyed by the face, emotional signals, known as facial expressions, are paramount not only for humans but also for numerous social animals. The evolution of facial expressions in these animals can also manifest in taxa other than mammals, as suggested by various studies highlighting the socio-ecological benefits of facial expressions. In this study, we elucidated the social function of facial coloration, determined by melanophores, in the neotropical social cichlid Symphysodon aequifasciatus. In this species, facial coloration exhibits instantaneous changes in response to varying social contexts. Through behavioral observations and experimental manipulation, we confirmed that facial coloration in S. aequifasciatus serves to attenuate unnecessary aggressive competition among conspecifics. Furthermore, we observed that the facial area subjected to coloration in this species is innervated by the adenosine triphosphate- and noradrenaline-ergic nervous system. These findings indicated that facial expression in S. aequifasciatus depends on the sympathetic nervous system and has evolved independently of mammalian facial expressions. Our study highlights teleost fishes as valuable animal models for exploring the universality of facial expressions and their underlying cognitive mechanisms in vertebrates.",NA,biorxiv

To build an optogenetic system for controlling endogenous gene expression, we first identified Anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that can inhibit CRISPRa-mediated transcriptional activation in Drosophila. Next, we inserted optogenetic protein LOV2 in these Acrs, tested for their ability to optogenetically modulate endogenous gene upregulation (EnGup) through the CRISPRa-based flySAM system in Drosophila, and found that the photoswitchability of these prototypes was weak. Hence, we engineered an Acr-LOV2 fusion module with refined length of intrinsically disordered and ordered regions (IDR and IOR) and optimized LOV2. This optimized variant, whose application yielded new findings in vivo, was significantly more sensitive for EnGup under blue light than the prototypes. In short, not only does this work introduce the application of Acr proteins in an animal model, but it also provides insights for in vivo characterization of the IDR and the IOR of these small-sized proteins. Together, these findings establish a robust optogenetic toolbox for precise, light-sensitive endogenous gene regulation in Drosophila.

Instead, we hypothesized that humans use frictional instabilities to discriminate between objects. We constructed a set of coated surfaces with physical differences which were imperceptible by touch but created different types of instabilities based on how quickly a finger is slid and how hard a human finger is pressed during sliding. We found that participant accuracy in tactile discrimination most strongly correlated with formations of steady sliding, and response times negatively correlated with stiction spikes. Conversely, traditional metrics like surface roughness or average friction coefficient did not predict tactile discriminability. Identifying the central role of frictional instabilities as an alternative to using friction coefficients should accelerate the design of tactile interfaces for psychophysics and haptics.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we explored the role of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein TMD during viral entry. To do so, we generated a series of amino acid substitutions and insertions within the hydrophobic core of the TMD and analyzed their impact on protein function. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is highly susceptible to changes in its TMD. Furthermore, the TMD sequence and structural parameters relevant for viral entry are distributed across the entire segment, albeit with a stronger implication of the N-terminal portion. The relative orientation of the regions before and after the TMD was also found to be relevant for particle entry.

Participants were drawn from a sample of adolescent twins on two occasions (mean ages 11.5 and 13.2 years, N = 278 and 248).

As the major template of viral transcription, the covalently closed circular DNAs (cccDNAs) of HBV was known to form microchromosomes and interact with various host proteins. In the present study, ZNF638 was found to significantly reduce the transcription of HBV into pgRNAs, and subsequently reduce cccDNA formation and viral propagation. We discovered that ZNF638 was able to bind the preS and S gene regions of HBV, repressing the transcription of cccDNA upon increased modification of H3K9me3 mediated by SETDB1. This epigenetic silencing of cccDNA transcription was further demonstrated to involve the activity of HUSH, a multi-protein complex to mediate epigenetic modifications of histone into suppressed nucleosomes. In in vivo models, we evaluated the effects of ZNF638 deficiency on HBV-targeting siRNA therapy. A significant reduction of the efficacy was observed in animals with reduced ZNF638 expression. In summary, we report that ZNF638 is a potent host factor to repress the transcription of HBV DNAs and to attenuate HBV infection. The role of ZNF638 on HBV repression involves its binding to cccDNA at specific regions for recruiting HUSH complex to write H3K9me3 histone marks for epigenetic silencing. ZNF638 serves as a critical host factor to associate HBV infection and disease progression.

Using predicted sequences for extra-retinal photoreceptors, non-visual opsins were confirmed in the brain, eye, testes, liver, and skin. Specifically, OPN3 (encephalopsin) exhibited the highest expression across all tissues, particularly in the testes, corroborating findings in mammals. OPN5 (neuropsin) was detected predominantly in the testes, marking the first such report in reptiles. Moderate expression of OPN4 (melanopsin) in the brain and eye supports its roles in both visual and deep-brain photoreception. In the skin, a distinct pattern of higher opsin expression was observed in the dorsal skin compared to ventral skin. OPN3-3 was most abundant and exhibited a unique expression profile, potentially linking opsins to light-mediated processes influencing chromatophore-driven color changes.

ACF spaces nucleosomes without de-condensing the chromatin, explaining how ACF maintains nucleosome organization in transcriptionally repressed genomic regions. In contrast, RSC catalyzes ATP-dependent de-condensation of chromatin. Surprisingly, RSC also drives micron-scale movements of entire condensates.

In amniote embryos, primary neurulation occurs through a ""fold-and-fuse"" mechanism by which the edges of the neural plate fuse into the hollow neural tube. Failure of neural fold fusion results in neural tube defects (NTDs), which are among the most devastating and common congenital anomalies worldwide. Unlike amniotes, the zebrafish neural tube develops largely via formation of a solid neural keel that later cavitates to form a midline lumen. Although many aspects of primary neurulation are conserved in zebrafish, including neural fold zippering, it was not clear how well these events resemble analogous processes in amniote embryos. Here, we demonstrate that despite outward differences, zebrafish anterior neurulation closely resembles that of mammals. For the first time in zebrafish embryos, we directly observe enclosure of a lumen by the bilateral neural folds, which fuse by zippering between at least two distinct closure sites. Both the apical constriction that elevates the neural folds and the zippering that fuses them coincide with apical Myosin enrichment. We further show that embryos lacking vangl2, a core planar cell polarity and NTD risk gene, exhibit delayed and abnormal neural fold fusion that fails to enclose a lumen. These defects can also be observed in fixed embryos, enabling their detection without live imaging. Together, our data provide direct evidence for fold-and-fuse neurulation in zebrafish and its disruption upon loss of an NTD risk gene, highlighting the deep conservation of primary neurulation across vertebrates.

This study investigates the impact of autopolyploidy on sporophytic self-incompatibility in plants, a striking example of a genetic system evolving under a special form of balancing selection (strong negative frequency-dependent selection). Numerical simulations reveal that under strict codominance, the number of S-alleles maintained in tetraploid populations is expected to double as compared to diploid populations. However, under a model with strict hierarchical dominance among alleles, the number of S-alleles increases only slightly, but gene diversity and observed heterozygosity are substantially lower in tetraploids as compared to diploids, due to enhanced dominance masking effects. Empirical data on Arabidopsis arenosa and A. lyrata confirm the latter predictions, showing similar levels of allelic diversity but dramatically lower observed and expected heterozygosity at the self-incompatibility locus in tetraploids compared to diploids. The study highlights the significant impact of autopolyploidy on patterns of diversity at the self-incompatibility locus, emphasizing the increased dominance effect in tetraploids.

MTSIV is essential for understanding how telomere-length (TL)-dependent hematopoietic cell division influences age-related health and longevity. By leveraging sex differences in leukocyte TL and the differential dosage of DKC1, a telomerase-regulating gene, during early embryonic cell divisions, we estimate the MTSIV to be 28 base pairs per cell division (95% CI: 23 - 32). Using this estimate and leukocyte TL data from newborns and centenarians, we infer that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo approximately 156 divisions (95% CI: 130-183) over a 100-year lifespan. Using longitudinal data on leukocyte telomere shortening in adults, we further estimate that HSCs divide about 0.97 times yearly (95% CI: 0.80 - 1.13) after age 20. These findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding TL-dependent hematopoiesis, the most proliferative process in the human soma. They also highlight that if telomere shortening affects age-related health and longevity, it acts primarily through its impact on hematopoiesis. Our results refine hematopoietic stem cell replicative history estimates and might guide treatments involving hematopoietic cell expansion, such as hematopoietic cell transplantation and immunotherapies.

Significance StatementWhen human somatic cells divide, their telomeres shorten. This process drives age-related shortening of leukocyte telomeres and reflects hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) division at the top of the hematopoietic hierarchy. The magnitude of telomere shortening per somatic cell division in vivo (MTSIV) is a critical yet previously unquantified parameter essential for providing insights into the pace of HSC division in humans.

Despite the increasing attention in recent years, our understanding of the virulence mechanisms of this pathogen remains limited. In this study, we characterized the predicted genetic determinants of virulence in Bga strain 20GA0385 using reverse genetics approach. Using the closely related rice pathogen, B. glumae as a reference, comparative genomics analysis was performed to identify Bga candidate virulence factors and regulators. Marked and unmarked deletion mutants were generated using allelic exchange and the mutants were functionally validated using in vitro and in vivo assays. The role of mutants in pathogenic phenotypes was analyzed using onion foliar/seedling necrosis assays, the Red Scale Necrosis (RSN) assay and in planta bacterial population counts. The phytotoxin toxoflavin was a major contributor to foliar necrosis and bacterial populations whereas the type II and type III secretion system (T2SS/T3SS) were dispensable for foliar symptoms. In onion scale tissue, the T2SS single mutant gspC and its double and triple mutant derivatives all contributed to scale lesion area. Neither the lipocyclopeptide icosalide, toxoflavin, nor T3SS were required for scale symptoms. Our results suggest the quorum sensing tofIMR system in Bga regulates, toxoflavin, T2SS, and T3SS, contributing to onion symptom production. We show different virulence factors contribute to onion tissue-specific virulence patterns in Bga and that decreases in scale symptoms often do not result in decreased Bga populations in onion tissue.",NA,biorxiv

We present three complementary approaches for predicting epitope relationships from antibody amino acid sequences. First, we analyze [~]18 million antibody pairs targeting [~]250 protein families and establish that a threshold of >70% CDRH3 sequence identity among antibodies sharing both heavy and light chain V-genes reliably predicts overlapping-epitope antibody pairs. Next, we develop a supervised contrastive fine-tuning framework for antibody large language models which results in embeddings that better correlate with epitope information than those from pre-trained models. Applying this contrastive learning approach to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain antibodies, we achieve 82.7% balanced accuracy in distinguishing same-epitope versus different-epitope antibody pairs and demonstrate the ability to predict relative levels of structural overlap from learning on functional epitope bins (Spearman{rho} = 0.25). Finally, we create AbLang-PDB, a generalized model for predicting overlapping-epitope antibodies for a broad range of protein families. AbLang-PDB achieves five-fold improvement in average precision for predicting overlapping-epitope antibody pairs compared to sequence-based methods, and effectively predicts the amount of epitope overlap among overlapping-epitope pairs ({rho} = 0.81). In an antibody discovery campaign searching for overlapping-epitope antibodies to the HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody 8ANC195, 70% of computationally selected candidates demonstrated HIV-1 specificity, with 50% showing competitive binding with 8ANC195.

Early-stage AD is associated with cortical hyperexcitability, whereas later stages exhibit oscillatory slowing and hypoactivity, a progression observable in electrophysiological spectral characteristics. While previous studies have linked these changes to the dysfunction of fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons and neuronal loss associated with amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and hyperphos-phorylated tau (hp-{tau}) pathology, the precise mechanistic relationship between cellular and altered electrophysiology remains unclear. To study this relationship, we employed a Laminar Neural Mass Model that integrates excitatory and inhibitory neural populations within a biophysically informed columnar framework. The connectivity constant from PV cells to pyramidal neurons was gradually reduced to simulate the progressive neurotoxic effects of A{beta} oligomers. Other model parameters were systematically varied to compare with existing modeling literature and also to simulate the effects of hp-{tau}. All model predictions were compared to empirical M/EEG findings in the literature. Our simulations of PV interneuron dysfunction successfully reproduced the biphasic electrophysiological progression observed in AD: an early phase of hyperexcitability with increased gamma and alpha power, followed by oscillatory slowing and reduced spectral power. Alternative mechanisms and model parameters, such as increased excitatory drive, failed to replicate the observed biomarker trajectory. Additionally, to reconcile the hypoactivity and decreased firing rates observed in advanced AD stages, we combined the PV dysfunction model with a disruption of the pyramidal cell populations that reflects the neurotoxicity induced by hp-{tau}. Although this additional mechanism is not necessary to reproduce oscillatory changes in the isolated neural mass, it is crucial for aligning the model with evidence of reduced firing rates, metabolic activity, and cell loss and will enhance its applicability in future whole-brain modeling studies. These results support the hypothesis that at the local level, PV interneuron dysfunction is a primary driver of cortical electrophysiological alterations, while pyramidal neuron loss underlies later-stage severe hypoactivity. Our model provides a mechanistic framework for interpreting excitation-inhibition imbalance across AD progression, demonstrating the value of biophysically constrained models for interpreting electrophysiological biomarkers.

Author summaryAlzheimers disease (AD) is not just a disorder of memory--it is a disease of brain networks. Before widespread neuronal loss occurs, the brain enters a state of hyperexcitability, which may contribute to disease progression. This hyperactivity is thought to arise from the selective dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons, particularly parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, which play a crucial role in maintaining balanced brain activity. However, as the disease advances, a dramatic shift occurs, with neurons becoming progressively less active, leading to network breakdown. Understanding how this transition unfolds is essential for identifying new targets for early intervention.

In this study, we developed a computational model of AD that represents the effects of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) oligomers and hyperphosphorylated tau (hp-{tau}) on neural circuits in a biologically meaningful way. Our model reproduces key features of M/EEG biomarkers, demonstrating that PV interneuron dysfunction leads to early hyperexcitability and the electrophysiological oscillatory changes characteristic of AD, while pyramidal cell pathology is necessary to drive later hypoactivity and network failure.

By bridging molecular pathology mechanisms with mesoscale neural activity, our model provides a powerful tool for studying AD-related circuit dysfunction. It also highlights the importance of PV interneurons as a potential therapeutic target, paving the way for biologically informed interventions that could alter the course of the disease.",NA,biorxiv

We further found that ECT stimulation pulse parameters and electrode configuration directly shaped the wave dynamics of seizure and subsequent CSD. To translate these findings to human patients, we tested for the presence of hemodynamic signatures of post-ictal CSD using non-invasive diffuse optical monitoring of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation during routine ECT treatments. We found evidence that humans generate hyperemic waves after ECT seizure which are highly consistent with CSD.

GEO supports queries based on keywords, ontology terms, and other annotations. However, reviewing these results is time-consuming and tedious, and it often misses relevant datasets. We hypothesized that language models could address this problem by summarizing dataset descriptions as numeric representations (embeddings). Assuming a researcher has previously found some relevant datasets, we evaluated the potential to find additional relevant datasets. For six human medical conditions, we used 30 models to generate embeddings for datasets that human curators had previously associated with the conditions and identified other datasets with the most similar descriptions. This approach was often, but not always, more effective than GEOs search engine.

A large fraction of genes found to promote CD98 expression in this screen are involved in secretory and other vesicles, including subunits of the V-type ATPase complex. Genetic ablation and chemical inhibition of V-type ATPases in myeloma cells and primary plasma cells, respectively, reduced antibody secretion. Mouse and human long-lived plasma cells had greater numbers of acidified vesicles than their short-lived counterparts, and this correlated with increased antibody secretory capacity. The screen also revealed a requirement for the signaling adapter MYD88 in CD98 expression. Plasma cell-specific deletion of Myd88 led to reduced survival and antibody secretion by antigen-specific cells in vivo and unresponsiveness to BAFF and APRIL ex vivo.

However, recent machine learning (ML) approaches to estimating recombination have used pooled sequencing data, which does not sample individual genotypes and cannot be used to calculate disequilibria beyond the length of a single sequence read. Motivated by these results, this study examines the ""black box"" of such ML methods to understand what signals are being used to infer recombination rates. We find that it is indeed possible to estimate recombination solely using the allele frequency spectrum, and we provide a genealogical interpretation of these results. We further show that even a simplified representation of the allele frequency spectrum can be used to estimate recombination. We demonstrate the accuracy of such inferences using both simulations and data from humans. These results offer a new way to understand the effects of recombination on patterns of sequence data, as well as providing an example of how the internal workings of ML methods can give insight into biological processes.

However, the mechanisms of eudoxid production and its evolutionary origins are unknown. Using live imaging, immunohistochemistry and pharmacological inhibition we provide a mechanistic understanding of eudoxid formation. We demonstrate that eudoxid release is controlled by a dedicated muscle and involves tissue remodeling, leading to the formation of an integrated dispersive unit with specific behaviors and different buoyancy.

Although most COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or mild, severe infections requiring hospitalization have resulted in likely more than 14 million cumulative deaths to date. One hallmark of severe COVID-19 is a dysregulated immune response that leads to systemic inflammation and contributes to disease severity and mortality but is not explained by viral replication alone. Severe COVID-19 has been shown to disrupt the gut microbiome and increase intestinal permeability which may contribute to immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation. In this study, we investigated the differences in plasma biomarkers for microbial translocation and gut barrier damage as well as circulating cytokines between healthy volunteers and patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We then performed a correlation analysis to understand how the relationships between these plasma biomarkers differed and used a random forest model to assess their accuracy in distinguishing between these two groups. Our results demonstrated that hospitalized COVID-19 patients have elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of microbial translocation, and that the relationships between these biomarkers were significantly altered compared to healthy volunteers, especially those related to the mucosal associated homeostatic cytokines IL-17A and IL-23.

Studies of old virus sequences have mainly relied on DNA or on RNA from fixed or frozen samples. The millions of specimens in natural history museums represent a potential treasure trove of old virus sequences, but it is not clear how well RNA survives in old samples. We experimentally assessed the stability of RNA in insects stored dry at room temperature over 72 weeks. Although RNA molecules grew fragmented, RNA yields remained surprisingly constant. RT-qPCR of host and virus RNA showed minimal differences between dried and frozen specimens. To assess RNA survival in much older samples we acquired Drosophila specimens from North American entomological collections. We recovered sequences from known and novel viruses including several coding complete virus genomes from a fly collected in 1908. We found that the virome of D. melanogaster has changed little over the past century. Galbut virus, the most prevalent virus infection in contemporary D. melanogaster, was also the most common in historic samples. Finally, we investigated the genomic and physical features of surviving RNA. RNA that survived was fragmented, chemically damaged, and preferentially double stranded or contained in ribonucleoprotein complexes. This showed that RNA - especially certain types of RNA - can survive in biological specimens over extended periods in the absence of fixation or freezing and confirms the utility of dried specimens to provide a clearer understanding of virus evolution.",NA,biorxiv

In this study, we aimed to investigate if the injection of Pig Plasma Extracellular Particles (PPEPs) into rats would produce an acute immune or toxic reaction.

MethodsBlood from a young pig was collected, PPEPs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography and injected into young male Sprague-Dawley rats, while the control group received a sterile saline injection. After 9 days, the animals were euthanized and their organs were histologically analyzed for signs of cellular damage or immune infiltration.

ResultsThe treated rats showed no signs of acute immunological reaction, behaving normally immediately after the injections and during the 9 days since the first injection. Throughout the trial period, the animals continued gaining weight normally and the histological analysis of their liver, kidney and spleen showed no signs of acute toxicity.

Phelipanche ramosa and P. aegyptiaca (broomrapes) cause severe damage to field-grown tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Strigolactones (SLs), apocarotenoid phytohormones, play a critical role in plant physiology and development, and are also the primary signals that trigger the germination of parasitic weed seeds. We generated CRISPR/Cas9 tomato knock-out lines for the SlD27 gene, as well as three other key genes involved in SL biosynthesis (SlCCD7, SlCCD8, SlMAX1), all within the same genetic background. The edited lines exhibited a marked reduction in SL content in root exudates, along with impaired broomrape seed germination. A comprehensive analysis of morphological, reproductive, and fruit-related traits revealed gene-specific effects on plant phenotype, including vegetative traits, fruit set, fruit development, and volatilome. Specifically, the knock-out of two CCDs and the MAX1 had a specific impact not only on plant development but also on the production of volatile organic compounds during fruit ripening. In contrast, the Sld27 lines, produced for the first time in this study, displayed a phenotype similar to the control non-edited plants, suggesting that the D27 gene holds promise as a breeding target for enhancing resistance to parasitic weeds in tomato.

We utilise a systematic chimaera approach to define the differential functionality of two closely related Medicago truncatula SCAR proteins in plant development. We show that SCAR/WAVE contribution to Medicago truncatula root hair or Arabidopsis thaliana trichome formation is dependent on two central intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Differential functionalities of Medicago truncatula SCAR proteins were furthermore associated with the presence/absence of a 42-amino acid sequence within the IDR that impacted protein stability.

However, identifying reliable predictive biomarkers for ICI response remains a significant challenge. In this study, we analyzed real-world cohorts of advanced NSCLC and MIBC patients treated with ICIs as first-line therapy. Tumor samples underwent Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) to identify specific somatic variants and assess tumor mutational burden (TMB). Additionally, mutational signature extraction and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to uncover the underlying mechanisms of ICI response. We also characterized HLA-I haplotypes and investigated LINE-1 retrotransposition. Distinct mutation patterns were identified in patients who responded to treatment, suggesting potential biomarkers for predicting ICI effectiveness. In NSCLC, tumor mutational burden (TMB) did not differ significantly between responders and non-responders, while in MIBC, higher TMB was linked to better responses. Specific mutational signatures and HLA haplotypes were associated with ICI response in both cancers. Pathway analysis showed that NSCLC responders had active inflammatory and immune pathways, while non-responders had pathways such related to FGFR3 and neural crest differentiation associated to resistance mechanisms. In MIBC, responders had alterations in DNA repair, leading to more neoantigens and a stronger ICI response.

Consequently, new strategies are being explored to disrupt cholesterol homeostasis more comprehensively by inhibiting its synthesis and intracellular transport. This study investigates a previously under-explored function of PI5P4Ks, which catalyzes the conversion of PI(5)P to PI(4,5)P2 at intracellular membranes.

We paired each transect location with climatic, topographic, atmospheric, and soil metrics to investigate regional-level environmental drivers of large tree density using spatial modeling. Water availability and stable climatic conditions (low incidence of storms and of lightning) were the main drivers of tall-tree density at the regional level. The occurrence of tall trees is aggregated along the Amazon, with 14% occurring within 1.3% of the Amazon and 50% concentrated in 11.2% of the area.

It is a known carcinogen and hematopoietic toxin; however, little is known about benzenes potential atherogenicity.

HypothesisInhaled benzene induces atherogenesis by increasing vascular inflammation in LDL receptor Knockout (LDLR-KO) mice.

MethodsMale LDLR-KO mice were exposed to HEPA-filtered air or benzene (1 ppm, 6h/day, 5days/week) for 24 weeks. For the last 12 weeks of exposure, the mice were maintained on a western diet. The single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) of aortae was performed at Novogene. For in vitro experiments, splenic naive T cells were exposed to 1 {micro}M of hydroquinone (HQ) for 24 hours, and intracellular ROR-gamma levels were measured by flow cytometry.

ResultsBenzene inhalation increased the aortic valve lesion area by more than 25% (P<0.05) in LDLR-KO mice. Using snRNAseq, eleven major cell types were detected, including T cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Benzene increased the number of T cells by 2.5-fold, proliferating T-cells by 5.8-fold, and VSMC by 1.6-fold, suggesting increased cellularity and reduced plaque stability. In addition, benzene upregulated Th17 polarization marker Rorc and negative regulators of apoptosis Rag1 and Bcl11b while significantly attenuating the expression of proliferation inhibitor Ms4a4b in T cells. In VSMC, benzene downregulated extracellular matrix organization genes and upregulated platelet degranulation pathways. Polarization of T cells into Th17 was confirmed by HQ-dependent upregulation of ROR-gamma in vitro.

ConclusionOur data suggest that inhaled benzene exposure compromises plaque cellularity and stability by facilitating T-cell proliferation and polarization, which coincides with the degradation of smooth muscle extracellular matrix and platelet activation.",NA,biorxiv

To understand the basis for this, we determined a 3 [A] resolution structure of human SPIN90-Arp2/3 complex nucleating actin filaments. Our structure shows that SPIN90 dimerises via a 3-helix bundle and interacts with two Arp2/3 complexes. Each SPIN90 molecule binds both Arp2/3 complexes to promote their activation.

The MHb-IPN pathway has been implicated in the regulation of fear behavior and nicotine addiction. The synapses between the ventral MHb and the IPN show a unique property, i.e., an enhancement of synaptic transmission upon activation of GABAB receptors. This GABAB receptor-mediated potentiation of ventral MHb-IPN synaptic transmission has been implicated in regulating fear memory. Although IPN is known to contain parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) GABAergic neurons and vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3)-expressing neurons, it is unknown how GABAB receptor activation affects ventral MHb-mediated glutamatergic transmission onto these three subtypes of IPN neurons. Our studies show robust glutamatergic connectivity from ventral MHb to PV and SST neurons in the IPN, while the ventral MHb-mediated glutamatergic transmission in IPN VGLUT3 neurons is weak. Although activation of GABAB receptors produces a robust potentiation of ventral MHb-mediated glutamatergic transmission in PV neurons, we observed a modest effect in IPN SST neurons. Despite the diminished basal synaptic transmission between ventral MHb and IPN VGLUT3 neurons, activation of GABAB receptors causes transient conversion of non-responding ventral MHb synapses into active synapses in some IPN VGLUT3 neurons. Thus, our results show strong ventral MHb connectivity to GABAergic IPN neurons compared to VGLUT3-expressing IPN neurons. Furthermore, GABAB receptor activation produces a differential effect on ventral MHb-mediated glutamatergic transmission onto PV, SST, and VGLUT3 neurons in the IPN.",NA,biorxiv

Previous studies in our lab have shown that administration of OT into the fourth ventricle (4V; hindbrain) elicits weight loss and stimulates interscapular brown adipose tissue temperature (TIBAT) in DIO rats. We hypothesized that OT-elicited stimulation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation of IBAT contributes to its ability to activate BAT and reduce BW in DIO rats. To test this, we determined the effect of disrupting SNS activation of IBAT on OT-elicited stimulation of TIBAT and reduction of BW in DIO rats. We first confirmed that bilateral surgical SNS denervation to IBAT was successful based on having achieved [&ge;] 60% reduction in IBAT norepinephrine (NE) content from DIO rats. NE content was selectively reduced in IBAT by 94.7 {+/-} 2.7, 96.8 {+/-} 1.8 and 85.9 {+/-} 6.1% (P<0.05) at 1, 6 and 7-weeks post-denervation, respectively, and was unchanged in liver or inguinal white adipose tissue. We then measured the impact of bilateral surgical SNS denervation to IBAT on the ability of acute 4V OT (1, 5 {micro}g) to stimulate TIBAT in DIO rats. We found that the high dose of 4V OT (5 {micro}g) stimulated TIBAT similarly between sham and denervated rats (P=NS) and that the effects of 4V OT to stimulate TIBAT did not require beta-3 adrenergic receptor signaling. We subsequently measured the effect of bilateral surgical denervation of IBAT on the effect of chronic 4V OT (16 nmol/day) or vehicle infusion to reduce BW, adiposity, and energy intake in DIO rats. Chronic 4V OT reduced BW gain by -7.2 {+/-} 9.6 g and -14.1 {+/-} 8.8 g in sham and denervated rats (P<0.05 vs vehicle treatment), respectively, and this effect was similar between groups (P=NS). These effects were associated with reductions in adiposity and energy intake (P<0.05). Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that sympathetic innervation of IBAT is not required for central OT to increase BAT thermogenesis and reduce BW gain and adiposity in male DIO rats.",NA,biorxiv

This study examined the persistent effects of traumatic stress exposure on sensitivity to alcohol and underlying neurobiological mechanisms in rats.

MethodsMale (N=98) and female (N=98) Long-Evans rats were exposed to the predator odor TMT, and two weeks later, molecular, neuronal, and behavioral sensitivity to alcohol were assessed. Next, rats were trained to discriminate alcohol from water (male N=70; female N=56), and the impact of TMT on interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol and the alcohol-like effects of systemic GABAA receptor activation were evaluated. Lastly, functional involvement of GABAA and NMDA receptors in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) and the anterior insular cortex (aIC) was investigated.

ResultsTMT exposure sex-dependently altered PrL Gabra1, and elevated aIC Grin2b and Grin2c in males. TMT increased PrL c-Fos in males, which was attenuated by alcohol administration. Alcohol-induced locomotor and startle response effects were attenuated in the TMT group in both sexes. TMT exposure potentiated interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol in males but not in females, and this effect was driven by GABAA receptors in the PrL. Greater stress reactivity during TMT exposure was associated with higher interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol, and alcohol exposure history was linked to a heightened stress response to TMT in males.

ConclusionsTraumatic stress increased interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol in males, but not females, through PrL GABAA receptor adaptations, potentially enhancing the stimulatory, and by extension the rewarding, effects of alcohol.",NA,biorxiv

Using simple tasks requiring rapid evaluation of a stationary sensory feature, two human neurophysiological signals have been found to evolve with similar integration dynamics, with one (centroparietal positivity; CPP) appearing to compute the running integral and continuously feed it to the other (motor beta lateralisation; MBL). However, it remains unknown whether and how these signals serve more distinct functional roles in more complex scenarios where information arrives discontinuously and requires more computational steps to form appropriate belief updates. We employed a volatile expanded judgement task that permits dissociation of the encoding of raw sensory information in each of a series of discrete stimuli ( objective evidence), the appropriately transformed belief updates from that information ( effective evidence), and the evolving belief itself (accumulated evidence). Whereas MBL traced the evolving belief across stimuli, the CPP was found only to locally encode the effective evidence associated with each individual stimulus. Furthermore, fluctuations in CPP amplitude after each single stimulus could account for variability in the encoding of accumulated evidence in MBL. These results suggest a flexible computational hierarchy in which effective evidence can be computed sample-by-sample at an intermediate processing level to drive downstream belief updates for protracted decisions about discrete stimuli.",10.1038/s41467-025-58861-9,biorxiv

However, these approaches can be time-consuming and constrained by the limited chemical space they explore. Recent advances in OR structural understanding, coupled with scientific breakthroughs in protein structure prediction, have facilitated the application of structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) techniques for accelerated ligand discovery. Here, we report the first successful application of SBVS to insect ORs. We developed a unique workflow that combines molecular docking predictions, in vivo validation and behavioral assays to identify new behaviorally active volatiles for non-pheromonal receptors. This work serves as a proof of concept, laying the groundwork for future studies and highlighting the need for improved computational approaches.

These haustoria also secrete a large number of proteins, some of which remain in the matrix surrounding the haustoria while others are translocated through a membrane into the cytoplasm of the plant cell. These latter proteins would be expected to possess a signature marking them out for translocation but, to date, no such signature has been identified. An examination of a set of wheat rust proteins known to be translocated to the cytoplasm of the wheat cell, together with an analysis of 1208 wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) secretome proteins, provides evidence that the translocation signature contains two components. The first component consists of a positively-charged amino acid at position 1, 2 or 3 (and possibly 4 or greater) upstream of the hydrophobic region in the signal peptide. The second component consists of a positively-charged amino acid at position 21 downstream of the signal peptide. A similar analysis of flax rust (Melampsora lini) secretome proteins indicates that the first component is the same as that of the wheat stem rust secretome proteins but that the second component consists of a positively-charged amino acid at position (16)17-20 downstream of the signal peptide. The flax rust signature may also be employed by wheat stem rust in its pycnial stage when growing on its alternate dicot host, barberry. Being able to identify which rust haustorial secreted proteins go to the plant cytoplasm and which to the extrahaustorial matrix should facilitate work aimed at identifying the function of each of the secreted proteins and, also, work aimed at elucidating the translocation mechanism, an understanding of which could open up new approaches to rust control.",NA,biorxiv

There are several emerging techniques to measure dynamic FC, adding new perspectives to well-studied static FC networks. Recent dynamic FC studies suggest that adult resting state networks are driven by key moments of dynamic activity rather than sustained correlations. Co-activation pattern (CAP) analysis leverages this theory, clustering high-activity frames to identify recurring configurations of significant activity. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) is an infant-friendly modality that measures hemodynamic changes in the cortex. HD-DOT has been used to investigate static FC in term-aged infants. The CAP approach is a promising avenue to examine dynamic FC in neonates, but it is yet untested in neonatal HD-DOT. This study validates the CAP approach for neonatal HD-DOT and presents novel decompositions of neonate FC networks.

HD-DOT data were acquired from a cohort of sleeping term newborns at the Rosie Hospital, Cambridge UK (n = 44, postmenstrual age = 40+3 (range: 38+2 - 42+6) weeks). The top 15% of seed-selected frames were clustered using the K-means algorithm for three regions of interest (ROIs: frontal, central, and parietal) to identify significant seed-associated patterns of co-activation or co-deactivation. These patterns (CAPs) were characterized using four metrics: consistency, fractional occupancy, dwell time, and transition likelihood.

Distinct CAPs were identified for frontal, central, and parietal regions of interest. These CAPs had high consistency scores, validating the efficacy of the CAP methodology for newborn HD-DOT. The CAP decomposition revealed significant patterns obscured by static analysis. Several neonate CAPs illustrate frontoparietal activity, potentially reflecting early default mode network activity, which is immature and modular for the first year after birth.

This work demonstrates the utility of CAP analysis with newborn HD-DOT and provides new insight into brain dynamics of early resting state networks.",NA,biorxiv

Using this method, we revealed that selection primarily occurs within a narrow developmental window during germline cysts differentiation. At this stage, the proportion of the deleterious mtDNA variant decreases without a reduction in its absolute copy number. Instead, the healthier mtDNA variant replicates more frequently, thereby outcompeting the co-existing deleterious variant.

Here, we test post-catastrophic climate impacts on barley, maize, rice, and sorghum, four crops with extensive landrace cultivation, under a range of nuclear war scenarios that differ in the amount of black carbon aerosol (soot) injected into the climate model. We used a crop growth model to estimate gradients of environmental stressors that drive local adaptation. We then fit genotype environment associations using high density genomic markers with gradient forest offset (GF offset) methods and predicted maladaptation through time. As a validation, we found that our GF models successfully predicted local adaptation of maize landraces in multiple common gardens across Mexico. We found strong concordance between GF offset and disruptions in climate, and landraces of all tested crop species were predicted to be the most maladapted across space and time where soot-induced climate change was the greatest. We further used our GF models to identify landrace varieties best matched to specific post-catastrophic conditions, indicating potential substitutions for agricultural resilience. We found the best landrace genotype was often far away or in another nation, though countries with more climatic diversity had better within-country substitutions. Our results highlight that a soot-producing catastrophe would result in the global maladaptation of landraces and suggest that current landrace adaptive diversity is insufficient for agricultural resilience in the case of the soot scenarios with the greatest change to climate.",10.1038/s41467-025-59488-6,biorxiv

The convergence of hypervirulence with antibiotic resistance is now a major global health threat. Using a murine pulmonary infection model, we show that hvKp resisted clearance despite significant neutrophil recruitment. Using clinical hvKp and cKp isolates, bone marrow derived neutrophils, cell biology, pharmacology and imaging (both light and electron microscopy) in ex vivo assays revealed that the hvKp hypermucoviscous capsule prevents bacterial recognition and neutrophil activation, blocking ROS production, degranulation, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation. In the absence of capsule ({Delta}wcaJ) or hypermucoid capsule determinants ({Delta}rmpADC), hvKp activates neutrophils, leading to degranulation, NET formation and bacterial killing. While superimposing the absence of O-antigen ({Delta}rfb) on the {Delta}wcaJ abrogates degranulation, neutrophils still elaborate NETs that eliminate the {Delta}wcaJ/{Delta}rfb mutant at high efficiency. This suggests that O-antigen is a double-edged sword, functioning as a PAMP triggering neutrophil degranulation yet assisting the pathogen to evade NET-mediated destruction.

While previous neuroimaging studies have identified neural correlates of LSS integration across different stages of reading development, the specific neural signatures underlying automatic LSS integration remain unclear. In the present study, we aimed to isolate neural components specifically associated with automatic LSS integration in literate adults. To this end, we developed an artificial script training paradigm in which adult native Finnish speakers were taught to associate unfamiliar foreign letters with familiar Finnish speech sounds. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we directly compared the audiovisual processing of newly learned and overlearned LSS associations within the same task, one day after training. Event-related fields (ERFs) and multivariate decoding revealed largely shared neural circuits of audiovisual integration for both types of LSS associations, as evidenced by multisensory interaction and congruency effects. Interestingly, the processing of congruent overlearned audiovisual associations uniquely recruited brain activity in the left parietal cortex during the 235-475 ms time window. Furthermore, temporal generalization analysis of the congruency effects revealed that while both newly learned and overlearned audiovisual associations engaged common neural mechanisms, the newly learned associations were processed systematically more slowly by a few hundred milliseconds.

We investigated the proteome of autologous and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) sEVs for their potential to contribute to cell and tissue homeostasis in this niche.

MethodsWe aimed to identify characteristics of NP sEVs via mass spectrometric proteome and functional enrichment analysis. We explored the proteome profile of sEVs generated by autologous parent cell lines from bovine coccygeal IVD and adipose tissue, with a focus on NP cells, using adult and fetal donors. We compared these findings to published sEV databases and MSC sEV data.

To study the latter, previous studies have mainly evaluated how MCs can influence melanomas/melanoma cells. However, the inverse scenario, i.e., whether melanoma/melanoma cells might impact on MCs has received less attention. Here we investigated this issue and show that melanoma cell-conditioned medium had a strong growth-inhibitory impact on MCs, which was attributed to inhibition of MC proliferation combined with induction of apoptosis. Further, our data indicate that such effects were attributable to melanin present in the melanoma cell-conditioned medium, as similar anti-proliferative effects were seen in response to both free melanin and to melanocores enriched from melanoma-conditioned medium. Melanin did not reduce the expression of MC markers, but was shown to impair MC activation. We also demonstrate that melanin is taken up by MCs, both in cultured MCs and in vivo in melanoma tumors, and it was observed that melanin, after uptake, can be found in the MC nucleus. Further, we show that melanin had marked effects on the nuclear morphology in MCs accompanied by clipping of core histone 3, and it is demonstrated that these events were dependent on translocation of tryptase, a granule-localized protease, into the MC nucleus. Tryptase was also shown to affect the mechanism of melanin-induced cell death.

A popular exploratory approach applies mass-univariate statistics followed by cluster-sum inferences, an effective way to correct for multiple comparisons while preserving high statistical power by pooling together neighbouring effects. However, these cluster-based methods have an important limitation: each cluster is associated with a unique p value, such that there is no error control at individual time points, and one must be cautious about interpreting when and where effects start and end. Sassenhagen & Draschkow (2019) provided an important reminder of this limitation. They also reported results from a simulation, suggesting that onsets estimated from EEG data are both positively biased and very variable. However, the simulation lacked comparisons to other methods. Here I report such comparisons in a new simulation, replicating the positive bias of the cluster-sum method, but also demonstrating that it performs relatively well, in terms of bias and variability, compared to other methods that provide point-wise p values: two methods that control the false discovery rate, and two methods that control the family-wise error rate (cluster-depth and maximum statistic methods).

Although early interventions can improve patient outcomes, they also lead to side effects. Therefore, the early prediction of stroke outcomes is crucial for clinical strategies. Imaging markers such as brain swelling volume and midline shift have been critical predictors in various stroke scoring systems. However, these markers can only become visible on brain images days after stroke onset, which delays clinical decisions. A primary challenge in predicting these markers is that brain swelling is a biomechanical process that relies on anatomical features, such as lesion size and location. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel computational pipeline to predict brain swelling after stroke. We first provide a mathematical model of the brain by using a five-compartment poroelastic theory. It allows us to generate high-quality stroke cases with varied 3D brain and lesion anatomy, which are then used to train and validate a deep neural network (DNN). Our in silico experimentation with 3,000 cases shows that anatomical features of stroke brains are well-learned by the DNN, with minimal errors in brain swelling prediction found in the hold-out testing cases. In addition, we used the DNN to process clinical imaging data of 60 stroke patients. The results show that the markers generated from the DNN can predict 3-month stroke outcomes with an AUC of around 0.7. It indicates that the proposed computational pipeline can potentially advance the time point for clinical decisions.

Significance StatementStroke is the second leading cause of death in the world, and malignant stroke can lead to a death rate of 80%. Early interventions can improve patient outcomes but can also cause side effects. Therefore, it is crucial to predict stroke outcomes at an early stage. Radiological markers such as brain swelling volume and midline shift have been used in various stroke scoring systems. However, these markers can only become visible after days to stroke onset, which delays clinical decisions. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel computational pipeline to predict brain swelling after stroke onset. The proposed pipeline is found to predict brain swelling accurately and can potentially assist early clinical decision-making.",NA,biorxiv

In this study, we developed models to predict overall survival using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides from FFPE samples in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). By validating our models across diverse squamous tumor entities, including, head and neck (HR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.17-2.12, p = 0.003), esophageal (non-significant), lung (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.13-1.52, p < 0.001) and cervical (HR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.10-1.75, p = 0.005) squamous cell carcinomas, we showed that the predicted risk score captures relevant information for survival beyond HNSCC. Correlation analysis indicated that the predicted risk score is strongly associated with various clinical factors, including human papillomavirus status, tumor volume and smoking history, although the specific factors vary across cohorts.

Since its introduction 30 years ago, the method of using plasticine prey to quantify predation pressure has become increasingly popular in biology. However, recent studies have questioned the accuracy of the method, suggesting that misinterpretation of predator bite marks and the artificiality of the models may bias the results. Yet, bias per se might not be a methodological issue as soon as its statistical distribution in the samples is even, quantifiable, and thus correctable in quantitative analyses. In this study, we focus on avian predation of lepidopteran larvae models, which is one of the most extensively studied predator-prey interactions across diverse ecosystems worldwide. We compared bird predation on plasticine caterpillar models to that on dead caterpillars of similar size and color, using camera traps to assess actual predation events and to evaluate observer accuracy in identifying predation marks a posteriori. The question of whether plasticine models reliably measure insectivorous bird predation remained unanswered, for two reasons: (1) even the evaluation of experienced observers in the posterior assessment of predation marks on plasticine models was subjective to some extent, and (2) camera traps failed to reflect predation rates as assessed by observers, partly because they could only record evidence of bird presence rather than actual predation events. Camera traps detected more evidence of bird presence than predation clues on plasticine models, suggesting that fake prey may underestimate the foraging activity of avian insectivores. The evaluation of avian predation on real caterpillar corpses was probably also compromised by losses to other predators, likely ants. Given the uncertainties and limitations revealed by this study, and in the current absence of more effective monitoring methods, it remains simpler, more cost-effective, ethical, and reliable to keep using plasticine models to assess avian predation. However, it is important to continue developing improved monitoring technologies to better evaluate and refine these methods in order to advance research in this field.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we reveal that eosinophils actively shape the tumor microenvironment and influence metastatic progression. Using comprehensive transcriptomics analysis of human CRC and a murine orthotopic tumor model, we identify a conserved tumor-specific eosinophil signature and activation profile. Despite their declining presence in advanced CRC, eosinophils suppress metastatic dissemination by counteracting the pro-tumorigenic functions of SPP1+ macrophages - a subset linked to immune exclusion and tumor metastasis. Mechanistically, eosinophils respond to tumor-derived signals and inhibit macrophage differentiation into SPP1+ cells. Eosinophil depletion exacerbates peritoneal tumor spread.

Quantifying how constrained by epistasis (and thus rugged) a fitness landscape is when data is combinatorially incomplete, however, remains challenging. Here, we propose a spectral graph theory approach to measure fitness landscape ruggedness as the characteristic time step of a heat diffusion process. Our approach is conceptually analogous to modelling a fitness signal as heat and measuring the ruggedness of the fitness landscape as the length of time that signal has diffused over a network graph for. Through theory and simulation, we show that our diffusion-based approach describes the global ruggedness of a fitness landscape, even when only a fraction of the fitness map is experimentally characterized. Applying this approach to empirical fitness landscapes that encompass deep mutational scans, combinatorially complete datasets, and sparse sampling of homologous sequences, we find large variation in ruggedness both among and within different protein folds and functions. Finally, we use spectral graph theory to demonstrate that ruggedness is intimately related to the fraction of sequence space that maintains sufficient fitness to overcome purifying selection, which we term the solution set of the fitness function. These findings offer a theoretically grounded explanation for why complex biophysical traits often exhibit strong epistasis, while simpler traits, such as fold stability, evolve over smooth fitness landscapes. Our results underscore how spectral methods can help unify and quantify the interplay between fitness constraints and evolutionary outcomes in protein sequence space.",NA,biorxiv

In France, it was first detected in birds in 2015, but during summer 2018 the spread of USUV was particularly significant throughout the country, killing mainly common blackbirds (Turdus merula) and to a lesser extent great grey owls (Strix nebulosa), among other captive and non-captive wild bird species. Previous studies of USUV in France have focused on reconstructing pathways of introduction, but not on structural aspects of virus spread within the country. Data (RT-PCR of geolocated dead birds) on this 2018 outbreak were collected through both an event-based wildlife network named SAGIR and the health surveillance of the French-speaking Association of Zoo Veterinarians (AFVPZ). In addition, common blackbird populations could be monitored through another network (REZOP). Statistical analysis (spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal and environmental determinants) of the SAGIR and AFVPZ network data helped to highlight the early appearance of separate large clusters of USUV cases in mid-July 2018, the subsequent diffusion into smaller and secondary clusters at the end of August 2018, and a meanwhile enlargement of the first clusters with an increase in the number of cases. High human density (top 10.5% densest areas in France) and wetland concentration (top 19.3% most likely wetland areas) were significant factors in USUV case locations. Using generalised additive mixed models on REZOP data, we also highlighted the decline in common blackbird population trends in areas with medium and even more with high USUV pressure (areas defined based on SAGIR-AFVPZ data) following the 2018 outbreak (respectively -7.4% [-11.4; -3.9]95% and -15.7% [-16.2; -9.1]95%). A large area (radius [~]150 km) in the centre and centre-west of France, and smaller areas in the south-east, north and north-east of France (each with a radius [~] 50 km) were particularly affected. We conclude on the importance to work with synergistic networks to assess infection spread in wild bird species, as well as the negative impact of an emerging arbovirus.

Quantifying the proteins present in flagellar motors from a range of species delivers insight into how motility has changed throughout history and provides a platform for estimating from its genome whether a species is likely to be motile. We conducted sequence and structural homology searches for 54 flagellar pathway proteins across 11,365 bacterial genomes and developed a classifier with up to 95% accuracy that could predict whether a strain was motile or not. We then mapped the evolution of flagellar motility across the GTDB bacterial tree of life. We confirmed that the last common bacterial ancestor had flagellar motility and that the rate of loss of this motility was four-fold higher than the rate of gain. We showed that the presence of filament protein homologues was highly phylogenetically correlated with motility and that all species classified as motile contained at least one filament homologue. We calculated the rate of gain and loss for each flagellar protein and that the filament protein FliC was highly correlated with motility across the tree of life. We then measured the correlation of each flagellar motor protein with FliC and showed that the filament, rotor, and rod and hook proteins were all highly correlated with FliC, and thus with motility. We calculated the differential rates of gain and loss for each flagellar protein and quantified which genomes encoded for partial sets of flagellar proteins, indicating potential pathways by which motility could be lost. Overall, we show that filament, rod and hook and rotor proteins are conserved when flagellar motility is preserved and that the presence or absence of a FliC homologue is a good, simple predictor of whether or not a species has flagellar motility.",NA,biorxiv

We show that while mitochondrial damage and PINK1/Parkin activation events are distributed throughout axons, mitophagy initiation and autophagosome formation are restricted to presynapses, which we show contain the machineries required for mitophagy. Being the primary sites of axonal mitophagy, presynapses were vulnerable when PINK1/Parkin mitophagy was defective. We observed local cytochrome c release within presynapses from an accumulation of damaged mitochondria.

Moreover, whether cavefish sleep less than surface individuals in their natural habitats is currently unknown. Analyzing the distribution of sleep loss and its relationship with other regressive traits in a phylogenetic framework is critical to inform the selective pressures across the different lineages. We measured sleep and locomotor activity in 15 distinct populations of A. mexicanus, including lineages that are broadly representative of the 34 cavefish populations identified to date. Sleep was drastically reduced in all cave and hybrid populations that were tested. A subset of caves contain hybrid populations of A. mexicanus, which show a broad range of eye and pigmentation phenotypes, yet have evolved near-complete loss of sleep. Mapping behavioral changes onto the phylogeny of A. mexicanus populations revealed that loss of sleep and elevated locomotor activity have evolved at least three times. Analysis of sleep in the wild confirms that the sleep loss phenotype observed in lab-reared fish is also present in the natural environment.

This dynamic fixation task greatly reduces peeking at peripheral targets relative to a stationary fixation task, but does not eliminate it. Here, we introduce a crowded dynamic fixation task that further enhances fixation by adding clutter around the fixation mark to leverage crowding. We assessed fixation accuracy during peripheral threshold measurement. Relative to the RMS gaze error during the stationary fixation task, dynamic fixation error was 61%, while crowded dynamic fixation error was only 47%. With a 1.5{degrees} tolerance, peeking occurred on 9% of trials with stationary fixation, 4% with dynamic fixation, and 0% with crowded dynamic fixation. This improvement eliminated implausibly low peripheral thresholds, likely by preventing peeking.

This finding supports the proposed ""systemic bio-inequity"" hypothesis. In attempting to solve poverty through conservation, a second paradox emerges: conservation investments align neither with the economic capacity to protect nature nor with the global distribution of biodiversity.

To address this need, we require scalable approaches that are relatively inexpensive compared to traditional drug development. In the absence of a validated drug target, phenotypic screening in model organisms provides a route for identifying candidate treatments. Success requires a screenable phenotype, however the right phenotype and assay may not be obvious for pleiotropic neuromuscular disorders. Here we show that high-throughput imaging and quantitative phenotyping can be conducted systematically on a panel of C. elegans disease model strains. We used CRISPR genome-editing to create 25 worm models of human Mendelian diseases and phenotyped them using a single standardised assay. All but two strains were significantly different from wild-type controls in at least one feature. The observed phenotypes were diverse, but mutations of genes predicted to have related functions in their human orthologs led to similar behavioural differences in worms. As a proof-of-concept, we performed a drug repurposing screen of an FDA approved compound library, and identified two compounds that rescued the behavioural phenotype of a model of UNC80 deficiency. Our results show that a single assay to measure multiple phenotypes can be applied systematically to diverse Mendelian disease models. The relatively short time and low cost associated with creating and phenotyping multiple strains suggests that high-throughput worm tracking could provide a scalable approach to drug repurposing commensurate with the number of Mendelian diseases.",NA,biorxiv

Despite their importance as integrated indicators of plant responses to environmental shifts, community-level adaptations of fine root traits to global climate and soil nutrient gradients remain poorly understood. This study synthesizes data from 301 natural communities worldwide to examine the mechanisms driving fine root trait variation across different community types. Our findings demonstrate distinct regulatory pathways: precipitation negatively correlates with root tissue density, reflecting optimized resource capture in humid environments, whereas in arid regions, higher root tissue density enhances resilience by increasing structural stability and prolonging root lifespan to cope with resource scarcity. Additionally, temperature-driven phosphorus limitation reduces root phosphorus content. Soil nutrient enrichment promotes thinner roots and elevated specific root length, indicative of autonomous nutrient acquisition strategies, while nutrient scarcity favors thicker roots and reduced specific root length, signifying increased mycorrhizal dependence. The divergent patterns of root nitrogen content in relation to soil nitrogen between grasslands and forests suggest that grasslands employ an ""acquisitive"" nutrient acquisition strategy, while forests adopt a more ""conservative"" approach. Principal component analysis reveals coordinated variation in community-level root traits, challenging the universality of the species-level root economics space.

While performing the screening of an FDA-approved repurposed library of small molecule inhibitors against the auxotrophic strain Mtb mc2 6206, which lacks leuC-leuD and panC-panD genes, we identified a molecule namely semapimod, which exclusively inhibits growth of the auxotrophic strain, whereas no effect is observed against the wild-type Mtb H37Rv. Interestingly, 24 h of exposure of Mtb mc2 6206 to semapimod causes massive transcriptional reprogramming with differential expression of >450 genes associated with a myriad of metabolic activities. By performing a series of experiments, we affirm that semapimod indeed inhibits the L-leucine uptake in Mtb mc2 6206 by targeting a protein involved in the cell-wall lipid biosynthesis pathway. Remarkably, semapimod treatment of mice infected with Mtb H37Rv causes a significant reduction of bacterial load in lungs and spleen, despite showing no efficacy against the pathogenic strain in vitro.

However, how these SPN subtypes regulate spontaneous locomotion in the context of environmental valence remains unclear. Using Sepw1-Cre transgenic mice, which label a specific SPN subtype characterized by a patchy distribution of cell bodies in the dorsal striatum, we found that these patchy striatonigral neurons constrain motor vigor in response to valence differentials. In a modified light/dark box test, mice exhibited differential walking speeds between the light and dark zones. Genetic ablation of these patchy SPNs disrupted restful slowing in the dark zone and increased zone discrimination by speed. In vivo recordings linked the activity of these neurons to zone occupancy, speed, and deceleration, with a specific role in mediating deceleration. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of patchy SPNs--and optical activation of striatonigral neurons in particular--reduced locomotion and attenuated speed-based zone discrimination.

While mixing costs decreased in both training groups initially, only the SW group maintained these training-related improvements at the end of training. Activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex decreased with training, but again only the SW group maintained these activation decreases at the end of training. Condition-specific connectivity increases with task switching became less pronounced with training, especially in the SI group. Lower costs of task switching along with decreased task-related activations suggest increased processing efficiency in frontoparietal regions with training. Intensive task-switching training was associated with sustained changes, possibly facilitated by a greater mismatch between processing supplies and environmental demands.

Conversely, specific single amino-acid changes in IAPP are enough to accelerate its aggregation rate. Understanding how mutations impact IAPP aggregation can help gain mechanistic understanding into the process of pathogenic amyloid formation of this peptide and preventively identify mutations that may contribute to the risk of developing T2D. Here, we employ deep mutational scanning to measure the ability to nucleate amyloids for 1663 IAPP variants, including substitutions, insertions, truncations and deletions and identify variants that increase amyloid formation in all mutation classes. Our results point at a continuous stretch of residues (15-32) which likely is structured in IAPP amyloids and that matches the core of the early aggregated species formed by IAPP in vitro. Inside this region, mutations have a more drastic effect in the 21-27 NNFGAIL segment, suggesting tighter structural constraints for this stretch in IAPP amyloids.

Under complete linkage, we investigate the likelihood of evolutionary rescue on a mutator background that either emerges de novo or pre-exists in the population prior to a severe environmental change. If such an evolutionary rescue event occurs, the mutator lineage sweeps into the population, and thus the environmental stress has promoted mutators. Our findings indicate that mutation rate evolution can substantially boost rescue probabilities, but stronger mutators are most effective when the wildtype has a low mutation rate, while their advantage diminishes for higher wildtype mutation rates. Interestingly, at intermediate wildtype mutation rates, emerging mutators can be almost equally likely to sweep no matter how slowly or quickly the environment changes. However, at low wildtype mutation rates, mutators are only likely to sweep for very slow environmental changes due to the sequential nature of necessary mutations for such sweeps to occur. Finally, we show that pre-existing mutators can be significantly more likely to rescue the population compared to the wildtype, provided the wildtype's mutation rate is relatively low.

To help resolve longstanding debates about the behavioral significance of dopamine across timescales, we developed a novel quantification strategy, augmenting extensively used carbon-fiber Fast Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV). We iteratively engineered the FSCV scan sequence to rapidly modify electrode sensitivity within a sampling window and applied ratiometric analysis for wideband dopamine measurement. This allowed us to selectively eliminate artifacts unrelated to electrochemical detection (i.e., baseline drift), overcoming previous limitations that precluded wideband dopamine detection from milliseconds to hours. We extensively characterize this approach in vitro, validate performance in vivo with simultaneous microdialysis, and deploy this technique to measure wideband dopamine changes across striatal regions under pharmacological, optogenetic, and behavioral manipulations.

Haploinsufficiency of NSD1 results in the overgrowth disorder Sotos syndrome in vivo, which is associated with aberrant DNA methylation signatures and an enhanced epigenetic age. To understand the mechanisms by which NSD1 may regulate development, differentiation and diseases, we generated human iPSC lines deficient in functional NSD1 (NSD1-KO).

Notably, the loss of functional NSD1 altered the differentiation potential of iPSCs, with aberrant endodermal and mesodermal lineage commitment.

Two distinct thermal transitions were observed by RLS: the first melting point (Tm1) at 30{degrees}C and the second (Tm2) at 91{degrees}C, indicating changes in aggregation state. The fluorescence polarization revealed a fast rotational dynamics of the aggregates at Tm2, leading to greater depolarization of the emitted light. The structural organization of the Ozempic aggregates was studied using two dyes, Laurdan for lipid components and 1,8-ANS for protein component (GLP1). Thus, revealing a stable PEG-lipid core which hold the GLP1, increasing their exposition to the solvent. An enhanced FRET event inside the aggregates in presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ was observed. We conclude that the PEG-lipid core plays a significant role in the aggregates structure stability, being a key to improve the biological activity of Ozempic. This methodology can be used to study similar aggregation constructs in the pharmaceutical industry.",NA,biorxiv

Despite the recognized biological importance of rare variants (Lee et al., 2012), no widely adopted similarity metric prioritizes rare variant sharing in relationship inference.

We introduce two novel metrics: the Bouziane Similarity Index (BSI), a frequency-weighted score emphasizing rare variant matches, and BSI-VAR, a variant that integrates allele dosage and inverse variance weighting to capture partial allele sharing and amplify rare variant signals. To evaluate these metrics, we first performed unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) on simulated genotype similarity matrices, showing that BSI and BSI-VAR provide clearer genetic structure compared to IBS. We then conducted controlled simulations involving Parent-Child, Sibling, and Random genetic pairs to quantify discriminative performance.

Through all evaluations, BSI and especially BSI-VAR consistently outperformed IBS in distinguishing genetic relationships. These findings establish BSI and BSI-VAR as robust, interpretable, and rare-variant-aware alternatives for modern genetic similarity analysis, with potential applications in population genetics, ancestry inference, and precision medicine (Ashley, 2016; Manolio et al., 2009).",NA,biorxiv

Currently the demand is more than the supply as the current output falls below the expected. This necessitated the breeding of superior genotypes that are high yielding. These superior genotypes also requires a fertile soil for optimum production. However, this has been primarily achieved through the application of inorganic manures. It is then important to evaluate four newly released cassava varieties in an organically enriched soil relative to the local best variety. Four newly released cassava varieties, Hope, Obasanjo2, Baba 70, and Game changer, and one Local Best (LB) was planted in 5-years fallowed farm lands at three plots (A, B and C) for 2 seasons. It was a three-way factorial (5-varieties*3-farms*2-seasons) arranged in a randomized complete block design and replicated three times. Data were taken on the Fresh Tuber Weight (FTW) and Stem Height (SH) per variety, and pre and post soil status. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance, while differences in varietal means were separated using least significant differences at 5% level of significance. The FTW and SH differed significantly across varieties, years and interaction between variety, farms and year, and ranged from 19.2{+/-}0.5 (LB) to 41.0{+/-}0.5 (Obasanjo2), 32.1{+/-}0.4 (farm C) to 34.1{+/-}0.4 (farm A), 30.4{+/-}0.3 (year two) to 35.0{+/-}0.3 (year one), and the interactions between variety and year, farms and year, and variety, year and farms were significant.

Adenosine undergoes ATP-dependent phosphorylation catalyzed by adenosine kinase (ADK). In plants, ADK also phosphorylates cytokinin ribosides, transport forms of the hormone. Here, we investigated the substrate preferences, oligomeric states and structures of ADKs from moss (Physcomitrella patens) and maize (Zea mays) alongside metabolomic and phenotypic analyses. We showed that dexamethasone-inducible ZmADK overexpressor lines in Arabidopsis can benefit from a higher number of lateral roots and larger root areas under nitrogen starvation. We discovered that maize and moss enzymes can form dimers upon increasing protein concentration, setting them apart from the monomeric human and protozoal ADKs. Structural and kinetic analyses revealed a catalytically inactive unique dimer. Within the dimer, both active sites are mutually blocked. The activity of moss ADKs, exhibiting a higher propensity to dimerize, was tenfold lower compared to maize ADKs. Two monomeric structures in a ternary complex highlight the characteristic transition from an open to a closed state upon substrate binding. This suggests that the oligomeric state switch can modulate the activity of moss ADKs and likely other plant ADKs. Moreover, dimer association represents a novel negative feedback mechanism, helping to maintain steady levels of adenosine and AMP.",10.1093/jxb/eraf094,biorxiv

Electrophysiological recordings revealed that the degree of event-related synchronization in the alpha and beta bands during a basic motor imagery task was correlated with imagery-evoked motor learning.

The promise of such approaches is partly hampered by well known sampling issues of typical simulations, where time scales available are significantly shorter than the process of interest. For the system of interest here, the binding of modulators of Hepatitis B virus capsid self-assembly, the binding site is at a flexible protein-protein interface. Characterization of the conformational landscape and how it is altered upon ligand binding is thus a prerequisite for a complete mechanistic description of capsid assembly modulation. However, such a description can be difficult due to the aforementioned sampling issues of standard MD, and enhanced sampling strategies are required. Here we employ the Weighted Ensemble methodology to characterize the free-energy landscape of our earlier determined functionally relevant progress coordinates. It is shown that this approach provides conformations outside those sampled by standard MD, as well as an increased number of structures with correspondingly enlarged binding pockets conducive to ligand binding, illustrating the utility of Weighted Ensemble for computational drug development.

To clarify its function, we studied cutA knockout mutants from two phylogenetically distant species, E. coli and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, using phenotyping combined with targeted and untargeted metabolomics. Native metabolomics of cell extracts revealed the lumazine dehydroxyxanthopterin B2, a previously uncharacterized pteridine, to bind CutA in both species. Based on these results, we identified other pteridines, including the essential cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, as ligands of CutA proteins. In the presence of pterins, we observed higher affinity of CutA to copper ions. These findings, alongside the known role of pteridines as redox shuttles, suggest a previously unrecognized role for CutA in coordinating copper homeostasis and redox balance via pteridine metabolism.

SignificanceWe identified the molecular class of pteridines as natural ligands of CutA, including the so far unknown lumazine dehydroxyxanthopterin B2. Pteridines are known redox shuttles involved in various cellular processes such as cofactors for redox enzymes. Our data showed increased copper binding to CutA in the presence of pteridines. Together, these results suggest that pteridines are physiological ligands of CutA that may modulate copper binding and redox homeostasis.",NA,biorxiv

The sister genera Cryptococcus and Kwoniella provide a powerful framework for studying MAT loci evolution owing to their diverse reproductive strategies and distinct architectures, spanning bipolar and tetrapolar systems with either linked or unlinked MAT loci. Building on recent large-scale comparative genomic analyses, we generated additional chromosome-level assemblies uncovering distinct evolutionary trajectories shaping MAT loci organization. Contrasting with the small-scale expansions and gene acquisitions observed in Kwoniella, our analyses revealed independent expansions of the P/R locus in tetrapolar Cryptococcus, possibly driven by pheromone gene duplications. Notably, these expansions coincided with an enrichment of AT-rich codons and a pronounced GC-content reduction, likely associated with recombination suppression and relaxed codon usage selection. Diverse modes of MAT locus linkage were also identified, including three previously unrecognized transitions: one resulting in a pseudobipolar arrangement and two leading to bipolarity. All the three transitions involved translocations. In the pseudobipolar configuration, the P/R and HD loci remained on the same chromosome but genetically unlinked, whereas the bipolar transitions additionally featured rearrangements that fused the two loci into a nonrecombining region. Mating assays confirmed a sexual cycle in C. decagattii, demonstrating its ability to undergo mating and sporulation. Progeny analysis in K. mangrovensis revealed substantial ploidy variation and aneuploidy, likely stemming from haploid-diploid mating, yet evidence of recombination and loss of heterozygosity indicates that meiotic exchange occurs despite irregular chromosome segregation. Our findings underscore the importance of continued diversity sampling and provides further evidence for convergent evolution of fused MAT loci in basidiomycetes, offering new insights into the genetic and chromosomal changes driving reproductive transitions.",NA,biorxiv

Previous work suggested differential roles of the medial hypothalamus (MH) and lateral hypothalamus (LH) in aggressive behaviors, but little is known about how their resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) may relate to aggression in humans.

MethodsWe employed the data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and examined the rsFCs of LH and MH in 745 young adults (393 women). We also explored sex differences in the rsFCs. We processed the imaging data with published routines and evaluated the results of voxel-wise regression on aggression score, as obtained from Achenbach Adult Self Report, with a corrected threshold.

ResultsThe analysis revealed significant rsFC between the LH and clusters in the middle temporal and occipital gyri across all subjects and in the thalamus for men, both in negative correlation with aggression score. Slope test confirmed sex differences in the correlation between LH-thalamus rsFC and aggression score. No significant rsFC was observed for MH.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest a role of LH rsFCs and sex differences in LH-thalamus rsFC in the manifestation of aggression in humans. The findings highlight the need for further research into sex-specific neural pathways in aggression and other related behavioral traits of importance to mental health.",NA,biorxiv

Most TWAS approaches fundamentally assume that the training dataset (used to fit the gene expression prediction model) and testing GWAS dataset are from the same ancestrally homogenous population. If this assumption is violated, studies have shown a marked negative impact on expression prediction accuracy as well as reduced power of the downstream genetrait association test. These issues pose a particular problem for admixed individuals, whose genomes represent a mosaic of multiple continental ancestral segments. To resolve these issues, we present CADET, which enables powerful TWAS of admixed cohorts leveraging the local-ancestry (LA) information of the cohort along with summary-level eQTL data from reference panels of different ancestral groups. CADET combines multiple polygenic risk score models based on the summary-level eQTL reference data to predict LA-aware GReX components in admixed test samples. Using simulated data, we compare the imputation accuracy, power, and type I error rate of our proposed LA-aware approach to LA-unaware methods for performing TWASs. We show that CADET performs optimally in nearly all settings regardless of whether the genetic architecture of gene expression is dependent or independent of ancestry.

However, emerging evidence suggests that pseudogenes, once viewed as genomic relics, may contribute to the origin of functional lncRNA genes. In this study spanning eight species, we systematically identified pseudogene-associated lncRNA genes using our PacBio long-read sequencing data and published RNA-seq data. Our investigation revealed that pseudogene-associated lncRNA genes exhibit heightened functional attributes compared to their non-pseudogene-associated counterparts. Notably, these pseudogene-associated lncRNAs show protein-binding proficiency, positioning them as potent regulators of gene expression. In particular, pseudogene-associated sense lncRNAs retain protein-binding capabilities inherited from parent genes of pseudogenes, thereby demonstrating greater protein-binding proficiency. Through detailed functional characterization, we elucidated the unique advantages and conserved roles of pseudogene-associated lncRNA genes, particularly in the context of gene expression regulation and DNA repair. Leveraging cross-species expression profiling, we demonstrated the prominent contribution of pseudogene-associated lncRNA genes to aging-related transcriptome changes across nine human tissues and eight mouse tissues. Overall, our findings demonstrate enhanced functional attributes of pseudogene-associated lncRNA genes and shed light on their conserved and close association with aging.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we reconstruct marine biodiversity in Iceland across three millennia (1315 BCE-1785 CE), encompassing periods of climatic fluctuation and human settlement, to explore the comparative effect of natural and anthropogenic forces on marine biodiversity. We performed 18S metabarcoding of ancient environmental DNA from two sediment cores collected from northern Icelandic shelf seas, integrating local climatic records, population estimates and zooarchaeological remains from published sources to estimate the influence of climatic and anthropogenic impacts. Against the backdrop of increasing human populations and marine exploitation, we observe no large-scale taxonomic shifts or anthropogenic biodiversity changes across the period. In contrast, we found a positive correlation between herring (Clupea harengus) detection rates and proxy-reconstructed sea surface temperature, suggesting a role for climate in shaping marine biodiversity.

The SWI has proved difficult to explain via traditional Bayesian models, which predict the opposite effect: expected weight from size (smaller = lighter) should be integrated with felt weight, such that the smaller object should be perceptually lighter. Other authors have proposed that weight and density are combined according to Bayesian principles, or that Bayesian models incorporating efficient coding can predict the SWI via  likelihood repulsion. These models, however, have been evaluated only under the narrow conditions of typical SWI stimuli. Here we establish a general model of perceived weight for pairs of objects that differ in weight and / or density and / or size by varying amounts. In a visuo-haptic task, participants (N = 30) grasped and lifted pairs of cubes, and reported their perceived heaviness. We report that the SWI occurs even at very small density differences, repudiating the idea that the illusion requires a significant conflict between expected and felt weight. Across all object pairs, perceived weight was well explained by a model (R2 = .98) that includes a positive influence of both objects weights and the judged objects density, but a negative influence of the other objects density. Critically, the influence of both densities on perceived weight is strongly modulated by weight difference, being three times as large for zero / small weight differences than large differences. Thus, it is only under the unusual conditions of typical SWI studies that we confuse weight with density to a substantial extent. Unlike existing models, that are inconsistent with our more comprehensive dataset, our model provides a quantitative, accurate and generalised account of weight perception for pairs of objects across various weight and size conditions.

Author summaryKnowing how heavy an object is allows us to grasp and lift it efficiently and without mishaps. Surprisingly, humans make systematic errors when judging the weight of objects of different size. For example, when two objects differ in size but have identical weight, the smaller object feels heavier. This is the  size-weight illusion. The illusion is strong and reliable and occurs even when we know that the two objects actually have the same weight. The size-weight illusion demonstrates that the human perceptual system doesnt work like a weighing scale, but instead takes into account other object features such as size or density, alongside weight. In this paper, we present a model that allows us to predict perceived weight in the size-weight illusion and across a wide range of objects of different weight / size / density, where previous models have failed.",NA,biorxiv

In Latin America, culls of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) for rabies control have been indicated to raise viral spatial spread by increasing long-range movement and inter-colony mixing among surviving bats, but behavioural responses to disturbance have not been quantified.
C_LIO_LIWe used Global Positioning System (GPS) tags to track the movements of 93 vampire bats from 5 roosts in the Peruvian Andes over 9 nights after human disturbance (capture, handling and tag attachment). Responses to disturbance were modelled under a Bayesian state-space framework that estimated bat departure time, activity duration, and travel distances while accounting for the sparse GPS data obtainable in a topographically complex landscape where vampire bats occur.
C_LIO_LIA large fraction of bats (43%, 39/90) abandoned the study area on the night of disturbance, with more abandonment observed in groups expected to have greater dispersal capacity (males and bats with longer forearms). Among the remaining bats, we observed high individual heterogeneity on the night of disturbance, with some bats staying atypically close to the roost and others travelling unusually long distances. With increasing time post-disturbance, bats tended to remain closer to the roost.
C_LIO_LIAnalysis of inferred flight histories showed that bats travelled >5 km on most nights, with high variability both within individuals across nights and between individuals in the same roost.
C_LIO_LIBy inferring movement from irregular and error-prone data, our model extends the utility of animal-borne GPS tracking to landscapes with poor satellite visibility, revealing greater complexity in vampire bat movement than previously recognised. Vampire bat disturbance was associated with three distinct behavioural responses: roost abandonment, increased flight distances and extreme individual heterogeneity on the night of disturbance. In the context of vampire bat management, such perturbations would be expected to exacerbate the spatial spread of rabies and potentially undermine the efficacy of culling activities which are currently practiced by most Latin American governments.

If the microbial partner does not reciprocate with a comparable symbiotic benefit, the interaction represents a parasitic relationship. This is thought to elicit a plants response to prevent the selective disadvantage of being parasitized by such microbial cheaters. Indeed, negative feedback against bad mutualists, known as sanctioning, has been observed in interactions such as the arbuscular mycorrhizal and legume-rhizobium symbioses. Here, to study sanctioning by the plant host, we manipulate the exchange of resources between the model legume Medicago truncatula and its bacterial partner Sinorhizobium meliloti by three ways: mutating the bacterial nitrogenase enzyme, replacing nitrogen in the atmosphere with argon gas, and supplying high nitrate to the host. Then, we follow the consequences for the interaction by examining the metabolome, proteome, and phosphoproteome of nodules. We find that such cheating conditions result in sanctioning of the bacterial partner, and observe characteristic shifts including induced defense markers, repressed symbiotic markers, and changes in central metabolism that may be relevant for microbial fitness and that could therefore contribute to sanctioning.",NA,biorxiv

Autocorrelated kernel density estimation addresses many of the shortcomings of traditional home range estimators when animal tracking data is autocorrelated, but other challenges in home range estimation remain.
C_LIO_LIOne such issue is known as  spillover bias, in which home range estimates do not respect impassable movement boundaries (e.g., shorelines, fences), and occurs in all forms of kernel density estimation. While several approaches to addressing spillover bias are used when estimating home ranges, these approaches introduce bias throughout the remaining home range area, depending on the amount of spillover removed, or are otherwise inaccessible to most ecologists. Here, we introduce local corrections to home range kernels to mitigate spillover bias in (autocorrelated) kernel density estimation in the continuous time movement model (ctmm) package, and demonstrate their performance using simulations with known home range extents and distributions, and a real world case study.
C_LIO_LISimulation results showed that local corrections minimised bias in bounded home range area estimates, and resulted in more accurate distributions when compared to commonly used post-hoc corrections, particularly at small-intermediate sample sizes.
C_LIO_LIComparison of the impacts of local vs post-hoc corrections to bounded home ranges estimated from lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) demonstrated that local corrections constrained bias within the remaining home range area, resulting in proportionally smaller home range areas compared to when post-hoc corrections are used.

We assembled and annotated a chromosome-scale reference genome of the riverine sailfin silverside Telmatherina bonti and generated whole genome sequences of all species of Telmatherina in Lake Matano, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, one of the worlds oldest and deepest lakes. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships within the adaptive radiation of sailfin silversides and inferred past and ongoing introgression patterns. Genome-wide tests confirmed two monophyletic clades, sharpfins and roundfins. However, within clades, we found mismatches between morphology-based taxonomic assignments and genome-wide genetic relationships. We found signs of both old and ongoing introgression between river-dwelling T. bonti and the lacustrine sharpfin group, as shown in elevated D-statistic, f4-ratio and f-branch statistic. Levels of excess allele sharing between riverine species and the three most common lacustrine species declined with increasing distance from the river-inlet, indicating ongoing introgression at the lake-river interface.

The task was a ball rotation, where participants circulated two balls on their palm by using their fingers. Seventy-six healthy young adults were randomly assigned to one of three mental practice groups or a control group without mental practice. In the mental practice groups, three subgroups of participants engaged in ball-rotation motor imagery for two blocks in different orders: bilateral hand imagery followed by left hand imagery (BL group), left hand imagery followed by bilateral hand imagery (LB group), and consecutive left hand imagery (LL group). The results showed greater improvement in actual motor performance in the BL group than in the control group, while the performance of the LB and LL groups did not significantly differ from that of the control group. Greater ERD was observed in the BL group than in the LL group in the early sets of the first block. However, ERD amplitude decreased with continued mental practice, and significant correlations between ERD and motor performance were limited. These results suggest that engaging in bilateral mental practice before unilateral mental practice is beneficial in improving unilateral motor performance. Bilateral mental practice following unilateral mental practice may provide neither notable improvements nor detrimental effects on unilateral motor action.

We characterized ABAP1 Interacting Protein (named AIP10) investigating its role in modulating plant development. T-DNA insertion lines with silenced expression of AIP10 were evaluated phenotypically (morphology, fresh and dry weight), via transcriptomics analyses (RNA-seq and RT-qPCR), physiologically (biochemically, Fluorcam and Li- COR), and metabolically (ATR-FTIR). We showed that AIP10 integrates cell division rates with transcriptional and primary metabolism reprogramming, through its protein interactions with ABAP1 and KIN10, a subunit of SnRK1 (Sucrose non-fermenting-1- related protein kinase 1). ABAP1 levels and activity were reduced in the absence of AIP10, licensing cell cycle progression for longer periods, which culminated in increased rates of cell division that boosted vegetative and reproductive growth. AIP10 silencing triggered a major transcriptional reprogramming of plant primary metabolism, possibly through SnRK1 regulation. aip10 mutants showed increased photosynthetic efficiency, as well as boosted carbon fixation, leading to increased biomass, seed productivity, and higher contents of proteins, lipids (triglycerides), and carbohydrates. Finally, we propose that the modulation of AIP10 expression is part of a mechanism that coordinates higher rates of cell division with better photosynthetic performance and carbon fixation to metabolically meet the plant energy demand, allowing the generation of plants with increased biomass and productivity.

Although effcient methods have been used, such as the identification of protein domains stored in Pfam, most of the proteins of this virus have no detectable homologous protein domains outside the viral taxa. As it is now well established that some viral proteins share similarities with proteins of their hosts, we decided to explore the hypothesis that this lack of homologies could be, at least in part, the result of the documented loss of sensitivity of Pfam Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) when searching for domains in ""divergent organisms"". In order to improve the annotation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we used the HHpred protein annotation tool. To avoid ""false positive predictions"" as much as possible, we designed a robustness procedure to evaluate the HHpred results. In total, 6 robust similarities involving 6 distinct SARS-CoV-2 proteins were detected. Of these 6 similarities, 3 are already known and well documented, and one is in agreement with recent crystallographic results. We then examined carefully the two similarities that have not yet been reported in the literature. We first show that the C-terminal part of Spike S (the protein that binds the virion to the cell membrane by interacting with the host receptor, triggering infection) has similarities with the human prominin-1/CD133; after reviewing what is known about prominin-1/CD133, we suggest that the C-terminal part of Spike S could both improve the docking of Spike S to ACE2 (the main cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2) and be involved in the delivery of virions to regions where ACE2 is located in cells. Secondly, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein shares similarities with human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as Lutropin-choriogonadotropic hormone receptor, primarily belonging to the ""Rhodopsin family"". To further investigate these similarities, we compared Prominin 1 and Lutropin-choriogonadotropic hormone receptor to a set of viral proteins using HHPRED.

Equally interestingly, Lutropin-choriogonadotropic hormone receptor showed similarities with 23 viral G-protein coupled receptors, particularly from Herpesvirales.

Conventional exploration-exploitation solutions collapse punishment and reward into a single feedback signal, whereby early losses can be overcome by later gains. However, the brain has a separate system for Pavlovian fear learning, suggesting a possible computational advantage to maintaining a specific fear memory during exploratory decision-making. In a series of simulations, we show this promotes safe but efficient learning and is optimised by arbitrating Pavlovian avoidance of instrumental decision-making according to uncertainty. We provide a basic test of this model in a simple human approach-withdrawal experiment in virtual reality, and show that this flexible avoidance model captures choice and reaction times. These results show that the Pavlovian fear system has a more sophisticated role in decision-making than previously thought, by shaping flexible exploratory behaviour in a computationally precise manner.",NA,biorxiv

Through tailored methylation-prone pre-training, MethylQUEEN effectively captured epigenetics information hidden within the DNA sequences: it accurately traces DNAs tissue-of-origin, and successfully recovers the expression profile through methylation states. Integrative analysis on MethylQUEENs attention scores also enables us to reveal the unique methylation status of a tissue for precise disease detection, and identifying key regulatory 5mC sites for disease intervention. As a result, MethylQUEEN signifies a new paradigm in methylation analysis for various biological problems.

Traditional classification relies on clinical attributes, but the growing understanding of asthmas heterogeneity highlights the need for phenotyping. Effective management requires regular monitoring, medication, and prevention of exacerbations, but current diagnostic methods face challenges such as the lack of definitive tests and reliance on subjective measures. Implementing precision medicine, especially for severe cases, necessitates identifying measurable markers in biofluids. This study explores machine learning methods to identify biomarkers differentiating various asthma phenotypic states. We measured inflammatory markers in both plasma and saliva samples and used machine learning algorithms to determine their efficacy in reflecting airway inflammation. Our findings indicate that saliva markers provide a more accurate representation of localized inflammation compared to plasma markers, which reflect a systemic response. Using MRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) ranking, we enhanced model efficacy. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier achieved 75% accuracy with the first 12 saliva markers, while the Random Forest (RF) classifier performed best for plasma models, though with lower accuracy. Our results suggest machine learning can effectively identify key markers for asthma phenotyping, aiding personalized treatment strategies.

These morphologies, characterised by a high topological genus, can be visualised as spherical double membranes connected by neck-like structures. The necks are often occupied by specific biomolecular complexes, such as the nuclear pore complex, which divide the space into three distinct compartments. Understanding how the size of these necks responds to pressure gradients is fundamentally important for unravelling the influence of mechanical stimuli on traffic control through the necks, for example, in nuclear mechanosensing. In this work, we use computer simulations and theoretical analysis to investigate how neck size responds to variations in pressure or tension. Our findings reveal a two-phase behaviour: below a certain threshold, necks constrict as the pressure gradient increases, while above that threshold, they dilate. This response stems from the pure membranes mechanics and depends on the magnitude of the pressure gradient, the initial diameter of the neck and the membrane bending rigidity. We also provide a simple equation that links the threshold tension, the neck diameter and the bending rigidity, offering a useful tool to quickly assess different scenarios. Our results furthermore show that protein complexes in the neck partially counteract both constriction and dilation, stabilising neck size while preserving the same two-phase response to membrane tension.

Such knowledge is key to understanding how viruses take up residence and transmit infectious virus, in some cases throughout the life of the host. Here, using murine polyomavirus (muPyV) as a tractable model, we monitor parallel infections of thousands of differentially barcoded viruses within a single host. In individual mice, we show that numerous viruses (>2600) establish infection and are maintained for long periods post-infection. Strikingly, a low level of many different barcodes is shed in urine at all times post-infection, with a minimum of at least 80 different barcodes present in every sample throughout months of infection. During the early acute phase, bulk shed virus genomes derive from numerous different barcodes. This is followed by long term persistent infection detectable in diverse organs. Consistent with limited productive exchange of virus genomes between organs, each displays a unique pattern of relative barcode abundance. During the persistent phase, constant low-level shedding of typically hundreds of barcodes is maintained but is overlapped with rare, punctuated shedding of high amounts of one or a few individual barcodes. In contrast to the early acute phase, these few infrequent highly shed barcodes comprise the majority of bulk shed genomes observed during late times of persistent infection, contributing to a stark decrease in bulk barcode diversity that is shed over time. These temporally shifting patterns, which are conserved across hosts, suggest that polyomaviruses balance continuous transmission potential with reservoir-driven high-level reactivation. This offers a mechanistic basis for polyomavirus ubiquity and long-term persistence, which are typical of many DNA viruses.

Author Summary / ImportancePolyomavirus infections, mostly benign but potentially fatal for immunocompromised individuals, undergo acute and long-term persistent infections. Typically, polyomavirus-associated diseases arise due to virus infection occurring in the context of a persistently infected individual. However, little is understood regarding the mechanisms of how polyomaviruses establish, maintain, and reactivate from persistent infection. We developed a non-invasive virus shedding assay combining barcoded murine polyomavirus, massively parallel sequencing technology, and novel computational approaches to track long-term infections in mice. We expect these methods to be of use not only to the study of DNA viruses but also for understanding persitent infection of diverse microbes. The study revealed organ-specific virus reservoirs and two distinct shedding patterns: constant low-level shedding of numerous barcodes and episodic high-level shedding of few barcodes. Over time, the diversity of shed barcodes decreased substantially. These findings suggest a persistent low-level infection in multiple reservoirs, with occasional bursts of replication in a small subset of infected cells. This combination of broad reservoirs and varied shedding mechanisms may contribute to polyomavirus success in transmission and maintaining long-term infections.",10.1371/journal.ppat.1013083,biorxiv

Ezrin, a major membrane-actin linker that assembles and coordinates macromolecular signaling complexes at membranes, has emerged recently as an important regulator of lysosomal function. Here, we report that endosomal-localized EGFR/Ezrin complex interacts with and triggers the inhibition of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC complex) in response to EGF stimuli. This is regulated through activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Loss of Ezrin was not sufficient to repress TSC complex by EGF and culminated in translocation of TSC complex to lysosomes triggering suppression of mTORC1 signaling. Overexpression of constitutively active EZRINT567D is sufficient to relocalize TSC complex to the endosomes and reactivate mTORC1. Our findings identify EZRIN as a critical regulator of autophagy via TSC complex in response to EGF stimuli and establish the central role of early endosomal signaling in the regulation of mTORC1. Consistently, Medaka fish deficient for Ezrin exhibit defective endo-lysosomal pathway, attributable to the compromised EGFR/AKT signaling, ultimately leading to retinal degeneration.

Current therapeutic approaches primarily focus on symptom relief, but fail to address the underlying mechanisms of cartilage degeneration. In recent years, epigenetic reprogramming has emerged as a promising strategy for cellular rejuvenation, offering new perspectives for regenerative medicine.

This study investigates the potential of a selected set of small chemical molecules (SCM) to induce epigenetic reprogramming of chondrocytes and promote cartilage regeneration in an in vivo model of chemically induced OA. The experiments were conducted on aging female rats, a translational model chosen for its relevance to human age-related OA and postmenopausal cartilage deterioration. OA was induced via intra-articular administration of trypsin, and a subset of animals was further subjected to estrogen receptor blockade using clomiphene citrate to simulate postmenopausal conditions. The SCM cocktail was administered intra-articularly to evaluate its effects on cartilage repair. Chondroitin sulfate was used as a comparative treatment control.

The results demonstrated that SCM administration led to significant improvements in joint tissue integrity, including increased cartilage thickness, enhanced synthesis of mucopolysaccharides, and restoration of chondrocyte metabolic activity. Histological analysis revealed that SCM-treated groups exhibited reduced cartilage erosion, lower inflammatory marker expression, and improved nuclear-cytoplasmic index (NCI) values, suggesting enhanced chondrocyte function. Notably, the group with estrogen receptor blockade responded more favorably to SCM treatment than the non-blocked OA group, highlighting the potential interaction between hormonal status and epigenetic reprogramming.

These findings provide strong evidence for the feasibility of epigenetic modulation as a therapeutic strategy for OA. The ability of SCMs to restore cartilage structure and function suggests a novel approach to treating age-related degenerative diseases. Further research is required to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this rejuvenation process and optimize therapeutic protocols for clinical applications.",NA,biorxiv

Furthermore, its KDAC activity is located in an unidentified domain (from 195-245 aa). Interestingly, AhCobQ has no homology with current known KDACs, and no homologous protein was found in eukaryotic cells.

To explore the evolutionary relationship between these recombinases, here, we present high-resolution CryoEM structures of S. cerevisiae Rad51 filaments and S. cerevisiae Dmc1 filaments bound to ssDNA, which reveal a pair of stacked interfacial aromatic amino acid residues that are nearly universally conserved in Rad51 but are absent from Dmc1. We use a combination of bioinformatics, genetic analysis of natural sequence variation, and deep mutational analysis to probe the functionally tolerated sequence space for these stacked aromatic residues. Our findings demonstrate that the functional landscape of the interfacial aromatic residues within the Rad51 filament is highly constrained. In contrast, the amino acids at the equivalent positions within the Dmc1 filament exhibit a broad functional landscape. This work helps highlight the distinct evolutionary trajectories of these two eukaryotic recombinases, which may have contributed to their functional and mechanistic divergence.

AUTHOR SUMMARYMost eukaryotic organisms have two closely related proteins, Rad51 and Dmc1, that are needed for different aspects of genetic recombination. These proteins may have evolved from a single gene that was duplicated during the early evolution of eukaryotes. Rad51 is active during both normal cell division (mitosis) and sexual reproduction (meiosis), while Dmc1 is only active during meiosis. To better understand how these proteins are related, we studied their three-dimensional structures using high resolution cryogenic electron microscopy. Our findings show that Rad51 has a specific set of conserved amino acids located at the protein interfaces, but this set of amino acids is different in Dmc1. We used a series of genetic approaches to analyze how these amino acids affect the proteins function. Our results show that Rad51 has a strict set of rules governing the identify of these amino acids, whereas Dmc1 does not. This research sheds light on how Rad51 and Dmc1 have evolved differently, leading to distinct functions in genetic recombination.",NA,biorxiv

AnvRV was found to be maternally transmitted with very high fidelity but not paternally. Additionally, AnvRV was horizontally transferred at an efficiency of 23% from infected to uninfected wasp larvae that develop together inside the same mealybug host (superparasitism). To test the effects of AnvRV on A. vladimiri, the virus horizontal transmission was utilized to establish AnvRV-infected (RV+) and uninfected (RV-) isogenic wasp lines, a method rarely applied and novel to RNA virus-parasitoid systems. Longevity, developmental time, sex ratio, and fecundity of RV+ and RV- A. vladimiri were very similar. Nonetheless, the egg hatching rate of RV+ wasps was markedly and significantly higher than that of RV- wasps, especially in hosts that were not superparasitized. Additionally, less encapsulation marks (the main form of mealybug immunity) were found around RV+ eggs inside parasitized mealybug hosts.

Here we leveraged an optimized ex vivo AM model system, fetal-liver derived alveolar-like macrophages (FLAMs), to dissect the role of TGF{beta} in AMs. Using transcriptional analysis, we first globally defined how TGF{beta} regulates gene expression of resting FLAMs. We found that TGF{beta} maintains the baseline metabolic state of AMs by driving lipid metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation and restricting inflammation. To better understand inflammatory regulation in FLAMs, we next directly tested how TGF{beta} alters the response to TLR2 agonists. While both TGF{beta} (+) and TGF{beta} (-) FLAMs robustly responded to TLR2 agonists, we found an unexpected activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses in FLAMs and primary AMs in a TGF{beta}-dependent manner. Surprisingly, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein and the interferon regulator factors 3 and 7 were required for IFN production by TLR2 agonists and the IFN response was dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.

Integration with genome databases such as GO and KEGG is straightforward, as WSP model estimates of effects take the form of log fold change values.

Their DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) contains a B3 domain that allows base-specific interactions with Auxin Response Elements (AuxREs) in DNA target sites. Land plants encode three phylogenetically distinct ARF classes: the closely related A- and B-classes have overlapping DNA binding properties, contrasting with the different DNA-binding properties of the divergent C-class ARFs. ARF DNA-binding divergence likely occurred early in the evolution of the gene family, but the molecular determinants underlying it remain unclear. Here, we show that the B3 DNA-binding residues are deeply conserved in ARFs, and variability within these is only present in tracheophytes, correlating with greatly expanded ARF families. Using the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, we confirm the essential role of conserved DNA-contacting residues for ARF function. We further show that ARF B3-AuxRE interfaces are not mutation-tolerant, suggesting low evolvability that has led to the ultra-conservation of the B3-DNA interface between ARF classes. Our data support the almost complete interchangeability between A/B-class ARF B3 by performing interspecies domain swaps, even between lineages that diverged over half a billion years ago. Our analysis further suggests that DNA-binding specificity diverged early during ARF evolution in a common streptophyte ancestor, followed by strong selection as part of a competition-based auxin response system

Significance StatementAuxin response evolved nearly half a billion years ago in the earliest land plants. Auxin response is mediated by a family of DNA-binding ARF transcription factors. It has been unclear if and how the ARF family has evolved. In this paper, the authors show that the central protein-DNA interface that defines the genes that are under auxin control has remained essentially unchanged throughout auxin response evolution, explaining how auxin has become a dominant signal controlling growth and development in all land plants.",NA,biorxiv

How these inherently dynamic signals encode emotion remains only partially understood. Moreover, despite the ubiquity of speech in face-to-face interactions, the dynamics of facial emotion signals during speech have been overlooked. In Study 1 we recorded participants facial movements signalling happy, sad and angry emotions in Expression-only and Emotive-speech conditions. We then employed a data-driven pipeline integrating facial motion quantification, spatiotemporal classification and clustering to investigate the structure and function of facial dynamics in signalling emotion. Results reveal that a few fundamental spatiotemporal patterns reliably differentiated emotion in non-verbal expressions and emotive speech facial signals. Furthermore, we identified transient substates - or dynamic phases-that are diagnostic of emotion and conditions. A perceptual validation with naive observers (Study 2) showed that the low-dimensional spatiotemporal structure captures meaningful cues that closely predicts human emotion categorisations. We argue that this low-dimensional spatiotemporal structure optimises both the transmission and perception of dynamic facial emotion signals. This work contributes insights into face-to-face emotion signalling and provide a versatile framework for modelling dynamic social cues and can inform the design of expressive emotive capabilities in social agents.",NA,biorxiv

Building on recent formalizations of this phenomenon, we tackle the computational challenge of exhaustively detecting autocatalytic cycles in reactions networks, and further evaluate the impact of thermodynamic constraints on their realization under mass action kinetics. We first characterize the complexity of the detection problem by proving its NP-completeness. This justifies the use of constraint solvers to list all autocatalytic cycles in a given reaction network, and also to group them into compatible sets, composed of cycles whose stoichiometric requirements are not contradictory. Crucially, we show that the introduction of thermodynamic realism does constrain the composition of these sets. Compatibility relationships among cycles can indeed be disrupted when the reaction kinetics obey thermodynamic consistency throughout the network. On the contrary, these constraints have no impact on the realizability of isolated cycles, unless upper or lower bounds are imposed on the concentrations of the reactants. Overall, by better characterizing the conditions of autocatalysis in complex reaction systems, this work brings us a step closer to assessing the contribution of this collective chemical behavior to the emergence of natural selection in the primordial soup.

Significance StatementDescribing the processes behind the origin of life requires us to better understand self-amplifying dynamics in complex chemical systems. Detecting autocatalytic cycles is a critical but difficult step in this endeavor. After characterizing the computational complexity of this problem, we investigate the impact of thermodynamic realism on autocatalysis. We demonstrate that individual cycles, regardless of thermodynamic parameters, can be activated as long as entities may occur at any required concentration. In contrast, two cycles can become mutually incompatible due to thermodynamic constraints, and will thus never run simultaneously. These results clarify the implications of physical realism on the realization of autocatalysis.",NA,biorxiv

We leveraged our genomics datasets comprising high-resolution promoter Capture C, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq from brain-relevant cell types to fine-map AD GWAS variants, identifying 89 candidate causal SNPs and 69 effector genes. We then designed a single-cell CRISPRi screen to perturb candidate regulatory regions (n=74) and assess the transcriptional response in the human microglial cell line, HMC3. Our screen across [~]97,000 cells identified 19 regulatory regions and 19 effector genes. We then elected to functionally dissect our top hit, the TSPAN14 locus, and we show that an intronic region containing AD-associated SNPs rs7080009, rs1870138, and rs1870137 is a microglia-specific enhancer, with the AD risk haplotype increasing its activity. CRISPR precise genomic deletion of this region decreases TSPAN14 expression, alters specific cellular pathways including cell adhesion, and decreases secreted levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, which are known biomarkers of aging and AD.

However, any suppressive intervention will inevitably exert an evolutionary pressure for resistance. Here, we present a pipeline for the accelerated discovery, engineering, and testing of both natural and drive-induced variants that could reverse gene drive spread. We applied our method to stress-test a highly effective gene drive that has evaded resistance in all laboratory-contained releases to date, known as Ag(QFS)1. We showed that previously undetected resistant alleles can arise at low frequency, and discovered novel, partially resistant alleles that can perturb drive-invasion dynamics. We then engineered next-generation gene drives that can actively remove resistant alleles by targeting several highly conserved and non-overlapping sites in the female-specific exon of the doublesex gene.

The development of hypoimmunogenic, universal cells that could be transplanted to any recipient without requiring a matching donor, could significantly enhance their therapeutic potential and accelerate clinical translation. To create off-the-shelf hypoimmunogenic cells, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to delete B2M (HLA class I) and CIITA (master regulator of HLA class II). Double-knockout (DKO) iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) evaded T cell-mediated immune rejection in vitro and after grafting into the injured spinal cord of athymic rats and humanized mice. However, loss of HLA class I heightened susceptibility to host natural killer (NK) cell attack, limiting graft survival. To counter this negative effect, we engineered DKO NPCs to overexpress macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), an NK cell checkpoint ligand. MIF expression markedly reduced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and improved long-term engraftment and integration of NPCs in the animal models for spinal cord injury. These findings demonstrate that MIF overexpression, combined with concurrent B2M and CIITA deletion, generates hiPSC neural derivatives that escape both T- and NK-cell surveillance. This strategy provides a scalable route to universal donor cells for regenerative therapies in SCI and potentially other disorders.",NA,biorxiv

To effectively control such cravings, we need to better understand the factors that reduce food cue reactivity and reveal corresponding  anti-craving brain mechanisms. We previously reported that access to environmental enrichment (EE) that provides cognitive and physical stimulation in mice reduced cue-evoked sucrose seeking and prelimbic cortex (PL) neuronal reactivity.

To date, the phenotype of PL neurons that undergo EE-induced adaptations has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we used brain slice electrophysiology to investigate how EE modulated intrinsic excitability in the general population of PL interneurons and pyramidal cells. Additionally, we used retrograde tracing and the neuronal activity marker  Fos to investigate how EE modulated cue-evoked recruitment of pyramidal cells projecting to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) and nucleus accumbens core (NAc).

Before the cue-evoked sucrose seeking test, EE enhanced the general, baseline excitability of inhibitory interneurons, but not pyramidal cells, thereby promoting inhibitory  overdrive. During cue-evoked sucrose seeking, EE suppressed recruitment of PVT-, but not NAc-projecting, neurons thereby selectively promoting corticothalamic, but not corticoaccumbens, excitatory  underdrive. Collectively, we further illuminate EEs  anti-food seeking actions whereby EE promotes both cell type-specific (inhibitory interneuron  overdrive) and circuit-specific (excitatory corticothalamic  underdrive) neuroadaptations in the PL.",NA,biorxiv

While LMNA dysregulation has been implicated in genomic instability across cancer and aging, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood [2]. Here, we investigate LMNAs role in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by extreme genomic instability [3, 4]. We demonstrate that LMNA depletion promotes R-loop accumulation, transcription-replication conflicts, replication stress, DNA breaks, and micronuclei formation. Mechanistically, LMNA loss disrupts nuclear pore complex distribution, reducing phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-nucleoporin incorporation and impairing RNA export efficiency. Furthermore, we show that LMNA expression is epigenetically repressed by EZH2 during SCLC differentiation from neuroendocrine (NE) to non-NE states. Clinically, low LMNA levels correlate with significantly worse survival in SCLC patients. These findings uncover a novel role for LMNA in safeguarding genome integrity and shaping tumor heterogeneity, with broad implications for cancer and aging.

Significance StatementLamin A/C, a key structural component of the nuclear envelope, is frequently lost or mutated in cancer, laminopathies, and aging-related disorders. Lamin A/C loss is associated with genomic instability, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We demonstrate that LMNA loss drives genomic instability by promoting R-loop accumulation through disrupted nuclear pore dynamics and impaired RNA export. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized link between LMNA loss, nuclear envelope dysfunction, and genome instability.

We show that both morphs recently diverged in their plumage coloration: while the brown morph is on a steady trajectory toward more intense plumage pigmentation, the gray morph has recently shifted toward lighter plumage, following a series of extreme winters. Evidence suggests that this divergence is driven by the brown morphs higher reproductive success and greater plasticity in response to seasonality, while the gray morph, with its more genetically determined plumage color and limited standing variation, has a reduced capacity to respond to selection and track new phenotypic optima. Our study confirms the presence of substantial and dynamic phenotypic variation within genetically discrete color morphs, and demonstrates its relevance for the evolutionary potential of populations to respond to environmental change.",NA,biorxiv

Novel classes of antibiotics are only slowly being developed and alternative strategies are needed to tackle the issue. Mobile genetic elements and class 1 integrons are important facilitators for antibiotic resistance genes, with the latter being highly conserved in human pathogens. The growing prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and the paucity in the development of new antibiotics underscore the urgent need for innovative approaches in the treatment of pathogens. Among these, CRISPR-Cas nucleases can be used to cleave acquired resistance genes, leading to either plasmid curing or cell death if the target is on a chromosome. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using class 1 integrons as a target for Cas9-based cleavage leading to re-sensitizing antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We analyze the conserved and widespread integrase gene intI1 and conclude that it is a suitable target for Cas-based re-sensitization due to its high sequence conservation and its occurrence largely limited to human pathogens, alleviating the risk of targeting benign bacteria.

Incorporating these aspects of the breeders equation, we performed a resurrection study with the scarlet monkeyflower (Mimulus cardinalis) to evaluate whether traits associated with drought adaptation have evolved in populations across a species range in response to extreme drought. We compared trait and fitness differences of pre-drought ancestors and post-drought descendants from six populations transplanted into three latitudinally-arrayed common gardens and quantified phenotypic selection and trait heritabilities. The strength, direction, and mode of selection varied among traits and gardens. Trait heritabilities were relatively low, and did not differ dramatically among populations or gardens. Overall, instances of evolutionary responses between ancestors and descendants were few and small in magnitude, but the magnitude of these evolutionary differences varied among gardens. Together, these results suggest that the expression of genetic variation, and thus traits, depend on the environment, and that environmental variability in field settings may mask the genetic variation that is often detected in greenhouse environments.",NA,biorxiv

In the olfactory bulb (OB), immature adult-born neurons respond differently to olfactory stimuli compared to their more mature counterparts, and have heightened levels of activity-dependent plasticity. These distinct functional features are thought to bestow unique properties onto existing circuitry. OB interneurons, including those generated through adult neurogenesis, consist of a set of highly distinct subtypes. However, we do not currently know the different cell-type-specific mechanisms underlying their functional development and plastic potential. Here, we specifically characterised electrophysiological maturation and experience-dependent plasticity in a single, defined subtype of adult-born OB neuron: dopaminergic cells. We selectively live-labelled both adult-born and  resident dopaminergic cells, and targeted them for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acute mouse OB slices. Surprisingly, we found that from the time - at [~]1 month of cell age - that live adult-born dopaminergic neurons could first be reliably identified, they already possessed almost fully mature intrinsic firing properties. We saw significant maturation only in increased spontaneous activity and decreased medium afterhyperpolarisation amplitude. Nor were adult-born dopaminergic cells especially plastic. In response to brief sensory deprivation via unilateral naris occlusion we observed no maturation-specific plastic alterations in intrinsic properties, although we did see deprivation-associated increases in spike speed and amplitude across all adult-born and resident neurons. Our results not only show that adult-born OB dopaminergic cells rapidly functionally resemble their pre-existing counterparts, but also underscore the importance of subtype identity when describing neuronal maturation and plasticity.",NA,biorxiv

Key examples include the evolution of multicellularity, eusociality, and obligate endosymbiosis. Programmed Cell Death (PCD) has been proposed to play an important role during major transitions to multicellularity, yet it remains unclear to what extent PCD plays a role in other major transitions. Here we test if PCD was involved in the major transition to eusociality in ants, where solitary individuals united to form eusocial colonies with a division of labor between a winged queen caste and a wingless worker caste. The development of wings in queens but not in workers in response to environmental cues is called wing polyphenism, which evolved once and is a general feature of ants. Both wing polyphenism and eusociality evolved at the same time during the origin of ants and were likely intimately linked--the suppression of wings in workers may have reduced their ability to participate in mating flights thereby reinforcing the reproductive division of labor within the parental nest. We therefore tested whether PCD plays a role in the degeneration of wings during development of the worker caste across the ant phylogeny encompassing species with both ancestral-like and derived characteristics. We show that PCD, mediated by the apoptosis pathway, is present in the degenerating wing primordia of worker larvae in 15 out of the 16 species tested. Using ancestral state reconstruction, we infer a role for PCD in regulating wing polyphenism in the last common ancestor of all extant ants. Our findings provide evidence that a degenerative mechanism (PCD) plays a role in the origin of wing polyphenism, and therefore, in facilitating the major transition to eusociality in ants. PCD may generally play a key role in the evolution of biological complexity by facilitating major transitions at different scales, such as multicellularity and eusociality.",NA,biorxiv

Given the importance of timing to most behaviors, disruptions in temporal processing and timed performance are reported in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders such as Schizophrenia, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), and Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Symptoms that implicitly include disruption in timing are atypical turn-taking during social interactions, unusual verbal intonations, poor reading, speech and language skills, inattention, delays in learning, and difficulties making predictions. Currently, there are no viable treatments for these symptoms, the reason being the underlying neural dysfunction that contributes to timing deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders is unknown. To address this unknown, we have designed a novel Temporal Pattern Discrimination Task (TPSD) for awake-behaving mice. Stimuli consist of audiovisual stimuli that differ in duration. Compared to Wild-Type (WT) mice, Fmr1-/- mice, a well-established mouse model of FXS, showed significant impairment in learning the TPSD task, as evidenced by reduced discriminability indices and atypical licking patterns. Often sensory information is multimodal and indeed studies show that learning in humans and rodents improves with multimodal stimuli than with unimodal stimuli. To test how the multimodal nature of stimuli impacted performance of Fmr1-/- mice, following training on the audiovisual stimuli, we tested mice on audio-only or visual-only stimuli. While WT mice showed significant disruption in performance when tested on unimodal stimuli, Fmr1-/- mice displayed equivalent performance on visual-only stimuli when compared to the multimodal task.

Their scarcity could not be attributed to burst size, which was comparable to other phages in vitro, but may result from ecological constraints or fitness trade-offs, such as their preference for targeting generalist vibrios in seawater rather than the patho-phylotypes selected in oyster farms. Our findings clarify the genetic and ecological trade-offs shaping Schizotequatrovirus generalism and provide a foundation for future phage applications in aquaculture and beyond.",NA,biorxiv

These emotions are induced by multimodal stimuli such as taste, olfactory, and somatosensory inputs, and their dysregulation is evident in various psychiatric disorders. To understand the biological basis of liking and disgust, it is crucial to establish an animal model that allows for quantitative estimation of liking and disgust in response to multimodal stimuli. The only readout shared by many species, including humans, for liking and disgust, has been taste reactivity. However, readouts of non-taste stimuli-induced emotions remain unestablished. Here, we show that intraoral administration of capsaicin, a chemosomatosensory stimulus, elicits orofacial and bodily reactions in male mice similar to those observed in taste reactivity. Capsaicin induced liking reactions at low concentrations and disgust reactions at high concentrations. Capsaicin-induced disgust reactions consisted of various reactions, including gape and forelimb flail, with the proportion of each reaction among the disgust reactions being similar to that induced by bitter and sour stimuli. These findings indicate that orofacial and bodily reactions, defined as taste reactivity, are elicited not only by taste stimuli, but also by intraoral chemosomatosensory stimuli. Understanding the biological basis of capsaicin-induced orofacial and bodily reactions will advance our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying liking and disgust across sensory modalities.",10.1093/chemse/bjaf006,biorxiv

However, our limited understanding of their functional sequence features prevents the interpretation of enhancer mutations in disease.

Focusing on seven enhancers active in the developing brain, heart, limb and face, we created over 1700 transgenic mice for over 260 mutagenized enhancer alleles. Systematic mutation of 12-basepair blocks collectively altered each sequence feature in each enhancer at least once. We show that 69% of all blocks are required for normal in vivo activity, with mutations more commonly resulting in loss (60%) than in gain (9%) of function. Using predictive modeling, we annotated critical nucleotides at base-pair resolution. The vast majority of motifs predicted by these machine learning models (88%) coincided with changes to in vivo function, and the models showed considerable sensitivity, identifying 59% of all functional blocks.

While daptomycin has been a cornerstone for treating MRSA bacteremia and vancomycin-refractory infective endocarditis, the emergence of DNS-MRSA presents a significant challenge due to high morbidity, mortality, and rapid intrinsic resistance development.

MethodsPhages Intesti13 and Sb-1, were selected for their unique host ranges and activity against sixteen DNS-MRSA strains. Synergy with antibiotics was assessed via growth suppression curves and 24-hour time-kill assays (TKAs) across administration sequences and MIC increments. Selected regimens were further assessed in an ex-vivo simulated endocardial vegetation (SEV) models, with pharmacokinetic analyses confirming target antibiotic concentrations.

ResultsIn the ex-vivo SEV model, simultaneous PAC administration using daptomycin{+/-}phage, showed superior bactericidal activity over sequential treatments in isolate C6 (p<0.01). Similarly, in the same model, C2 reached detection limits within 48h and remained suppressed for 120h (p<0.0037). Sequential outcomes varied by phage-antibiotic order and antibiotic choice. Simultaneous and phage-first regimens outperformed antibiotic-first, especially in 24h TKAs, but showed variability at lower MICs and between in-vitro and ex-vivo settings.

ConclusionThis study highlights PACs potential for DNS-MRSA treatment, emphasizing the importance of administration timing. The observed differences across clinical strains emphasize the need for strain-specific evaluations and a deeper understanding of phage-antibiotic interactions to optimize therapy. Future research must focus on expanding phage diversity, refining protocols, and clinically validating sequential strategies to enhance PAC efficacy.",NA,biorxiv

While animals typically shape their cells using the actin cytoskeleton, fungi control cell shape through polarized deposition of new cell wall material, which is inflated by intracellular osmotic ""turgor"" pressure. Understanding where and when these mechanisms evolved is essential for understanding the evolution of cell morphogenesis. To this end, we study chytrid fungi, which have a cell type that lacks a cell wall (the ""zoospore"") and a cell type that has a cell wall (the ""sporangium""). While chytrid sporangia rely on polarized cell wall growth to control shape, we previously showed that the ""frog-killing"" chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) uses actin to control zoospore shape. Whether either zoospores or sporangia also use intracellular pressure regulation in cell shape control remains an open question. Here, we use live-cell imaging, environmental perturbations, and small molecule inhibitors to show that Bd sporangia generate and maintain turgor pressure, while Bd zoospores use specialized organelles called contractile vacuoles to pump water out of the cell, thereby keeping internal pressure low. Because chytrid fungi diverged prior to the evolution of the Dikarya--the fungal group comprising yeast, mushrooms, and filamentous fungi--these findings suggest that turgor pressure evolved early, and that cell morphogenesis underwent a major transition during early fungal evolution. We also suggest that the last common fungal ancestor may have, like chytrid fungi, employed stage-specific strategies for cell shape control--illustrating how developmental flexibility in cellular mechanisms can serve as a wellspring of evolutionary innovation.",NA,biorxiv

In the mammalian retina, divergence of cone signals into multiple feedforward bipolar cell pathways forms the initial basis for parallel retinal circuits dedicated to specific visual functions. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy and two photon imaging of a fluorescent glutamate sensor to examine how kinetically-distinct responses arise in transient versus sustained ON alpha RGCs (ON-T and ON-S RGCs) of the mouse retina. We directly compared the visual response properties of these RGCs with their presynaptic bipolar cell partners, which we identified using 3D electron microscopy reconstruction. Different ON bipolar cell subtypes (type 5i, type 6 and type 7) had indistinguishable light-driven responses whereas extracellular glutamate signals around RGC dendrites and postsynaptic excitatory currents measured in ON-T and ON-S RGCs in response to the identical stimuli used to probe bipolar cells were kinetically distinct. Anatomical examination of the bipolar cell axon terminals presynaptic to ON-T and ON-S RGCs suggests that bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools may contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics. Our findings indicate that feedforward bipolar cell synapses are a primary point of divergence in kinetically distinct visual pathways.",NA,biorxiv

The ERBS anchoring differential chromatin loops with either a genes promoter or distal regions were correlated with larger transcriptional responses to estrogen compared to ERBS not involved in differential 3D genome interactions. To functionally test this observation, CRISPR- based Enhancer-i was used to deactivate specific ERBS, which revealed a wide range of effects on the transcriptional response to estrogen. However, these effects are only subtly and not significantly stronger for ERBS in differential chromatin loops. In addition, we observed an enrichment of 3D genome interactions between the promoters of estrogen upregulated genes and found that looped promoters can work together cooperatively. Overall, our work reveals that estrogen treatment causes large changes in 3D genome structure in endometrial cancer cells; however, these changes are not required for a regulatory region to contribute to an estrogen transcriptional response.",10.1101/gr.279699.124,biorxiv

Recent studies show that it also regulates neuronal physiology in the healthy brain. Whether A{beta} also regulates glial physiology in the normal brain, however, has remained unclear. In this article, we describe the discovery of a novel signaling pathway activated by the monomeric form of A{beta} in vitro that plays essential roles in the regulation of microglial activity and the assembly of neocortex during development in vivo. We find that activation of this pathway depends on the function of amyloid precursor (APP) and the heterotrimeric G protein regulator Ric8a in microglia and inhibits microglial immune activation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Genetic disruption of this pathway during neocortical development results in microglial dysregulation and excessive matrix proteinase activation, leading to basement membrane degradation, neuronal ectopia, and laminar disruption. These results uncover a previously unknown function of A{beta} as a negative regulator of brain microglia and substantially elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Considering the prominence of A{beta} and neuroinflammation in the pathology of Alzheimers disease, they also highlight a potentially overlooked role of A{beta} monomer depletion in the development of the disease.",NA,biorxiv

Using atomistic MD simulation and enhanced sampling, we uncover the molecular origins of PX-DNAs superior resistance over JX-DNA and dsDNA. Our findings reveal that PX-DNAs six crossover points induce an overtwisted helix and narrower minor groove, leading to reduced DNase I binding affinity ([~] +5 kcal/mol for PX-DNA vs. [~] -17 kcal/mol for dsDNA). Mechanical properties, such as the stretch modulus ({gamma}G), confirm enhanced structural rigidity of PX-DNA (4805 pN), while residence time calculations using{tau} -RAMD further highlight shorter residence time of DNase I nuclease on PX-DNA. This is the first theoretical study to explore crossover-dependent biostability, mechanical properties, and residence time of PX/JX nanostructures in the presence of a nuclease using enhanced sampling.

Yet, little is known about how fungal networks are structured on the one hand by fungal responses to their environment (including their host plant) and on the other by responses to each other. We quantified changes in plant-fungus networks along geographic and environmental gradients across the Arctic, assessing the degree to which plants and fungi showed preference for specific interaction partners and how specificity varies along environmental gradients. To this aim, we sampled roots of 12 widely distributed plant taxa: Saxifraga oppositifolia; Bistorta vivipara; Dryas spp.; Vaccinium tis-idaea; Vaccinium uliginosum; Vaccinium myrtillus; Empetrum nigrum; Betula nana; alix arctica; Salix polaris; Cassiope tetragona; and Silene acaulis. To quantify the pool of fungi from which plant roots may recruit association partners, we also sampled fungi in the surrounding soil. Identifying fungaI communities by DNA metabarcoding, we used Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) to assess how fungal communities change along environmental gradients, and whether plants actively select their root-associated fungi from the pool of fungi present in the bulk soil. We found that although the fungal communities within the soil and rhizosphere share 85% of genera, their composition differs significantly from each other. The two community types show similar responses to the environment and taxa show low partner fidelity. Thus, the structure of fungal communities on plant rhizosphere is mainly driven by abiotic rather than biotic conditions. Overall, in comparison with null models, networks of plants and rhizosphere-associated fungi showed a distinctly non-random structure, responding strongly to pH and temperature gradients. Our findings suggest that the dynamics and structure of plant-root associated interactions might be severely altered by abiotic changes in the rapidly changing arctic environment.

Despite a rising global incidence, the underlying causes and optimal management strategies for pediatric IBD are still not fully understood. Compared to adult IBD, pediatric IBD frequently presents with distinct disease phenotypes, and is more commonly linked to rare monogenic variants that cause intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction or affect the function of mucosal immune cells. While more than 100 genes have been associated with early-onset IBD, the roles of many of these genes in the intestinal epithelium and the mechanisms by which genetic variants contribute to disease remain poorly defined.

Here we aimed to improve our understanding of intestinal epithelium dysfunction in early-onset IBD by conducting extensive molecular and cellular characterization to gain insights into patient-specific epithelial phenotypes and identify therapeutic targets. We generated intestinal epithelial organoids (IEOs) from 94 pediatric IBD patients, representing diverse clinical characteristics and including those with monogenic variants (BTK n=4, TTC7A n=3, IL10RA n=1, LRBA n=1, STXBP2 n=1, TTC37 n=1, TRNT1 n=1, PLCG2 n=1, DKC1 n=1, POLA1 n=1), and 46 non-IBD controls. This effort resulted in the largest RNA-seq dataset of pediatric IBD intestinal epithelial organoids to date, encompassing both baseline conditions and post-immunological stimulation, serving as a valuable resource for future research.

We observed that IEOs effectively initiate inflammation upon stimulation with bacterial lysate, regardless of disease status, origin, or mutation status. Inflammatory stimulation triggered single-gene upregulation of IBD-linked SERPINA1 and LIFR across the IBD population compared to controls, suggesting their role in intestinal epithelial innate immune responses. However, co-expression network analysis showed no consistent transcriptional signatures across the entire IBD group at the systems level. Instead, differences emerged between controls and specific genotypes (TTC7A, STXBP2, LRBA), with STXBP2 and LRBA sharing an upregulated transcriptional response of IL-1 and SLC30-mediated zinc trafficking pathways.

These findings underscore the potential of IEOs as a valuable model for studying IBD and offer key insights that could guide the development of targeted therapies for both monogenic and non-monogenic forms of IBD.

Here, we find that cancer-associated mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) can uncouple p53 activity from tumor suppression by perturbing chromatin states that determine target gene expression. Mutant IDH impairs tumor regressions and promotes the outgrowth of cancer cells with transcriptionally active, wild-type p53 in a mouse model of liver cancer where restoration of p53 activity results in tumor clearance. Mutant IDH alters p53 target gene expression through the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an inhibitor of alpha-ketoglutarate (KG)-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes, without preventing p53 accumulation or global genomic binding. Rather, mutant IDH alters chromatin accessibility landscapes that dictate target gene expression, resulting in disabled upregulation of targets that execute tumor suppression. Specifically, mutant IDH disrupts the expression of pro-apoptotic p53 targets that enable p53-dependent tumor regressions, including the death ligand receptor Fas. Pharmacological inhibition of mutant IDH in TP53 wild-type cholangiocarcinoma cells, a tumor type where p53 and IDH mutations are mutually exclusive, potentiates p53 target gene expression and sensitizes cells to Fas ligand and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we implicate the disruption of p53 target gene regulation as a reversible, oncogenic feature of cancer-associated IDH mutations.

SIGNIFICANCEWe find that chromatin states altered by cancer-associated IDH mutations intersect with transcriptional regulation of p53 target genes. This reversible interaction may represent a strategy to reinvigorate latent tumor suppression in IDH mutant, p53 wild-type tumors.",NA,biorxiv

How these relationships differ between brain areas and cell types, and how they relate to somatosensory signal detection and decision making, are not well understood. We used high density microelectrode arrays to chronically record neural activity from somatosensory cortex, prefrontal cortex, striatum, and amygdala in mice performing a head-fixed whisker-based selective detection task. We observed strong spontaneous alpha phase modulation of single neuron spiking activity as mice performed the task. The prevalence and strength of alpha phase modulation differed significantly across regions and between cell types. Phase-modulated neurons exhibited greater changes in spiking activity during task execution than their unmodulated counterparts. Furthermore, alpha modulation of neuronal spiking during baseline activity correlated with task performance. In particular, many neurons selectively exhibited strong alpha modulation of spiking activity prior to correct trials, but not prior to incorrect trials. These data suggest that dysregulation of spiking activity with respect to the ongoing alpha oscillation may characterize lapses in task engagement or attention.",NA,biorxiv

It remains a major public health challenge in the endemic region around the Bay of Bengal. Over decadal time scales, one lineage typically dominates the others and spreads in global pandemic waves. However, it remains unclear to what extent diverse lineages co-circulate during a single outbreak season. Defining the pool of diversity during finer time scales is important because the selective pressures that impact V. cholerae - namely antibiotics and phages - are dynamic on these time scales. To study the nationwide diversity of V. cholerae, we long-read sequenced 273 V. cholerae genomes from seven hospitals over one year (2018) in Bangladesh. Four major V. cholerae lineages were identified: known lineages BD-1, BD-2a, and BD-2b, and a novel lineage that we call BD-3. In 2022, BD-1 caused a large cholera outbreak in Dhaka, apparently outcompeting BD-2 lineages. We show that, in 2018, BD-1 was already dominant in the five northern regions, including Dhaka, consistent with an origin from India in the north. By contrast, we observed a higher diversity of lineages in the two southern regions near the coast. The four lineages differed in pangenome content, including integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and genes involved in resistance to bacteriophages and antibiotics. Notably, BD-2a lacked an ICE and is predicted to be more sensitive to phages and antibiotics, but nevertheless persisted throughout the year-long sampling period. Genes associated with antibiotic resistance in V. cholerae from Bangladesh in 2006 were entirely absent from all lineages in 2018-19, suggesting shifting costs and benefits of encoding these genes. Together, our results highlight the dynamic nature of the V. cholerae pangenome and the geographic structure of its lineage diversity.",NA,biorxiv

Using scRNA-seq and high- parameter flow cytometry, we uncovered a unique signature for VT NK cells, indicating a reduced effector phenotype with increased factors related to tissue residency and immunoregulation at steady state. Despite their functionally quiescent nature, these cells were able to respond robustly to inflammatory signals, suggesting they are poised for pathogen response. We found that the gene signatures between mouse and human NK cells were remarkably similar, demonstrating the feasibility of using a mouse model to probe distinct NK cell functions during mucosal infection. In mice, VT NK cells responded robustly to acute HSV-2 infection and retained an enhanced recall potential after viral clearance. They also secreted tissue repair factors and played a role in restricting tissue damage following viral infection.

We aimed to combine open-source genetic, environmental, and geographic information to analyze patterns of bat phylogenetic diversity (PD) in continuous ecoregions across the globe. This information is important for developing bat conservation strategies, and our methodology can work with any taxa that has sufficient georeferenced genetic data available.

LocationGlobal.

Time periodLast Interglacial to Present Day.

Major taxa studiedChiroptera.

MethodsAfter curating a global dataset containing 14,037 COI DNA sequences from 343 described species of bats, we calculated PD for two sets of continuous ecoregions at different spatial scales. To avoid the possible difficulties of using current species names, we used genetic OTUs identified by a single-locus species delimitation method to calculate PD. We then estimated a lineage through time plot and used random forest predictive modeling to identify the environmental and geographic predictors of PD.

ResultsWe found that temperature variables were most closely associated with PD. In addition to temperature during the present, temperature during the last glacial maxima and temperature changes since the last interglacial were deemed important. However, when looking at different spatial scales, top variables differed slightly. Southeast Asia and South America had the highest levels of PD, along with some parts of Africa and the Himalayas. We demonstrate that, regardless of spatial scale and uneven sampling across the globe, single-locus genetic data is enough to reflect species diversity gradients.

Main conclusionsWe show that publicly available, single-locus data can be used to analyze large-scale evolutionary patterns and inform effective and efficient conservation efforts. Additionally, choice of biodiversity measure and spatial scale matter when assessing species patterns. When looking at bats, temperature variables with a historical component are most important for predicting PD.",NA,biorxiv

Though methods to observe flying insects have consistently improved in the last decades, insects remain difficult to monitor systematically and consistently over large spatial and temporal scales. Remote sensing with radars has proved to be one of the more effective tools for observation. However, as radars are most sensitive to targets similar in size to the radar wavelength, the detectable sub-group of aerial insects of a certain size range depends on the employed radar. Here, we present a novel method based on data of a zenith-pointing W-band (94 GHz,{lambda} = 0.32 cm) Doppler cloud radar to estimate insect concentration in a vertical profile. Multiple meteorological state-of-the-art algorithms are combined to extract insect signals from the radar data and quantify their abundance from 50 m to 1000 m above the ground. For evaluation, this method is applied to Doppler cloud radar data from a summertime 30 day observation period in central Germany. Results are compared to data from an X-band (9.4 GHz,{lambda} = 3.2 cm) radar in the same region. Aerial insect concentration derived from the W-band radar, which is sensitive to insects in the mm size range, is substantially higher than from the X-band radar, detecting insects in the cm size range. In addition, diel flight timings vary between the different sub-groups of aerial insects observed by the two radar instruments. With its superior sensitivity to smaller insects like aphids, the proposed methodology complements existing entomological radar techniques and contributes to achieving a more complete description of aerial insect activity.",NA,biorxiv

Instead of capturing molecules released from the tissue, probes are detached from a pre-decoded bead array and diffused into tissues, tagging nuclei with spatial barcodes. We reanalyzed this data and discovered a latent, spatially informative cell-bead network formed incidentally from barcode diffusion and the biophysical properties of the tissue.

In this study, we explored whether hypernucleosome formation is a conserved feature of canonical archaeal histones. Moreover, to further elucidate how hypernucleosomes are regulated, we also explored how changes in the physico-chemical conditions, particularly the presence of Mg2+, influence the hypernucleosome. Using a combination of Tethered Particle Motion (TPM) and single-molecule force spectroscopy, we established that T. kodakarensis histones assemble into hypernucleosomes on DNA, similar to the M. fervidus histones HMfA and HMfB, the only canonical histones structurally characterized in previous studies.

In patients presenting with Hunter Syndrome, clinical testing for IDS enzyme activity has been the mainstay to determine whether a variant is likely damaging. However, these enzyme assays are unable to predict disease severity or neuronal toxicity and may be missing many aspects of IDS pathology. In this study, we have developed an image-based assay using genome-engineered cells with IDS mutations to identify if a specific mutation causes lysosomal and membrane disruptions that characterize the disease. Specifically, we generate twelve mutant cell lines and document both the biochemical changes in IDS activity and the reproducible phenotypic differences therein. Next, we examine two patient-derived cell lines and find the same phenotypic differences in these lines compared to parental controls. The phenotypic changes are measured on a specific scale, which we term the PathScoreLC. To determine whether the observed changes are specific to IDS, we reintroduce a recombinant version of the IDS enzyme (rhIDS) to rescue both the biochemical and phenotypic changes of these cells. Interestingly, even after 120 hours, rescue is present, but not all the cells return to normal, which may also reflect the pathological state. Finally, we examine the gene expression differences and find that recombinant enzyme is not sufficient to induce transcriptional changes in the mutant lines at the time points studied.

In Drosophila, MT stability, polarity, abundance, and orientation undergo dynamic changes across developmental stages. In our effort to identify novel microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that regulate MTs in the Drosophila ovary, we identified a previously uncharacterized gene, CG18190, encoding a novel MT end-binding (EB) protein, which we propose to name EB-SUN. We show that EB-SUN colocalizes with EB1 at growing microtubule plus-ends in Drosophila S2 cells. Tissue-specific and developmental expression profiles from Paralog Explorer reveal that EB-SUN is predominantly expressed in the ovary and early embryos, while EB1 is ubiquitously expressed. Furthermore, as early as oocyte determination, EB-SUN comets are highly concentrated in oocytes during oogenesis. EB-SUN knockout (KO) results in a decrease in MT density at the onset of mid-oogenesis (Stage 7) and delays oocyte growth during late mid-oogenesis (Stage 9). Combining EB-SUN KO with EB1 knockdown (KD) in germ cells significantly further reduced MT density at Stage 7. Notably, all eggs from EB-SUN KO/EB1 KD females fail to hatch, unlike single gene depletion, suggesting a functional redundancy between these two EB proteins during embryogenesis. Our findings indicate that EB-SUN and EB1 play distinct roles during early embryogenesis.

However, the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms maintaining this homeostasis remain poorly understood. Biallelic recurrent loss of function mutations in C12ORF57, an evolutionarily conserved X amino acid novel open reading frame, underlie Temtamy syndrome (TS)--a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by epilepsy, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, and severe intellectual disability.

MethodsThrough multiple lines of inquiry, we establish that C12ORF57/GRCC10 plays an unexpected central role in synaptic homeostatic downscaling in response to elevated activity, uncovering a novel mechanism for neuronal excitatory homeostasis. To probe these mechanisms, we developed a new knockout (KO) mouse model of the genes murine ortholog, Grcc10 as well as cellular and in vitro assays.

ResultsGrcc10 KO mice exhibit the characteristic phenotypic features seen in human TS patients, including increased epileptiform activity. Corresponding with the enhanced seizure susceptibility, hippocampal neurons in these mice exhibited significantly increased AMPA receptor expression levels and higher amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). We further found that GRCC10/C12ORF57 modulates the activity of calcium/calmodulin dependent kinase 4 (CAMK4) and thereby regulates the expression of CREB and ARC.

We demonstrate that the N-terminal ParA-binding motif of ParB associates with a conserved bipartite binding pocket at the ParA dimer interface, in a manner dependent on ParB clamp closure. Moreover, we show that ParB and non-specific DNA interact cooperatively with ParA and synergistically induce structural changes at its Walker A and Walker B motifs that correlate with the activation of ParA ATPase activity. These results advance our understanding of the mechanism underlying DNA transport by the ParABS system and may help to unravel the mode of action of related cargo-positioning systems.",NA,biorxiv

The effectiveness of such mitigation effect and relevant potential application in cryo-EM remain to be explored. Herein, we built an ultrafast cryo-EM (cryo-UEM) device based on an ultrafast laser system. Using such equipment and the saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds (C44H90), the fading curves of diffraction intensity and corresponding critical electron doses (Ne) of the samples were carefully measured under different imaging modes, temperatures, imaging dose rates and pulsed repetition rates. Our experimental results show that, the fading curves and Ne values of the C44H90 crystals are uncorrelated with the imaging electron dose rates and do not show dependence on the dose-rate effect. As the temperature decreased, the Ne values of the sample increased, indicating the cryoprotective effect on radiation damage to the samples. Surprisingly, at a constant temperature, the fading curves and Ne values of the sample in multi-electrons-packet and near-single-electron-packet pulsed modes are all approximately the same as those in conventional continuous electron-beam mode, even when the results are obtained at different pulsed repetition rates. These results show that the time-modulated pulsed electron beam does not seem to mitigate the electron radiation damage that occurs on samples. Our findings offer new insights and experimental basis for the radiation damage behavior of samples under electron beams, and provide guidance and inspiration for elucidating the fundamental principles of radiation damage.",NA,biorxiv

This is pronounced for aerial hawking bat species, for which prey activity is highly dependent on ambient temperature. Here, we describe changes in activity of female Eptesicus nilssonii, the northernmost breeding bat species, during gestation and lactation over several years at a roost site in southern Norway (60.1{degrees}N). Roost exits and returns were recorded using an infrared barrier at the entrance, and parturition dates were registered via a camera set inside the roost. Our results indicate significant temporal changes in body mass and behaviour throughout the breeding season. Lactating bats both setting out to forage earlier than during gestation and returning later. This behaviour is dependent on ambient temperature, with bats extending foraging time at elevated temperatures. These behaviours may occur as a response to the increased energetic needs of lactation, and the effect of increased temperature to reflect increased food availability which allows females to avoid increased predation pressure as a consequence of advanced roost exit or delayed return. The mass of females also decreases during lactation, suggesting high energetic demands during this period. Our study reveals insights into underlying mechanisms in high latitude insectivorous bats that can assist in coping with a short season with fluctuating resources.",NA,biorxiv

To uncover these rules, it is first necessary to find the binding sites within a regulatory region with high precision, and then to systematically modulate this binding site arrangement while simultaneously measuring the effect of this modulation on output gene expression. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), where the gene expression stemming from 10,000s of in vitro-generated regulatory sequences is measured, have made this feat possible in high-throughput in single cells in culture. However, because of lack of technologies to incorporate DNA libraries, MPRAs are limited in whole organisms. To enable MPRAs in multicellular organisms, we generated tools to create a high degree of mutagenesis in specific genomic loci in vivo using base editing. Targeting GFP integrated in the genome of Drosophila cell culture and whole animals as a case study, we show that the base editor AIDevoCDA1 stemming from sea lamprey fused to nCas9 is highly mutagenic. Surprisingly, longer gRNAs increase mutation efficiency and expand the mutating window, which can allow the introduction of mutations in previously untargetable sequences. Finally, we demonstrate arrays of >20 gRNAs that can efficiently introduce mutations along a 200bp sequence, making it a promising tool to test enhancer function in vivo in a high throughput manner.",NA,biorxiv

To address this, we used advanced immuno-freeze-etch electron microscopy to visualise the vRNP packaging process and atomic force live-cell imaging (AFM) to examine the motility of membrane cytoskeletal actin filaments. In the cytoplasm, vRNPs were mainly localised on mottled membrane-like structures, suggesting intracellular trafficking through such structures. After reaching the cytoplasmic side surface of the plasma membrane, vRNPs formed many aggregates while associating with actin filaments. Antibody labelling also detected myosin along actin filaments entangled in vRNPs. Blocking myosin activity with blebbistatin prevented the active movement of membrane cytoskeletal actin filaments just below the plasma membrane visualised by AFM and abrogated proper aggregation of vRNPs. Thus, actomyosin motility appears to be crucial for the selective packaging of vRNPs.",NA,biorxiv

Dose selection of trimer-based bispecifics poses a unique challenge, as toxicity increases with dose, but efficacy does not. Instead, trimer-driven bispecifics have a bell-shaped efficacy curve, for which both under- and over-dosing can cause a decrease in efficacy. To address the challenge of dose selection for trimer-based bispecifics, we develop a semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model of one such bispecific, teclistamab. By introducing variability in key patient-specific parameters, we find that the currently selected phase II recommended dose of 1.5 mg/kg administered subcutaneously weekly falls within the calculated optimal range for maximizing concentration of the pharmacologically active trimer for a broad population. We next explore different strategies for patient stratification based on pre-treatment levels of measurable biomarkers. We discover that significantly more variability across subpopulations is predicted when the drug is administered every two weeks as compared to weekly administration, and that higher doses generally result in more interpatient variability. Further, the pharmacologically active trimers are predicted to be maximized at different doses for different subpopulations. These findings underscore the potential for model-supported patient stratification based on measurable biomarkers, offering a middle ground between population-level approaches and fully personalized medicine.",NA,biorxiv

Among various interventions to slow the aging process, caloric restriction (CR) has consistently demonstrated the ability to extend lifespan and enhance brain function across different species. Yet the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms by which CR benefits the aging brain remain elusive, especially at region-specific and cell type-specific resolution. In this study, we performed spatiotemporal profiling of mouse brains to elucidate the detailed mechanisms driving the anti-aging effects of CR. Utilizing highly scalable single-nucleus genomics and spatial transcriptomics platforms, EasySci and IRISeq, we profiled over 500,000 cells from 36 mouse brains across three age groups and conducted spatial transcriptomic analysis on twelve brain sections from aged mice under CR and control conditions. This comprehensive approach allowed us to explore the impact of CR on over 300 cellular states and assess region-specific molecular alterations. Our findings reveal that CR effectively modulates key aging-associated changes, notably by delaying the expansion of inflammatory cell populations and preserving cells critical to the neurovascular system and myelination pathways. Moreover, CR significantly reduced the expression of aging-associated genes involved in oxidative stress, unfolded protein stress, and DNA damage stress across various cell types and regions. A notable reduction in senescence-associated genes and restoration of circadian rhythm genes were observed, particularly in ventricles and white matter. Furthermore, CR exhibited region-specific restoration in genes linked to cognitive function and myelin maintenance, underscoring its targeted effects on brain aging.

Full kinetic characterization showed that each substitution enhanced the CO2 affinity of GWS1B under oxygenic conditions by subduing oxygen affinity, leading to 25% (E40K), 11% (T29A) and 8% (R337C) enhancements in carboxylation efficiency under ambient O2 at 25 {degrees}C. By contrast, under the near anaerobic natural environment of Gallionellaceae, the carboxylation efficiency of each mutant was impaired [~]16%. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of artificial directed evolution to access novel regions of catalytic space in Rubisco.

SignificanceGiven Rubiscos crucial role in carbon dioxide assimilation, addressing its slow carboxylation rate and oxygen inhibition is a significant challenge. Utilizing one of the fastest known, yet also highly oxygen-sensitive, Rubisco - from the bacteria Gallionellaceae - we applied a novel in vivo directed evolution pipeline in Escherichia coli to discover mutations that specifically enhance carboxylation efficiency under ambient oxygen, a condition distinct from Gallionellaceaes natural semi-anaerobic environment. Our findings underscore the potential of directed evolution to unlock new catalytic capabilities for Rubisco, with implications for both fundamental research and practical agricultural applications.",NA,biorxiv

Astyanax mexicanus is a species of fish with populations of surface fish that inhabit rivers and streams and cavefish that have adapted to life within caves. Cavefish have evolved sensory system changes relative to their surface fish counterparts, providing an opportunity to investigate mechanisms underlying sensory system evolution. Here, we report the role of the gene retinal homeobox 3 (rx3) in cavefish eye evolution. We generated surface fish with putative loss-of-function mutations in the rx3 gene using CRISPR-Cas9 to determine the role of this gene in eye development in this species. These rx3 mutant surface fish fail to develop eyes, demonstrating that rx3 is required for surface fish eye development. Further, rx3 mutant surface fish exhibit altered behaviors relative to wild-type surface fish, suggesting that the loss of eyes impacts sensory-dependent behaviors. Finally, eye development is altered in cave-surface hybrid fish that inherit the mutant allele of rx3 from surface fish relative to siblings that inherit a wild-type surface fish rx3 allele, suggesting that cis-regulatory variation at the rx3 locus contributes to eye size evolution in cavefish. Together, these findings demonstrate that, as in other species, rx3 is required for eye development in A. mexicanus. Moreover, they suggest that variation at the rx3 locus plays a role in the evolved reduction of eye size in cavefish, shedding light on the genetic mechanisms underlying sensory system evolution in response to extreme environmental changes.",NA,biorxiv

These studies have yielded remarkable results for understanding nucleosome transcription by Pol II with elongation factors but may fail to represent transcription in native conditions. To investigate Pol II transcription within metazoan cells, we developed an approach to isolate the native transcription complexes from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Utilizing one-step FLAG-tag affinity purification and mild chromatin treatment with Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase), we preserved the native transcription complex for cryo-EM and proteomics studies. In silico purification through the cryo-EM classifications determined structures of multiple forms of native transcription complex, nucleosome and other macromolecules. Remarkably, we determined the structures of metazoan Rpb4/Rpb7 stalk-less elongation complex as well as hexameric nucleosome lacking an H2A/H2B dimer, revealing that diverse elongation complexes and nucleosomes are involved in active transcription in vivo. Nucleosome is positioned only downstream of Pol II in the nucleosome elongation complex, underscoring it as a major energy barrier and a time-consuming step during Pol II progression through nucleosomal DNA. Proteomics identified co-purified factors responsible for initiation and elongation stages of transcription, as well as RNA modification factors. This study lays the groundwork for structural study of native transcription in eukaryotes, with future work focused on studies of transient and minor populations of transcription complexes.",NA,biorxiv

As a result, counting cells can achieve similar predictive performance as Cell Painting or gene expression data. Filtering benchmarks to include only assays relating to protein targets reveals that Cell Painting can capture information that cannot be predicted by mere cell counting. We re-evaluated three benchmark datasets used with Cell Painting data and observed that, in many cases, cell count models produced an AUC comparable to models using the full Cell Painting profiles. However, in protein-target-specific benchmarks across 17 distinct protein targets, Cell Painting features demonstrated unique predictive power, outperforming mean balanced accuracy from cell count models with a relative improvement of 19.6%. We propose five practical recommendations for benchmarking machine learning models for predicting bioactivity, including using cell count as a baseline feature.

Here, we investigated the aggregation of full-length recombinant 0N3R tau, using wild-type, or mutations C322A or C322S and a real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay with brain homogenate seeding. The assembly of C322A 0N3R tau resulted in filaments with a structure resembling the AD fold in paired helical filaments (PHFs), but with a more open C-shaped core attributed to the C322A mutation. C322S 0N3R tau formed structurally more distinct filaments with respect to PHFs, with an ordered carboxy-terminal region. Both mutant filaments retained the ability to seed a second round of aggregation. Meanwhile, wild-type 0N3R tau exhibited poor reproducibility and formed predominantly unfolded aggregates.

Inhibitory synapses are key regulators of the functional balance of neural circuits. However, due to the diversity of inhibitory presynaptic neurons, the complex composition of postsynaptic receptor subunits and the lack of typical postsynaptic dense structure, there are relatively few studies on the regulatory mechanisms for inhibitory synaptic structure and function, and insufficient understanding of the cellular and molecular abnormalities of inhibitory synapses in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we report a crucial role for endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses. We show that endophilin A1 directly interacts with the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin in excitatory neurons, and promotes organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic density and synaptic recruitment/stabilization of the {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type A receptors via its plasma membrane association and actin polymerization promoting activities. Loss of endophilin A1 by gene knockout in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells weakens inhibitory synaptic transmission and causes imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory function of neural circuits, leading to increased susceptibility to epilepsy. Our findings identify endophilin A1 as an iPSD component and provide new insights into the organization and stabilization of inhibitory postsynapses to maintain E/I balance as well as the pathogenesis of epilepsy.",NA,biorxiv

Fatty acid {beta}-oxidation is the most efficient mechanism for ATP production and serves as a primary energy source for tissues, including the heart and skeletal muscles. However, the metabolic mechanisms underlying arsenics effects on muscle function and pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in arsenic-induced muscular damage using mouse skeletal muscle C2C12 cells. Our results demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of sodium arsenite (0-2 {micro}M, 72 hours) on C2C12 cells proliferation, viability, and differentiation (indicated by reduction of myogenic differentiation 1 mRNA expression). Arsenic exposure disrupted mitochondria through increasing reactive oxygen species production, reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, downregulating mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism-related enzymes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B and choline kinase beta mRNA), and decreasing mitochondrial DNA copy number. These findings suggest that arsenic-induced pathological changes in skeletal muscle are associated with impaired mitochondrial membrane function, disrupted fatty acid metabolism, and reduced mitochondrial DNA content in muscle cells.",10.1371/journal.pone.0320557,biorxiv

HeLLOs are easily established from (small) healthy or diseased liver tissues and rapidly expanded for an extended period in optimized culture conditions. Transcriptomic and functional analyses revealed that differentiated HeLLOs closely resemble fresh primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and perform key hepatic functions such as gluconeogenesis, drug metabolism, and bile acid synthesis. We developed a HeLLO-based toxicity assay with higher sensitivity in predicting liver toxicity of known liver-toxic drugs compared to the gold-standard PHHs. By modeling disease-related mechanisms, such as bile acid transport, HeLLOs uncover transport-inhibition toxicity mechanisms of known liver toxic drugs. Single cell sequencing analysis of HeLLOs identified a heterogeneous cluster of cells with cholangiocyte-like and hepatocyte-like cells, overall resembling liver regenerative cells.

HPC carried more information about experimental phases (acquisition (context A), extinction (context B), and renewal (context A)) than NCL. In addition, hippocampal neurons with mixed selectivity integrated all contextual stimuli and conditioned cues, thereby possibly enabling context integration into phase-dependent extinction events. The mixed selectivity pattern of NCL neurons differed: They encoded all relevant task parameters separately, thereby possibly enabling the weighing and deciding between response alternatives. Repeatedly testing the same animals over many months enabled us to reveal that the activity of NCL neurons increasingly became predictive of the number of responses that animals made during renewal. Thus, NCL neurons possibly assumed a meta-learning ability that enabled a behavioral adaption to the deeper task structure that always followed the sequence of acquisition[-&gt;]extinction[-&gt;]renewal.

Giant anteaters have been found to exhibit conspicuous behavioral responses to temperature changes. Despite their broad thermal neutral zone (15 - 36{degrees}C), climate projections indicate that this vulnerable mammal is increasingly likely to experience heat stress. We used GPS tracking and continuous-time analyses to investigate how environmental temperature influences the movement ecology of giant anteaters. We integrated our findings with climate change projections to link giant anteaters responses to present weather conditions with those expected under future climate scenarios. Giant anteaters movement speed exhibited a negative quadratic response to temperature, peaking at 23.7{degrees}C. 95% of their movement occurred between 15.0 - 32.3{degrees}C, which aligns with their thermal neutral zone. The increasing temperature led giant anteaters to increase selection for native forests, but had no effect on selection for exotic tree plantations. This shows the importance of native forests as these thermal shelters help to mitigate the negative consequences of high temperatures on anteaters movement. However, the warmer temperatures predicted for Brazil throughout the rest of the 21st century indicate that giant anteaters may experience a reduction of up to 84% in their movement speed. This would hinder the acquisition of sufficient energy resources and threaten the species persistence.

Murine HBs can be generated by over-expressing any pairwise or triple combination of mutant forms of these pathways terminal effectors, namely {beta}-catenin (B), YAP (Y) and NFE2L2/NRF (N). Each molecular subtypes displays distinct features resembling those of human HBs. However, research has been hampered by a paucity of established cell lines of any species.

MethodsWe show here that immortalized cell lines can be routinely established from murine HBs that over-express B+Y and B+Y+N. This is facilitated by the concurrent in vivo, Crispr-mediated inactivation of the Cdkn2a tumor suppressor locus.

ResultsEight BY and 3 BYN cell lines have been generated and characterized and are available to the HB research community. Ten of these lines can be regrown as subcutaneous and metastatic lung tumors in the immuno-competent mice from which they originated while retaining their original histologic features. During maintenance as spheroids in vitro, or during in vivo propagation, tumor cells express endothelial cell markers, particularly in regions that are hypoxic and/or in proximity to incipient blood vessels.

ConclusionsThe ability to generate isogenic HB cell lines with defined oncogenic drivers should facilitate studies that are best performed in vitro. The approach may also be useful for deriving HB cell lines associated with less common molecular drivers and from human tumors.

SynopsisThe derivation of multiple immortalized murine hepatoblastoma cell lines driven by defined oncogenes is described.

We investigated how personality relative to human-habituation affects migration behavior. We categorized elk as bold or shy based on use of anthropogenic food resources identified through a clustering algorithm applied to GPS collar data. Bold elk were 4 times more likely to select wintering areas close to human activity and migrated 60% shorter distances compared to shy elk. As a result, elk wintering grounds were spatially structured such that conflict- and disease-prone individuals selected areas adjacent to human activity. Our results suggest that bold personality traits act as a precursor to human-habituation, which permits bold elk to reap the forage and predation rewards that occur in suburban landscapes. A multi-pronged approach beyond just maintaining habitat corridors may be necessary to conserve long-distance migrations for species that can become human-habituated.",NA,biorxiv

C_LIO_LIBy investigating the colonisation of Arabidopsis thaliana by the highly polyphagous peach-potato aphid (Myzus persicae), we identified cell wall-derived DAMPs, specifically oligogalacturonides (OGs), as key in inducing DTI against aphids. The OG-responsive immune components BAK1/BKK1, CPK5/CPK6, GRP3, and EDS1 collectively contribute to DTI limiting aphid colonisation.
C_LIO_LIWe found that aphids limit OG production during feeding. Additionally, the salivary chemosensory protein (CSP) effector Mp10/CSP4, which is known to be delivered into the cytoplasm of plant cells early in aphid attack, inhibits OG-induced DTI.
C_LIO_LIWhile Mp10 suppresses OG-induced DTI, it also interacts with EDS1-mediated defences, enhancing aphid fecundity in the absence of EDS1 but restoring OG responsiveness under attack, revealing its broader role in immune modulation and effector-driven host adaptation.

We analyzed the role of cytohesin-2 in vivo and in vitro and found that cytohesin-2 full knockout mice die within one day after birth. Mass spectrometry-based organellar proteomics in wildtype and CRISPR-Cas9-generated cytohesin-2-/- C2 myoblasts revealed a markedly altered Golgi compartment.

While hyperglutamylation of MTs leads to neurodegeneration and disrupts the function of specific neuronal subtypes like Purkinje cells, cortical neurons, and hippocampal excitatory neurons, little is known about its impact on inhibitory interneurons and their functional integration into local networks. In this study, we generated a conditional knockout mouse model to deplete cytosolic carboxypeptidase 1 (Ccp1) in GABAergic neurons, a key MT deglutamylase expressed by hippocampal interneurons.

Understanding early stress responses is crucial for improving resilience. Salt stress impairs leaf growth and photosynthesis, triggering complex, time-dependent signaling. Sucrose non-fermenting kinase 1 (SnRK1), a central metabolic sensor, regulates metabolism and growth under stress. We investigated the dynamics of SnRK1, sucrose, and trehalose-6- phosphate (Tre6P) during leaf expansion in a salt-tolerant alfalfa cultivar. Plants were hydroponically grown and exposed to 200 mM NaCl. Stress induced transient declines in chloroplast performance (Fv/Fm, performance index). SnRK1 activity peaked within 1 hour post-treatment (hpt), likely initiating metabolic shifts. By 3 hpt, sugar metabolism shifted, with increased catabolism, TCA cycle modulation, and glucose-6-phosphate accumulation. SnRK1 and sucrose showed opposing wave-like patterns, with sucrose peaking at 1 day post-treatment (dpt) as Tre6P declined, indicating a disrupted regulatory link. A second SnRK1 peak at 3 dpt correlated with reduced leaf growth. Exogenous sucrose inhibited SnRK1, while NaCl enhanced it.

We present a novel workflow that merges these individual logical GRN models into more comprehensive ones, providing a broader view of gene regulation. We applied this workflow to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), a highly aggressive form of blood cancer.

This combines targeted gene enrichment with the contextual insights of long-read sequencing, providing a highly efficient and flexible approach for pathogen detection. In this initial version, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes are utilized as marker genes that improve sequencing sensitivity. This allowed the detection of bacteria in broiler caecal content samples that carried resistance genes for critical antibiotics, including macrolides and quinolones. These specific AMR genes would have remained undetected when traditional metagenomic shotgun sequencing would have been applied, as it failed to detect these genes and therefore putative pathogens. This demonstrates the potential to detect and characterize pathogens more effectively compared to traditional sequencing strategies. The modular design of CArP furthermore demonstrates expansion with additional marker genes, such as viral or fungal markers, that can enable broader pathogen coverage.

By tightly binding to its ectodomains, these affimers derailed binding of Fc{gamma}RIIIa to Fc portion of IgG leading to latters degradation. This ability to decrease antibody titer suggests use of these affimers as therapeutic interventions in autoimmune conditions like immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) which is caused by autoantibodies against platelets. I queried: are there any small molecules which can dock and lock the ectodomains of Fc{gamma}RIIIa analogous to affimers? Applying MTiOpenScreen on few libraries, I shortlisted 30 drug-like molecules which preferentially docked in the cleft between ectodomains of human Fc{gamma}RIIIa. Their complexes were subsequently analyzed by MD simulations at theoretical pH 7.4 (and 5.7) at 310 K. For all trajectories, we tracked two characteristic molecular descriptors of Fc{gamma}RIIIa: {theta} and {delta}, the angle and distance between the center masses of the two ectodomains, respectively. The values of these descriptors, in conjunction with estimated binding energies from MD simulations allow me to report three new compounds which may act as and/or lead to small molecule interventions in autoimmune conditions like ITP.

Here, we show that although PI 3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated activation of Akt is not significantly reduced in a cell population transfected with a PH-Akt1 PIP3/PI(3,4)P2 biosensor, single cells expressing the PH-Akt at visible levels (used for live-cell imaging) have no activated Akt at all.

In the course of a Myxococcus xanthus predator evolution experiment, we discovered a class of genotypes leading to enhanced predation against diverse species. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that this phenotype is linked to the constitutive activation of a predation-specific program. Functional analysis of the mutations accumulated across the evolutionary time in a two- component system and Acyl-CoA-manipulating enzymes revealed the critical roles of fatty acid metabolism and antioxidant gene induction. The former likely adapts the predator to metabolites derived from the prey while the latter protects predatory cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by prey cells under stress and released upon lysis during predation. These findings reveal interesting parallels between bacterial predator-prey dynamics and pathogen-host cell interactions.

Significance StatementThis study illuminates the largely unexplored genetic and metabolic strategies used by bacterial predators in soil ecosystems. Through experimental evolution in Myxococcus xanthus, we discovered that more efficient predators accumulate mutations that activate a genetic program for predation. This program simultaneously triggers a metabolic shift favoring fatty acid degradation for energy production and upregulates antioxidant gene expression, enhancing protection against reactive oxygen species generated during prey cell lysis. This adaptive mechanism proves advantageous across a wide range of prey species, suggesting that metabolic adaptation plays a crucial role in the evolutionary trajectory of bacterial predators within their natural ecological niche.",10.1073/pnas.2420875122,biorxiv

However, there is still no objective consensus on how to evaluate their performance. In this study, we set out to validate generative networks for transcriptomics data generation by using statistical distances as robust evaluation metrics.

ResultsWe observe that statistical distances enable simultaneous evaluation of global and local data fidelity of generated synthetic data. Because these distances satisfy the properties of true metrics, they also enable formal hypothesis testing to assess whether generative models have in fact converged or are merely approaching the reference distribution. Crucially, optimizing for these distances was found to implicitly select models maximizing other widely used metrics of generative performance, providing evidence of their broad applicability.

The findings emphasize that orthologous interactions are complex and influenced by subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization of ecology and evolution. These findings enhance the existing understanding of the evolution of sleep-related genes and their association with metabolic and environmental changes, providing a foundation for subsequent experimental investigations and cross-taxonomic comparisons.",NA,biorxiv

Both NHPs and humans host a variety of herpesviruses. While these viruses typically cause asymptomatic infections in their natural hosts, they can lead to severe disease or even death when they move into novel hosts. In early 2024, deaths of Callithrix penicillata, the black-tufted marmoset, were reported in an urban park in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The epizootic was investigated in collaboration with CETAS/IBAMA and the Zoonoses Department of Belo Horizonte. Nine marmoset carcasses, and 4 sick marmosets were found in the park; the latter exhibited severe neurological symptoms and systemic illness before succumbing within 48 hours. Carcasses were tested for rabies virus and were all negative, and necropsy findings revealed widespread organ damage. In addition, the samples were tested for yellow fever virus, with negative results. Finally, molecular testing, viral isolation and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) as the causative agent. The likely source of infection was human-to-marmoset transmission, facilitated by close interactions such as feeding and handling.

To answer this question, we injected rabies virus into the intrinsic muscle that protracts the rat C3 vibrissa and used retrograde transneuronal transport to identify the cortical neurons that control the muscle. A surprisingly diverse set of cortical areas is the origin of disynaptic control over the motoneurons that influence the C3 protractor. More than two thirds of these layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PNs) are dispersed in frontal and parietal areas outside the primary motor cortex (vM1). This observation emphasizes the importance of descending commands from non-primary motor areas. More than a third of the L5PNs originate from somatosensory areas, such as the barrel field (vS1). The barrel field has been long considered a prototypic model system for studying sensory processing at the level of the cerebral cortex. Even so, we find that the number of L5PNs in vS1, and even their peak density, rivals the number and peak density of L5PNs in vM1. Thus, our results emphasize the importance of the barrel field in processing motor output. The distribution of L5PNs in vM1 and vS1 leads us to propose a new model of vibrissa protraction in which vM1 output results in protraction, and vS1 output results in reciprocal inhibition (suppression) of protraction. This paired initiation and suppression of complementary movements may be a general feature of the descending control signals from the rodent M1 and S1.",NA,biorxiv

We sampled noctuid moths in the canopy of a forest in Western Poland using flight-interception traps during two vegetative seasons. We calculated inter-annual variation for 31 species, and date of peak abundance and length of the flight season for 18 species. We found that for the 23 species for which we had phylogenetic information, larger moths and those with adult colour variation showed less inter-annual abundance variation, which corroborates results of previous studies. We found no indication that phenological traits are associated with the tested species traits. However, species that can feed on the dominant broad-leaved tree in which the traps were placed (Quercus petraea) tended to have a later date of peak abundance than other species. To draw more robust conclusions, future research should encompass a longer time span and a broader range of species.

However, in complex and dynamic environments, fast reactions are meaningful only when grounded in accurate judgments and correct choices, which often require cognitive control. Here, we investigate how threat intensity, reward value, and social hierarchy influence behavioral decisions in foraging mice exposed to overhead visual threats. We find that threat intensity plays a dominant role in decision-making: elevated threat levels trigger robust defensive responses, including shorter latencies to flee, increased fleeing speeds, and longer escape distances. The influence of reward is context-dependent: at low threat levels, higher reward values suppress defensive responses, leading to prolonged time in the reward zone, slower speeds, and shorter escape distances. In contrast, under high-threat conditions, increasing reward value enhances sensitivity to threats, as evidenced by shorter latencies to flee and heightened vigilance. Social hierarchy further shapes decision-making, with dominant mice exhibiting greater vigilance and a stronger preference for risk-averse behaviors compared to subordinates. To quantify the decision-making process, we developed a drift-diffusion leaky integrator model that successfully captures how mice integrate threat intensity, reward value, and vigilance into their behavioral decisions. Our findings reveal the economic and social modulation of survival decisions, offering insights into the computational mechanisms underlying the interplay between instinctive reaction and cognitive control in innate decision-making.",NA,biorxiv

However, monitoring data pose several challenges for statistical analysis, including spatial bias due to an unbalanced sampling of natural regions or habitats, variation in observer expertise, frequent observer changes, and overdispersion or zero-inflation in the raw data. An additional challenge arises from so-called  rolling survey designs, where each site is only visited once within each multi-year rotation cycle. We developed a GAMM-based workflow that addresses these challenges and exemplify its application with the highly structured data from the Ecological Area Sampling (EAS) in the German federal state North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). First, we derive a routine that allows informed decisions about the most appropriate combination of distribution family (Poisson or negative binomial), model covariates (e.g., habitat characteristics), and zero-inflation formulations to reflect species-specific data distributions. Second, we develop a correction factor that buffers population trend estimates for variation in observer expertise as reflected in variation in total bird abundance. Third, we integrate region-specific trends that adjust for between-year variation in the representation of habitat or natural regions within the yearly subset of sampled sites. In a consistency check, we found good match between our GAMM-based EAS trends and TRIM-based trends from the German Common Bird Monitoring scheme.

Notably, CaMKII inhibition at 30 min after onset of OGD prevented the impairment in CaMKII movement. Thus, CaMKII mediates both, LTP mechanisms and their ischemia-induced impairment.

We recently demonstrated that hindbrain [fourth ventricle (4V)] administration of oxytocin (OT) could be used as an adjunct to drugs that directly target beta-3 adrenergic receptors ({beta}3-AR) to elicit weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents. What remains unclear is whether systemic OT can be used as an adjunct with the {beta}3-AR agonist, CL 316243, to increase BAT thermogenesis and elicit weight loss in DIO rats. We hypothesized that systemic OT and {beta}3-AR agonist (CL 316243) treatment would produce an additive effect to reduce body weight and adiposity in DIO rats by decreasing food intake and stimulating BAT thermogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effects of systemic (subcutaneous) infusions of OT (50 nmol/day) or vehicle (VEH) when combined with daily systemic (intraperitoneal) injections of CL 316243 (0.5 mg/kg) or VEH on body weight, adiposity, food intake and brown adipose tissue temperature (TIBAT).

These effects were associated with decreased adiposity, energy intake and elevated TIBAT during the treatment period.

Leveraging deep learning and the Detectron2 framework, Dairy DigiD classifies cattle into four categories--young (<2 years), mature milking, pregnant, and old--using over 2,500 high-resolution facial images. A DenseNet121 model achieved a classification accuracy of 97%, showcasing its strong discriminative capability.

These RNAs are highly enriched for known TDP-43 binding sites, suggesting that TDP-43 directly binds them to regulate their localization. We then identified precise regions within RNAs that mediate their TDP-43-dependent localization and interaction with TDP-43 using high-throughput functional assays in cells and high-throughput binding assays in vitro. We found that these regions also mediated TDP-43-dependent RNA instability, identifying the mechanism by which TDP-43 regulates RNA localization. ALS-associated mutations in TDP-43 resulted in similar RNA mislocalization phenotypes as did TDP-43 loss in human iPS-derived motor neurons.

Here we explored the role of natural and synthetic coumarin compounds in signal interference and control of pathogenesis in bacterial and fungal pathogens, uncovering an important  hydroxylation-motif in the specific inhibition of two Pseudomonas aeruginosa interspecies and interkingdom communication molecules. Characterisation of the anti-biofilm activity of coumarins revealed changes in exopolysaccharide production independent of the initial attachment phenotype. Molecular modelling provides an insight into the receptor binding dynamics of three closely related natural coumarins, suggesting an intricate and highly specific host-microbe interaction at the species level. As the very real threat of antimicrobial resistance continues to shadow our horizons, phytochemicals such as coumarins have potential to deliver an ecological solution to dysbiosis in the host-microbe interaction.

ImportanceNatural ecosystems rely on homeostatic interactions between the kingdoms of life to ensure sustainable and balanced communities can persist. Plant-derived coumarins have recently emerged as playing an important role in shaping microbial communities, presenting a remarkable chemical diversity that can influence the behaviour of bacteria and fungi. At the same time, one of the major challenges to human health continues to be the spread of antimicrobial resistance and the parallel absence of a concerted effort to source and produce new antibiotics at industrial scale. Therefore, new approaches to the control of infection are required, and an ecosystem-level lens may offer one such innovative intervention. Coumarins have the potential to neutralise the very mechanisms used by bacteria and fungi to cause infection leading to morbidity and mortality in hosts ranging from plant to animals. Here we present a mechanistic insight into how effective these molecules can be in targeting keystone pathogens termed the ESKAPEEs and their fungal counterparts.",NA,biorxiv

Therefore, we investigated the longitudinal effect of subtherapeutic and therapeutic doses of bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD) on antibiotic resistance genes, mobile genetic elements, and metabolism genes by analyzing the turkey cecal metagenome. The therapeutic dose of BMD increased a vast array of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), conjugation-related genes of type IV secretion system and transduction-related genes for the length of the experiment (78 days), while a smaller, transient effect was observed due to the subtherapeutic dose. Estimated bacterial growth rate, estimated by metagenome assembled genome sequence coverage, decreased after 7 days of in-feed BMD, but increased in the therapeutic group over time. Tryptophan synthesis from chorismate increased in a dose-dependent manner between days 7 - 35. Overall, the effects of subtherapeutic BMD on the turkey cecal microbiota was temporary while those of a therapeutic dose were longer lasting. This study shows that antimicrobial resistance genes belonging to multiple antibiotic classes, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were increased after BMD administration. The enrichment these genes by BMD shows the risk associated with antimicrobial feed additives. BMDs effect on tryptophan synthesis provides a potential metabolic target for developing non-antibiotic microbiome modulatory growth promoters for turkey production.

ImportanceAntibiotic use in agricultural animals remains a hotly debated and important topic to human, animal, and environmental health. The dose-dependent responses to BMD, an antibiotic fed additive allowed at both therapeutic and subtherapeutic doses, are not well understood. This study highlights that therapeutic use of BMD is a stronger selective pressure than the subtherapeutic dose for antibiotic resistance genes and genes related to horizontal gene transfer. This indicates that use of BMD could select for antibiotic resistant bacteria that may pose a risk to animal, human and environmental health. Additionally, this study highlighted that BMD decreased the activity of beneficially bacteria, and therefore may be associated with a decreased concentration of bacterial metabolites (especially tryptophan related) in the cecum. This may indicate that growth promoting antibiotics suppress bacterial activity generally, rather than allowing beneficial bacteria to generate beneficial metabolites.",NA,biorxiv

Using apple scar skin viroid (ASSVd) and cucumber as a host, we demonstrate that viroid RNAs in circular, linear, and small RNA forms are present in cucumber EVs. ASSVd RNA exhibits features of extracellular RNAs, such as m6A methylation and five EXOmotifs.

RNA co-immunoprecipitation and immuno-enrichment assays reveal that CsPP2 and ASSVd co-localize in CsTET8-positive EVs, with direct interactions between CsPP2-CsTET8 and CsPP2-ASSVd. We propose CsPP2 functions as an RNA-sorting protein that mediates RNA loading into EVs. Further, we show that whiteflies can acquire ASSVd via EVs and transmit it to healthy plants, indicating a cross-kingdom transmission route.

Participants formed memories for naturalistic events following a manipulation of their sense of embodiment from in-body and out-of-body perspectives and recalled them during functional scanning. Region of interest multivariate analyses examined how the angular gyrus, precuneus, and hippocampus reflected visual perspective, embodiment, and their interaction during remembering. Patterns of activity during retrieval in the left angular gyrus and bilateral precuneus predicted the combination of embodiment and visual perspective, and embodiment on its own separated from visual perspective. Decoding accuracy was not significant for any region when predicting visual perspective alone. Our results suggest that the contribution of posterior parietal regions in establishing visual perspectives within memories cannot be disentangled from embodiment.

ARMMs packaged multiple payloads per vesicle in our production system, yielding dose-dependent functional delivery of Cre or Cas9/gRNA RNP to a variety of cell types, including primary mouse and human cells. Oropharyngeal aspiration of ARMMs loaded with Cre led to biodistribution to alveolar macrophages (AMs), whereas intravenous administration predominantly to Kupffer cells (KCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and splenocytes.

Despite being the second most common inherited bleeding disorder, the pathophysiological mechanism underlying HHT-associated hemorrhage is poorly understood. HHT pathogenesis is thought to follow a Knudsonian two-hit model, requiring a second somatic mutation for lesion formation. Mutations in activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) gene cause HHT type 2. We hypothesize that somatic mutation of Alk1 in arterial endothelial cells (AECs) leads to arterial defects and hemorrhage. Here, we mutated Alk1 in AECs in postnatal mice using Bmx(PAC)-CreERT2 and found that somatic arterial endothelial mutation of Alk1 was sufficient to induce spontaneous epistaxis and multifocal cerebral microhemorrhage. This bleeding occurred in the presence of tortuous and enlarged blood vessels, loss of arterial molecular marker Efnb2, disorganization of vascular smooth muscle, and impaired vasoregulation. Our data suggest that arterial endothelial deletion of Alk1 leading to reduced arterial identity and disrupted vascular smooth muscle cell coverage is a plausible molecular mechanism for HHT-associated severe epistaxis. This work provides the first evidence that somatic Alk1 mutation in AECs can cause hemorrhagic vascular lesions, offering a novel preclinical model critically needed for studying HHT-associated epistaxis, and delineating an arterial mechanism to HHT pathophysiology.",NA,biorxiv

There is a general consensus that simple models of quantitative genetic variation, which are mostly founded on the assumption of mutation-selection balance in a constant environment, have failed to explain high heritability. To make matters worse, the reasons for failure are unknown, leaving little to guide future model developments. Here we revisit this puzzle by taking the canonical Latter-Bulmer model and relaxing the assumption of perfect environmental stasis. Instead we assume that the trait optimum changes slowly but steadily in a random walk (specifically, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process), similar to standard models used for phylogenetic comparative methods. We show that our model behaves qualitatively differently to its stationary optimum counterpart even though the optimum only changes slowly. This is the result of a feedback between the adaptation rate and selection coefficient fluctuations. The heritability predictions resulting from this feedback are more consistent with observations and also less sensitive to evolutionary parameters than the classical LB model. We derive a simple formula to predict genetic variation under random walk optimum fluctuations which helps to explain some of our counter-intuitive results and which should be useful for understanding the potential influence of fluctuations in future work. Since the feedback driving our results should also occur in more complex models e.g. with multiple traits, we argue that environmental change has been an essential biological ingredient missing in previous mutation-selection balance models of quantitative trait heritability.",NA,biorxiv

We developed a model predicting that faster-developing populations exhibit greater heterogeneity during development but reduced heterogeneity at maturity, while slower-growing populations show the opposite pattern. Experiments in Arabidopsis elf3 and barley Hvelf3 mutants supported this prediction. In Arabidopsis, ELF3 controlled hypocotyl elongation variability via maturation rate rather than direct regulation. Bolting time heterogeneity also decreased in faster-growing plants. In barley, Hvelf3 altered growth heterogeneity, but this was initially masked by germination timing differences. Finally, smaller barley plants were found to be more resilient to osmotic stress, suggesting that ELF3-driven trait heterogeneity may contribute to bet hedging.

This is simulated using generative pre-trained transformers, a variety of large language model. As well as capturing the gist of specific episodes, the neocortical network extracts statistical patterns that generalise to new situations. This model explains human performance on statistical learning and structural inference tasks, and accounts for gist or schema-based distortions in memories of narratives. It also shows how recent memory can contribute to inference and planning, with specific memories retrieved from the hippocampus providing the context in working memory for prediction using the  general knowledge of the neocortical network; we model this hippocampal and neocortical interaction as  retrieval-augmented generation.

Understanding this relationship requires a metric to quantify how neuronal properties contribute to the functional complexity of single neurons, yet no such standardized measure currently exists. Here, we propose the Functional Complexity Index (FCI), a generalized, deep learning-based framework to assess the input-output complexity of neurons. By comparing the FCI of cortical pyramidal neurons from different layers in rats and humans, we identified key morpho-electrical factors that underlie functional complexity. Human cortical pyramidal neurons were found to be significantly more functionally complex than their rat counterparts, primarily due to differences in dendritic membrane area and branching pattern, as well as density and nonlinearity of NMDA-mediated synaptic receptors.

The provirus-encoded system lacks the adaptation genes (cas1, cas2, and cas4), suggesting its potential reliance on the plasmid-encoded CRISPR-Cas module for the acquisition of new spacers. This arrangement suggests a potential instance of ""adaptive outsourcing,"" where a provirus might leverage a co-resident MGE for a key function. Through comparative genomics, we show that similar proviral CRISPR-Cas systems are found in distantly related haloarchaea (e.g., Natrinema and Halobacterium), indicating probable virus-mediated horizontal transfer and suggesting they may function as mobile defense modules. Phylogenetic analysis highlights distinct evolutionary origins of the two systems: the plasmid system clusters with other Haloferax CRISPR-Cas systems, while the proviral system clusters with those from other genera, consistent with horizontal acquisition. Interestingly, spacer analysis reveals that the proviral systems predominantly target viral sequences, while the plasmid system appears to target both plasmids and viral sequences, a distribution mirroring broader trends observed in other plasmid- and chromosome-encoded CRISPR systems.

While amino acid concentrations in nectar are typically low (<1 mM), pollen contains higher levels (10-200 mM), with the exact concentrations varying by plant species. Behavioural studies suggest bumblebees have preferences for specific amino acids, yet whether such preferences are mediated pre-ingestively via gustatory mechanisms remains unclear. This study explores bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) gustatory sensitivity to two essential amino acids (EAAs), valine and lysine, using electrophysiological recordings from gustatory sensilla on their mouthparts. Valine elicited a concentration-dependent response, with spikes produced from 0.1 mM and reaching an asymptote at 5 mM, indicating that bumblebees could perceive valine at the concentrations found naturally in nectar and pollen. In contrast, lysine failed to evoke spiking responses across tested concentrations (0.1-500 mM). The absence of lysine detection raises questions about the specificity and diversity of amino acid-sensitive receptors in bumblebees. Bees responded to valine at lower concentrations than sucrose, suggesting comparatively higher sensitivity to amino acids (EC50: 0.7 mM vs. 3.91 mM for sucrose). Our findings indicate that bumblebees are able to rapidly evaluate the amino acid content of pollen and nectar while foraging from flowers using pre-ingestive cues, rather than relying on post-ingestive cues or feedback from their nestmates. Such sensory capabilities likely impact foraging strategies, with implications for plant-bee interactions and pollination.

LBVD is caused by two unrelated negative-stranded RNA viruses, that is, Mirafiori lettuce big-vein virus (MiLBVV) and Lettuce big-vein associated virus (LBVaV) both vectored by the soilborne fungus Olpidium virulentus. Despite extensive research, a synergistic effect between the two viruses has not been observed, while both viruses individually have been suggested to be the causal agent for the disease. By performing lettuce reinfections using a large soil sample collection carrying LBVD infested O. virulentus spores, the presence of LBVaV was consistently established in diseased lettuce heads, while MiLBVV infections were apparently less prevalent. Yet, aboveground infections with MiLBVV corresponded with strong disease symptoms. Strikingly, the spread of LBVaV from the root to shoot always preceded that of MiLBVV. The LBVaV systemic spread was highly synchronized between plants, while MiLBVV spread was always delayed and asynchronous. A pan-genome analysis revealed independent segment reassortments for both viruses indicative of mixed field infections over the sampled period. Yet, RNA segment abundance was highly conserved for both viruses between all re-infections, suggesting that segment abundance has a regulatory role for the two individual viruses, but that segment abundance is not impacted by the presence of the other two viruses. The pan-genome analysis also revealed different evolutionary rates of the viral ORFs suggesting that mutagenesis of certain ORFs compromises viral fitness and thus revealing a potential weak spot for both viruses.

We show unequivocally that MiLBVV is the main virus responsible for severe disease symptoms in lettuce heads. Yet, MiLBVV root-to-shoot movement was in our conditions always preceded by LBVaV movement into the lettuce heads. Arguably, LBVaV thus facilitates the root-to-shoot movement of MiLBVV. Moreover, both viruses undergo segment reassortment increasing their genome plasticity and the reassortment events appeared to be independent events with mixed infections. Finally, we provide data that both viruses regulate gene expression via the copy number of their RNA segments, but that the genome formula does not change in dual infections. We thus provide evidence for a synergistic interaction needed for strong LBVD symptoms.",NA,biorxiv

We target anterior (transmodal-dominant) and posterior (unimodal-dominant) thalamic regions, further divided into ventral and dorsal regions, while participants perform a near-threshold visual perception task. Task performance is evaluated using Signal Detection Theory metrics. We find that the high duty cycle stimulation of the ventral anterior thalamus enhanced object recognition sensitivity. We also observe a general (i.e., region-independent) effect of LIFU on decision bias (i.e., a tendency toward a particular response) and object categorization accuracy. Specifically, high duty cycle stimulation decreases categorization accuracy, whereas low duty cycle shifts decision bias towards a more conservative stance. In conclusion, our results provide causal insight into the functional organization of the thalamus in shaping human visual experience and highlight the unique role of the transmodal-dominant ventral anterior thalamus.",NA,biorxiv

We have developed and optimised novel methods for whole blood analysis using volumetric absorptive microsampling devices to produce over 3000 protein identifications by LCMS on a Q Exactive HF-X Orbitrap. These methods were tested using a set of whole blood samples from lung cancer patients and matching healthy controls finding 455 differentially expressed proteins, using a mid-throughput method enabling analysis of 18 samples per day. To increase throughput for larger clinical cohorts, a 60-sample per day method was tested on a Sciex ZenoTOF 7600. The high-throughput method produced 1.5-fold fewer protein identifications and a higher overall % CV compared to the mid-throughput method. Despite the lower numbers, it produced a set of 36 disease-relevant and discriminatory differentially expressed proteins that, using a machine learning model, could differentiate between the disease and control samples with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 88.9% using random forest algorithms. These data support the use of high-throughput mass spectrometry methods to screen large cohorts for diagnostic biomarkers that can then be followed up with more targeted analyses.",NA,biorxiv

The phylum Nucleocytoviricota encompasses diverse and ubiquitous viruses, including Poxviridae, the climate-modulating Emiliania huxleyi virus and other so-called Giant Viruses. Cytoplasmic members of this phylum form viral factories but their nature has remained unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that these viral factories are formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. We prove that mimivirus viral factories are formed by multilayered phase separation, orchestrated by at least two scaffold proteins. To extend these findings across the phylum Nucleocytoviricota, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline to predict scaffold proteins based on a conserved molecular grammar, despite major primary sequence variability. Scaffold candidates were validated in Marseilleviridae and Poxviridae, highlighting a role of H5 as a scaffold protein in the vaccinia virus. Finally, we provide a repertoire of client proteins of the nucleus-like viral factory of mimivirus and demonstrate important sub-compartmentalization of functions, including those related to the central dogma. Overall, we reveal a new mechanism for an organelle to deploy nuclear-like functions entirely based on phase separation and re-classified phylum Nucleocytoviricota viral factories as biomolecular condensates.",NA,biorxiv

However, the pulvinar has a large tissue volume, multiple subnuclei, and widespread cortical connections. It remains unknown whether electrical stimulation of distinct pulvinar subregions affects the temporal, occipital, and parietal areas differently. To address this gap, we delivered single-pulse electrical stimulation to the pulvinar and measured the resulting brain stimulation evoked potentials in twelve patients undergoing stereotactic EEG for drug-resistant epilepsy. Brain stimulation evoked potentials were parameterized across the occipital, temporal and parietal cortex. Stimulation of the lateral pulvinar elicited significant brain stimulation evoked potentials in striate and extrastriate areas that diminish as stimulation shifts towards the medial pulvinar. Conversely, stimulation of the ventral aspect of the medial pulvinar produced significant lateral temporal evoked potentials, which diminish with lateral pulvinar stimulation. We also found that stimulation of the dorsomedial pulvinar evoked significant parietal responses with limited striate/extrastriate and lateral temporal responses. These results demonstrate that electrical stimulation of specific pulvinar subregions influences distinct occipital, parietal and lateral temporal areas. Selective targeting of pulvinar subregions to maximize seizure network engagement may be essential for individualized treatment of posterior quadrant and temporal epilepsies.",NA,biorxiv

We previously showed that EH domain-containing protein Irs4p binds 5-phosphatase enzyme Inp51p to regulate plasma membrane levels of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in C. albicans. Indeed, deletion of IRS4 or INP51 led to elevated levels of PI(4,5)P2 and presence of abnormal intracellular membranous PI(4,5)P2 patches. We demonstrated an interplay between PI(4,5)P2 and septins to regulate the PKC-Mkc1 cell wall integrity pathway, echinocandin and cell wall stress responses, and virulence during candidiasis. In the current investigation, we used fluorescent protein tagging and live cell imaging to follow the nascency of PI(4,5)P2 patches We show that these abnormal patches tightly correlate with cytokinesis, as they predominantly arise close to the site and time of cell division. We further demonstrate these patches colocalize PI(4,5)P2 with actomyosin ring components Act1p and Myo1p, which form its core, and active Rho1p, a small GTPase that plays a regulatory role. Additionally, activation of Rho1p was altered in irs4 and inp51 mutants compared to wild-type strain, with over-activation or down-activation during early exponential or stationary phase, respectively. Wild-type cells exposed to 4xMIC of the echinocandin caspofungin show abnormal PI(4,5)P2 patches colocalizing the same cytokinesis components as above, except that they were transient.

However, the mechanism by which rRNA methylation alters drug binding, particularly at the distant but functionally more important site in 23S rRNA Helix 69 (H69), is currently unknown. We determined high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Mycolicibacterium smegmatis 70S ribosome with or without the two ribose 2-O-methyl modifications incorporated by TlyA. In the unmodified ribosome, the tip of H69 adopts a more compact conformation, positioning two key nucleotides (A2137 and C2138) such that interactions with capreomycin would be lost and the binding pocket partially occluded. In contrast, methylation of 23S rRNA nucleotide C2144 results in conformational changes that propagate from the site of modification to the H69 tip, resulting in its movement away from h44, a more favorable positioning of C2138 and adoption of a more open conformation to enable capreomycin binding. Methylation of h44 also results in structural rearrangements at the H69-h44 interface that further support antibiotic binding. These structures thus reveal the effect and regulation of distant rRNA methylation on ribosome-targeting antibiotic binding.",NA,biorxiv

While ubiquitous in environmental reservoirs such as soil, water, and biofilms, the genetic factors that enable certain strains to invade and persist in human hosts have remained elusive. To address this gap, we compared whole-genome sequences from 45 environmental isolates-- primarily collected on Hawaii Island--with a globally sourced set of clinical isolates retrieved from NCBI RefSeq. Our phylogenetic reconstruction delineated environmental and clinical lineages, and pangenome profiling revealed a conserved core genome of approximately 4,800 genes alongside a large accessory genome. Crucially, we found 20 genes conserved in clinical isolates, but not environmental isolates. Clinical isolates were found to have conserved genes coding for erm(41), three transcriptional regulators, a pilus synthesis gene, an NADP-dependent oxidoreductase, a carbonic anhydrase, a probable L-ectoine synthase, a ribonuclease P protein component, and 11 hypothetical genes, whereas environmental isolated did not conserve any of these genes. This indicates that clinical isolates have undergone broad changes relating to metabolism, pilus biosynthesis, and transcriptional regulators, which may be necessary for pathogenicity. The candidate virulence markers uncovered here lay the groundwork for experimental validation, rapid diagnostics for non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and targeted surveillance of environmental reservoirs to mitigate the emergence of clinically significant strains.

ImportanceMycobacterium abscessus is an emerging pathogen that causes pulmonary infections in susceptible individuals. Though currently an opportunistic pathogen, M. abscessus may be undergoing evolutionary changes to become an obligate pathogen. Because of this, there is the need to identify markers of virulence in M. abscessus in order to better screen isolates and assess their risk of causing infection. This also provides the opportunity to study a similar pathogenesis to what Mycobacterium tuberculosis may have undergone. This study revealed that clinical isolates of M. abscessus have conserved genes relating to pilus biosynthesis, metabolism, and transcriptional regulators that environmental isolates do not have. These conserved genes may be required for M. abscessus to acquire virulence, and these genes have potential use as biomarkers to screen isolates for possible pathogenicity.",NA,biorxiv

These plants acquire water and nutrients from their hosts through a specialized organ called the haustorium. A key step in haustorium development involves cell wall modification. In this study, we identified and analyzed the evolutionary relationships of pectate lyase-like (PLL) genes across parasitic plants and other non-parasitic land plant lineages. To support detailed examination of gene models and paralogous gene family members, we used published parasitic plant genomes, as well as a recently generated draft genome assembly and annotation of Triphysaria versicolor. One particular PLL gene, denoted as PLL1 in parasitic Orobanchaceae, emerged as an important candidate gene for parasitism, as highlighted by our previous comparative transcriptomics research; it belongs to the largest sub-clade of the PLL gene family and is highly upregulated in haustoria. To explore its function in haustorium development, we manipulated PLL1 expression in T. versicolor, a model parasitic species from Orobanchaceae, using direct transformation of the parasite and host-induced-gene-silencing (HIGS). For HIGS, we generated transgenic Medicago truncatula and Arabidopsis thaliana hosts expressing hairpin RNAs targeting the PLL gene in T. versicolor. Both experimental approaches effectively reduced the PLL1 expression in the haustorium of T. versicolor, resulting in an increased frequency of poorly adhered parasites. These findings demonstrate that PLL1 plays a crucial role in haustorium development and suggest it as a promising target for managing parasitic weeds.

Simulations confirm that we are able to retrieve the shape of the relationship given certain assumptions about the nature of the relationship between the traits. We applied the method to the genetic relationship between BMI, sleep duration, and height, and psychiatric disorders (ADHD, anorexia nervosa, and depression) using data from approximately 450K individuals from UK Biobank.

We observed similar findings for the genetic relationship between BMI and anorexia, sleep duration and depression, and sleep duration and ADHD. We observed no underlying nonlinearity in the genetic relationship between height and psychiatric traits.

Using a novel statistical approach, we show that nonlinear genetic relationships between traits are detectable and genetic associations as quantified using global estimators like genetic correlations are not informative about underlying complexities in these relationships.

The expression and function of CNTFR and PODXL on chondrogenic cells were validated using western blotting, immunocytochemistry and transient gene silencing. Notably, silencing of CNTFR and PODXL revealed divergent transcriptional effects on COL1A1, a key marker of fibrocartilage and matrix quality, indicating opposing roles in regulating extracellular matrix composition and chondrocyte identity. The identification of PODXL and CNTFR provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying chondrogenesis. The expression of CNTFR on chondrogenic cells suggests a potential role for neurotrophic factors in chondrogenesis and cartilage repair strategies. PODXL, a sialomucin linked to cell-matrix interactions and migration, is potentially involved in maintaining early chondrocyte phenotypes and mediating chondrogenic signals.

To overcome these challenges, we apply label-free, contact-free holographic video microscopy to study the behavior of a condensate-forming protein in vitro. This technique enables rapid, high-throughput, and precise measurements of individual condensate diameters and refractive indexes, providing unprecedented insight into size distributions and dense-phase macromolecular concentrations over time.

The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of measuring motivation through brain recording methods during physical activity, with a specific focus on cycling. The experiment employed the Effort Expenditure for Reward Task (EEfRT), a decision-making task based on effort and reward, conducted under two conditions: one involving cycling on an ergometer at moderate intensity and the other without cycling. The P300, an event-related potential linked to motivation, was recorded using electroencephalography.

A total of 20 participants were recruited to complete the EEfRT, which involved making effort-based decisions of increasing difficulty in order to receive varying levels of monetary reward. The results demonstrated that the P300 amplitude was influenced by the act of cycling, exhibiting a reduction during the cycling session. This reduction may be explained by a reallocation of cognitive resources due to the exertion of physical effort, which is consistent with the transient hypofrontality theory. In terms of behaviour, participants demonstrated a tendency to make more challenging choices when the potential rewards were higher or the probability of gaining them was lower. This pattern was observed in both the cycling and non-cycling conditions. A positive correlation was identified between P300 amplitude and the proportion of difficult choices, particularly under conditions of low reward probability. This suggests that P300 may serve as a neural marker of motivation.

The study demonstrates the feasibility of using electroencephalography to monitor motivation during exercise in real-time, with potential applications in rehabilitation settings. However, further research is required to refine the design and explore the effects of different exercise types on motivation.",NA,biorxiv

However, experimental induction of such expansions remains challenging. Here we introduce a method termed break-induced replication (BIR)-mediated tandem repeat expansion (BITREx) to address this challenge. BITREx strategically places Cas9 nickase adjacent to a tandem gene array to break the replication fork that has replicated the array, forming a single-end double-strand break. This break is subsequently end-resected to become single-stranded. Since there is no repeat unit downstream of the break, the single-stranded DNA often invades an upstream unit to initiate ectopic BIR, resulting in array expansion. BITREx has successfully expanded gene arrays in budding yeast, with the CUP1 array reaching [~]1 Mb. Furthermore, appropriate splint DNA allows BITREx to generate tandem arrays de novo from single-copy genes. We have also demonstrated BITREx in mammalian cells. Therefore, BITREx will find various unique applications in genome engineering.",NA,biorxiv

Applying this pipeline to 12 diverse natural peptides and synthetic peptidomimetics uncovers shared antimicrobial activities, but with different kinetics, forming two classes. With class I peptides, growth arrest is abrupt and predominantly coupled with inner membrane permeabilization and ribosome/DNA reorganization. However, membrane permeabilization leads to rapid peptide absorption by the first exposed bacterial cells, resulting in low efficacy against dense populations. With class II peptides, ribosome/DNA reorganization and growth inhibition occur more gradually, as inner membrane permeabilization is either absent or delayed. This is offset by slower intracellular peptide uptake and greater efficacy against high cell densities.

They feed on various microorganisms and can play an important role in the food web and its dynamics. We previously described that FLAs belonging to the Vannella genus from the oyster farming area of the Thau lagoon in France could establish stable interactions with Vibrionaceae and could play a role in the selection of some virulence factors, potentially influencing pathogen dynamics. To further investigate the ecological interactions between FLA populations and Vibrionaceae in Mediterranean coastal waters, we conducted monthly sampling for one year at three contrasting sites. Free-living amoebae populations were isolated by culturing water and sediment samples on different bacterial lawns, including E. coli or V. tasmaniensis, V. crassostreae and V. harveyi. Amoebozoan diversity was analyzed using v4-18S barcoding and revealed distinct communities between the sediment and the water column, with Vannellidae significantly enriched in the water column whereas Paramoebidae were significantly enriched in the sediments. Selection of grazers on different bacterial lawns revealed that V. tasmaniensis inhibited the growth of most Vannellidae, whereas V. crassostreae inhibited the growth of a large proportion of Paramoebidae. These differences were further confirmed in functional grazing assays using isolates belonging to each Amoebozoa taxonomic group.

They are involved in a wide range of biological roles because of their exceptionally unique and distinct structural characteristics. After the completion of the human genome sequencing project, a lot of bio-informatics algorithms were introduced to predict the active G4s regions in vitro based on the canonical G4 sequence elements, G-richness, and G-skewness, as well as the non-canonical sequence features. Recently, sequencing techniques like G4-seq and G4-ChIP-seq were developed to map the G4s in vitro, and in vivo respectively at a few hundred base resolution. Subsequently, several machine learning and deep learning approaches were developed for predicting the G4 regions using the existing databases. However, their prediction models were simplistic, and the prediction accuracy was notably poor. In response, here, we propose a novel convolutional neural network with Bi-LSTM and attention layers, named G4-Attention, to predict the G4 forming sequences with improved accuracy. G4-Attention achieves high accuracy and attains state-of-the-art results in the G4 propensity and mismatch score prediction task in comparison to other available benchmark models in the literature. Besides the balanced dataset, the developed model can predict the G4 regions accurately in the highly class-imbalanced datasets. Furthermore, the model achieves a significant improvement in the cell-type-specific G4 prediction task. In addition, G4-Attention trained on the human genome dataset can be applied to any non-human genomic DNA sequences to predict the G4 formation propensities accurately. We have also added interpretability analysis of our model to gain further insights.

Author summaryG-quadruplex, a non-canonical secondary nucleic acid structure, has emerged as a potential pharmacological target because of its significant implication in several human diseases including cancer, aging, neurological disorders, etc. Despite numerous computational algorithm developments, the prediction of G4 regions accurately in different organisms including humans still remains a challenging task. To address this, in this work, we have presented a novel advanced deep learning architecture called G4-Attention for predicting DNA G-quadruplexes in different organisms including humans. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate Bi-LSTM and attention layers on top of a CNN architecture in a deep learning model (G4-Attention) for predicting G4-forming sequences. Our developed model outperforms existing algorithms and achieves current state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in G4 propensity and mismatch score prediction tasks. In addition, the developed model achieves superior results across non-human genomes, class-imbalanced datasets, and cell line-specific datasets.

The genome of circulating SBV, i.e. variants present in viraemic ruminants or insect vectors, is very stable, while variants found in malformed ruminant foetuses display a high genetic variability. It was suggested that foetal infection provides an environment that favours viral mutations that enable immune escape in the unborn, but at the costs of limiting the ability of the virus to spread further. To investigate infection and dissemination rates of different SBV variants in the insect vectors, we fed laboratory-reared Culicoides sonorensis with blood containing the prototype strain BH80/11-4 from a viraemic cow or strain D281/12, which was isolated from the brain of a sheep foetus and harbours multiple mutations in all three genome segments. Further, virus variants lacking NSs, NSm or both non-structural proteins were included. Six days after feeding, virus replication was found in about 2% of the midges exposed to wild-type strain BH80/11-4. The absence of the non-structural proteins had no obvious effect on the oral susceptibility to virus infection, as 2.78% of the midges fed with the NSs-deletion mutant displayed after six days viral loads higher than the respective day-0-group, 1.92% of the midges exposed to the NSm-deletion mutant and 1.55% of midges exposed to the NSs/NSm-deletion mutant. In contrast, strain D281/12 did not replicate at all in the midges, supporting the assumption that SBV variants arising in infected foetuses are unable to enter the normal insect-mammalian host cycle.

ImportanceBiting midges are responsible for the transmission of Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a pathogen of veterinary importance that primarily infects ruminants. Although SBV has been extensively studied in the mammalian host, the virus-intrinsic factors allowing infection of, and replication in, biting midges are largely unknown. Therefore, we infected laboratory-reared Culicoides sonorensis midges with SBV variants by feeding them with virus-containing blood. The SBV variants differed in their genome composition, as we used the prototype wild-type strain, a strain with multiple mutations that was isolated from the brain of a malformed foetus, and recombinants lacking either NSs or NSm or both of these non-structural proteins. While the non-structural proteins had no obvious effect, the variant from the malformed foetus did not replicate at all, indicating that virus variants with characteristic genomic mutations present in foetuses lose their ability to infect the insect vector and will be excluded from the natural transmission cycle.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we sought to eliminate pathogenic {beta}-catenin from the cytosol using designer ubiquibodies (uAbs), chimeric proteins composed of an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a target-binding domain that redirect intracellular proteins to the proteasome for degradation. To accelerate uAb development, we leveraged a protein language model (pLM)-driven algorithm called SaLT&PepPr to computationally design ""guide"" peptides with affinity for {beta}-catenin, which were subsequently fused to the catalytic domain of a human E3 called C-terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP). Expression of the resulting peptide-guided uAbs in colorectal cancer cells led to the identification of several designs that significantly reduced the abnormally stable pool of free {beta}-catenin in the cytosol and nucleus while preserving the normal membrane-associated subpopulation. This selective knockdown of pathogenic {beta}-catenin suppressed Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling and impaired tumor cell survival and proliferation. Furthermore, one of the best degraders selectively decreased cytosolic but not membrane-associated {beta}-catenin levels in livers of BALB/c mice following delivery as a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA.

Activity-dependent plasticity mechanisms, such as Hebbian learning, regulate these building blocks, promoting synaptic growth to encode acquired knowledge. However, this process can destabilize cortical networks through overexcitation, leading to runaway dynamics. To prevent such instabilities the brain uses compensatory mechanisms like synaptic scaling. Existing models rely on rapid timescales, contradicting experimental observations that synaptic scaling occurs slowly. Here, we introduce aggregate scaling, a simple framework to study synapse-mediated homeostasis based on the availability and competitive redistribution of synaptic building blocks. Our model enforces stability by integrating rapid regulation of the total synaptic strength and firing rate homeostasis over much slower, realistic timescales. It preserves key neuronal properties, such as firing activity around a homeostatic set-point, long-tailed distributions of synaptic weights, and response to brief stimulation.

Author summaryLearning and memory rely on changes in the strength of synapses, connections between neurons. When these changes go unchecked, they can lead to abnormal brain activity. Homeostatic mechanisms such as synaptic scaling seem to contribute to the brains solution to this problem. However, most existing models of synaptic scaling require this process to be much faster than what is observed in real neurons, raising doubts about their biological accuracy. In our study, we present aggregate scaling, an alternative framework where synapses share and compete for limited molecular resources needed to maintain their strength. This competition is paired with a homeostatic regulation of the abundance of synaptic rescources. We show that this allows neurons and networks to remain stable while still supporting learning. Unlike previous models, our approach operates on biologically realistic timescales and reproduces key experimental findings, including stable neural activity and natural patterns of synaptic strength. Overall our model provides insights into how the brain maintains balance during learning, emphasizing the importance of synaptic resource logistics.",NA,biorxiv

Most of these delicate structures must survive for an organism's lifetime, meaning up to a century in humans. Long-term maintenance and sustained functionality of axons requires motor protein-driven transport distributing life-sustaining materials and organelles to places of need. It seems therefore plausible that loss of motor function can cause axon degeneration; however, also gain-of-function conditions were linked to disorders including motor neuron disease or spastic paraplegia. To understand this phenomenon, we studied ~40 genetic manipulations of motor proteins, cargo linkers and regulators of reactive oxygen species in one standardised Drosophila primary neuron system. Using axonal microtubule bundle organisation as a relevant readout reflecting the state of axon integrity, we found that losses of Dynein heavy chain, KIF1A/Unc-104 and KIF5/Kinesin heavy chain (Khc) all cause bundle disintegration in the form of chaotically curled microtubules. Detailed functional studies of Khc and its adaptor proteins revealed that losses of mitochondrial or lysosomal transport cause ROS dyshomeostasis, which is a condition that inducing MT-curling in fly and mouse neurons alike. We find that hyper-activated Khc induces the same MT-curling phenotype, not through ROS but directly through enhanced mechanical forces. Studies with loss of Unc-104 and expression of an ALS-linked mutant form of the human Khc orthologue KIF5A suggest that the two mechanisms apply to motors beyond Khc.

Methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) typically plays a role in elongation and the initiation of protein synthesis. Molecular recognition of the CAU anticodon of tRNA by MetRS in the two processes is a crucial step. Until now, no known experimental structures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) show this binding. We therefore modeled the Mtb MetRS complexes with initiator and elongator tRNAs to find their differential binding mechanism during molecular dynamics simulations of 6 {micro}s. We found that the elongator tRNA binding was stable with the protein, while the initiator tRNA binds transiently, with major intra-tRNA interactions maintained in both. This could be due to fast initiator tRNA charging in contrast to the elongator tRNA, which could take more time to charge. tRNA interacts with the MetRS active site and anticodon domain. The electrostatic attractions between tRNA and the proteins catalytic domain possibly caused its charging with methionine. The repulsive and attractive forces between tRNA and the proteins connective peptide domain and KMSKS loop triggered the opening of the binding pocket, causing the reaction and the product release. At the same time, tRNAs strong binding to the proteins anticodon domain facilitated this reaction. These events show the possible pathway of tRNA charging. tRNA formed salt-bridges with the positively charged Arg and Lys, whereas the negatively charged Asp and Glu caused repulsive binding.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargo can serve as biomarkers of beta cell health and contribute to islet intercellular communication. We hypothesized that the inflammatory milieu of type 1 diabetes increases PD-L1 in beta cell EV cargo and that EV PD-L1 may protect beta cells against immune-mediated cell death.

MethodsBeta cell lines and human islets were treated with proinflammatory cytokines to model the proinflammatory type 1 diabetes microenvironment. EVs were isolated using ultracentrifugation or size exclusion chromatography and analysed via immunoblot, flow cytometry, and ELISA. EV PD-L1: PD-1 binding was assessed using a competitive binding assay and in vitro functional assays testing the ability of EV PD-L1 to inhibit NOD CD8 T cells. Plasma EV and soluble PD-L1 were assayed in plasma of individuals with islet autoantibody positivity (Ab+) or recent-onset type 1 diabetes and compared to non-diabetic controls.

ResultsPD-L1 protein colocalized with tetraspanin-associated proteins intracellularly and was detected on the surface of beta cell EVs. 24-h IFN- or IFN-{square} treatment induced a two-fold increase in EV PD-L1 cargo without a corresponding increase in number of EVs. IFN exposure predominantly increased PD-L1 expression on the surface of beta cell EVs and beta cell EV PD-L1 showed a dose-dependent capacity to bind PD-1. Functional experiments demonstrated specific effects of beta cell EV PD-L1 to suppress proliferation and cytotoxicity of murine CD8 T cells. Plasma EV PD-L1 levels were increased in islet Ab+ individuals, particularly in those with single Ab+, Additionally, in from individuals with either Ab+ or type 1 diabetes, but not in controls, plasma EV PD-L1 positively correlated with circulating C-peptide, suggesting that higher EV-PD-L1 could be protective for residual beta cell function.

Conclusions/interpretationIFN exposure increases PD-L1 on the beta cell EV surface. Beta cell EV PD-L1 binds PD1 and inhibits CD8 T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Circulating EV PD-L1 is higher in islet autoantibody positive patients compared to controls.

So far, transpovirons seem to behave as commensal entities while some virophages exhibit commensal behavior under laboratory conditions. To study the systems behavior, we used a theoretical approximation and developed an ordinary differential equation model. The dynamical analysis showed that the system exhibits an oscillatory robust behavior leading to a hyperparasitic Lotka-Volterra dynamic.

Our data suggests that benzene metabolites trans,trans-muconaldehyde (MA), and hydroquinone (HQ) propagate endothelial activation and apoptosis analyzed by endothelial-specific microparticles in C57BL/6J mice plasma. Subcutaneous injections of MA and HQ increased vascular permeability by 1.54 fold and 1.27 fold correspondingly. In addition, the exposure of primary cardiac microvascular endothelial cells to MA increased vascular permeability detected by transendothelial monolayer resistance and by fluorescently labeled dextrans diffusion. The bulk RNA sequencing of endothelial cells exposed to MA for 2, 6, and 24 hours showed MA-dependent upregulation of heat shock-related pathways at 2 and 6 hours, dysregulation of GTPases at 6 hours, and altered cytoskeleton organization at 24 hours of exposure. We found that the HSP70 protein induced by MA in endothelial cells is colocalized with F-actin foci. HSP70 inhibitor 17AAG and HSP90 inhibitor JG98 attenuated MA-induced endothelial permeability, while HSP activator TRC enhanced endothelial leakage.

Among the viruses that encode miRNAs and infect cattle such as Bovine leukemia virus (BLV), Bovine foamy virus (BFV), Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), and Bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BoHV-5), BLV has gained increasing attention due to the critical role that BLV-miRNAs may play in inducing leukemia and lymphoma in infected animals. BLV is highly prevalent in the Americas and has a negatively affects dairy herds, primarily due to restrictions on the commercialization of dairy products from infected animals and a decrease in milk production.

Mixed infections involving BLV and BFV appear to be common in cattle. Considering the ability of foamy viruses to cross species barriers, preventing their presence within the food chain is essential. In this study, through small RNA sequencing, we identified the co-expression of seven BLV-derived miRNAs (blv-miR-B1-3p, blv-miR-B2-5p, blv-miR-B2-3p, blv-miR-B3-5p, blv-miR-B3-3p, blv-miR-B4-3p, and blv-miR-B5-5p) and three BFV-derived (bfv-miR-BF1-5p, bfv-miR-BF1-3p, and bfv-miR-BF2-5p) in naturally BLV-infected cattle, while no BoHV-1/5 miRNAs were detected.

In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Cdc42 activity displays anticorrelated oscillatory dynamics between the growing ends enabling bipolarity. Cdc42 at each end is activated only when the opposite end loses activity. This suggests that a regulator of Cdc42 likely travels end-to-end to activate Cdc42. The oscillatory dynamics between the growing ends have also been observed in Cdc42 activator Scd1, its scaffold Scd2. It is unclear how these proteins move between the ends to facilitate bipolarity. We find that Scd1 does not travel between the cell ends via actin-mediated delivery. Instead, we show that Scd1 is mostly cytoplasmic and diffuses between the cell ends. The rate of diffusion is not entirely proportional to increasing the mass of Scd1 and cells lacking the inhibitor Pak1 kinase show decreased diffusion. Moreover, we show that Scd1 diffuses at a much faster rate compared to its scaffold Scd2. These findings suggest that Scd1 diffusion is not random and is regulated by Pak1 kinase. We find that decreasing the rate of diffusion disrupts Cdc42 oscillatory dynamics and results in monopolarity. Our results show that end-to-end Scd1 diffusion drives Cdc42 oscillatory dynamics and regulates cell polarity.

By profiling fitness under multiple proteotoxic stresses, we uncover stress-specific vulnerabilities and reveal how major players of PQC mask correlations between transcriptomic responses and gene fitness. As an illustration of unexpected connections, we identify a heat-specific synthetic lethality between the disaggregase ClpB and DNA Polymerase I (PolA) mediated by persistent aggregation of the RecA recombinase and toxic persistence of the heat shock regulon.

Further, the HEP is thought to represent a neuronal prediction for each heartbeat, raising questions about its role in arrhythmia. Yet, previous studies have primarily focused on regular heart rhythms, with only a few investigations delving into arrhythmias and, notably, none into extrasystoles, a form of benign arrhythmias that disrupt the regular heart rhythm. Extrasystoles represent a unique possibility for investigating brain responses to unexpected pronounced alterations in heart rhythm. We took advantage of the largest dataset (103 subjects with 3000 extrasystoles), including both EEG and ECG recordings, and analysed the neural response to both types of extrasystoles (supraventricular and ventricular) using multiverse approaches and control analysis in time and source space. We found that the HEP was significantly reduced for ventricular extrasystoles with underlying sources in the left insular. For the postextrasystolic beat of both types of extrasystoles, we found a significantly earlier and increased HEP originating from sources in the left frontal orbital cortex and the anterior cingulate gyri. The reduced HEP response to the ventricular extrasystole might result from inactive interoceptive cardiac pathways. In contrast, increased HEP of the postextrasystolic beat along with the anatomical neural HEP generators may reflect an interoceptive prediction error arising from a naturally occurring discrepancy between the predicted and actual heart rhythm, with a main source in the anterior cingulate gyri, a primary location for prediction error processing.",NA,biorxiv

Phenomic prediction (PP) is a rapidly developing field that holds the potential to be used for the selection of genotypes early in the growing season. The objectives of this study were to compare the use and performance of GP and PP for predicting soybean seed yield, protein content, and oil content. We additionally conducted Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to identify significant SNPs associated with the traits of interest. These SNPs were also used to train the GP models. The GWAS panel of 292 diverse accessions was grown in six environments in replicated trials. Spectral data were collected at three timepoints during the growing season. A GBLUP model was trained on 268 accessions, while three separate machine learning (ML) models were trained on vegetation indices (VIs) and canopy traits. We observed that for PP, Random Forest (RF) algorithm had the highest rank correlation between the predicted and the actual phenotype rank. PP had a higher correlation coefficient than GP for seed yield, while GP had higher correlation coefficients for seed protein and oil contents. VIs with high feature importance were used as covariates in a new GBLUP model, and a new RF model was trained with the inclusion of selected SNPs from the GWAS results. These models did not outperform the original GP and PP models. These results show the capability of using ML for in-season predictions for specific traits in soybean breeding and provide insights on PP and GP inclusions in breeding programs.

Phenomic prediction provides an alternative opportunity that does not require the recurring costs of DNA sequencing. This research aimed to compare genomic and phenomic prediction in a diverse panel of soybeans. We found that phenomic prediction had the highest accuracy for seed yield, while genomic prediction was the best model for seed protein and oil.

A previous snail-trematode survey conducted at six lakes in central Alberta from 2013-2015 uncovered 79 trematode species. However, analyses suggested that additional species remained to be uncovered. To build on this baseline, we conducted further snail-trematode collections from 2019 to 2022 at eight reclaimed wetland sites in various stages of reclamation, along with one established lake in Alberta. Across the nine sites, we collected 22,397 snails, of which 1,981 were infected with digenean trematodes. We also documented broader biodiversity at these sites using traditional survey techniques. Through DNA barcoding, we identified 74 trematode species infecting five snail species. Among these were 23 trematode species not previously reported in central Alberta and nine putative novel species. In addition, we observed several previously unreported snail-trematode interactions. While trematode richness did not vary significantly with the wetland reclamation stage, host identity did influence richness: Physa gyrina hosted significantly more trematode species than Planorbella trivolvis. When combined with data from the earlier survey, sample completeness analyses indicate that we captured 100% of the dominant species and 99% of the typical species, but only 63% of the overall species diversity in central Alberta.

Through a neural activation screen followed by anatomical and functional connectivity assays, we further narrow down the key player of sleep regulation in the PB to a three-layer circuit composed of 4 SpsP neurons and their upstream and downstream synaptic partners: the 4 SpsP neurons act as an integrating hub by responding to ellipsoid body (EB) signals from EPG neurons, and by sending signals back to the EB through PEcG neurons. Moreover, sleep deprivation enriches the presynaptic active zones of SpsP neurons and strengthens the connections of the EPG-SpsP-PEcG circuit, indicating plasticity gating in the circuit in response to sleep drive change. As the SpsP neurons also receive input from the sensorimotor brain region and given their known role in navigation, these neurons potentially further integrate sleep drive with other sensorimotor cues.

Even for pathogens that have been present in a region for decades, such as beech bark disease (BBD), new waves of mortality are expected in host populations. Hence, there is a need for innovative approaches to monitor their advancement extensively in real-time. Here we test whether airborne hyperspectral imaging - involving data from 344 wavelengths in the visible, near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) - can be used to assess beech bark disease severity in southern Quebec, Canada. Field data on disease severity were linked to the airborne hyperspectral data for individual beech crowns. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) models using airborne imaging spectroscopy data predicted a small proportion of the variance in beech bark disease severity: the best model had an R2 of only 0.10. Wavelengths with the strongest contributions were from the NIR ([~]719 nm) and the SWIR ([~]1287 nm), which may suggest mediation by canopy greenness, water content and canopy architecture. Similar models using hyperspectral data taken directly on individual leaves had no explanatory power (R2 = 0). In addition, airborne and leaf-level hyperspectral datasets were uncorrelated. The failure of leaf-level models suggests that canopy structure was likely responsible for the limited predictive ability of the airborne model. Somewhat better performance in predicting disease severity was found using common band ratios for canopy greenness assessment (the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, gNDVI, the Red-edge Inflexion Point, REIP, and the Normalized Phaeophytinization Index, NPQI); these variables explained up to 19% of the variation in disease severity. Overall, we argue that the complexity of hyperspectral data is not necessary for assessing BBD spread and that spectral data in general may not provide an efficient means of improving BBD monitoring on a larger scale.",NA,biorxiv

The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and solar polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces an analogous pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Here we show evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that these bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we show long-term incorporation of this moonlight pattern into the ants path integration system throughout the night for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day.",NA,biorxiv

To contrast adaptive genetic variation across geography, we quantified population variation in tolerance traits and their thermal plasticity for five populations of Drosophila melanogaster from a 3000-km latitudinal gradient across east coast Australia, with eight populations from an environmentally heterogeneous 600x300km area within Victoria. Surprisingly, population variation in stress tolerance within Victoria was comparable to that across latitude. Consistent with local adaptation, heat and desiccation tolerance were greater for populations from warmer and drier environments, and populations from more predictable environments showed greater thermal plasticity. Adaptation to environmental heterogeneity at smaller geographic scales can therefore contribute more to adaptive capacity than originally thought. However, patterns of adaptation often changed across geography and treatments, which makes predicting responses to global change challenging.",NA,biorxiv

Using data-driven decomposition of fMRI responses in face-, body-, and scene-selective areas, we identified overlapping activity patterns shared across individuals. Each area encoded multiple interpretable dimensions tuned to both finer subcategory features and coarser cross-category distinctions beyond its preferred category, even in the most category-selective voxels. These dimensions formed distinct clusters within category-selective areas but were also sparsely distributed across the broader visual cortex, supporting both locally selective, category-specific, and globally distributed, feature-based coding.

VIAN-c4551, an antiangiogenic peptide analog of vasoinhibin, inhibits the growth and vascularization of melanoma tumors in mice. Because VIAN-c4551 is a potent inhibitor of vascular permeability, we evaluated whether its antitumor action extended to a reduction in metastasis generation.

MethodsCirculating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), lung vascular permeability, melanoma cell extravasation, and melanoma pulmonary nodules were assessed in C57BL/6J mice intravenously inoculated with murine melanoma B16-F10 cells after acute treatment with VIAN-c4551. VEGF levels, transendothelial electrical resistance, and transendothelial migration in cocultures of B16-F10 cells and endothelial cell monolayers supported the findings.

ResultsB16-F10 cells increased circulating VEGF levels and elevated lung vascular permeability 2 hours after inoculation. VIAN-c4551 prevented enhanced vascular permeability and reduced melanoma cell extravasation after 2 hours and the number and size of macroscopic and microscopic melanoma tumors in lungs after 17 days. In vitro, VIAN-c4551 suppressed the B16-F10 cell-induced and VEGF mediated increase in endothelial cell monolayer permeability and the transendothelial migration of B16-F10 cells.

ConclusionsThese findings support the inhibition of distant vascular permeability for the prevention of tumor metastasis and unveil the anti-vascular permeability factor VIAN-c4551 as a potential therapeutic drug able to prevent metastasis generation by lowering the extravasation of melanoma cells.",10.1371/journal.pone.0316983,biorxiv

The Solute Carrier (SLC) superfamily of integral membrane proteins transport a wide array of small molecules across plasma and organelle membranes, and function as important drug transporters and as viral receptors. They populate different conformational states during the solute transport process, including outward-open, intermediate (occluded), and inward-open conformational states. For some SLC proteins this structural ""flipping"" corresponds to swapping between conformations of their N-terminal and C-terminal symmetry-related sub-structures. Conventional AlphaFold2, AlphaFold3, or Evolutionary Scale Modeling methods typically generate models for only one of these multiple conformational states of SLC proteins. While several AI-based protocols for modeling multiple conformational states of proteins have been described recently, these methods are often impacted by ""memorization"" of one of the alternative conformational states, and do not always provide both the inward- and outward-open conformations of SLC proteins. Here we assess the impact of memorization in modeling SLC proteins with AlphaFold, and describe a combined ESM - template-based-modeling process, based on a previously described template-based modeling method that relies on the internal pseudo-symmetry of many SLC proteins, to consistently model the alternate conformational states of SLC proteins. We also demonstrate how the resulting multi-state models can be validated experimentally by comparison with sequence-based evolutionary co-variance data (ECs) that encode information about contacts present in the various conformational states adopted by the protein. This simple, rapid, and robust approach for modeling conformational landscapes of pseudo-symmetric SLC proteins is demonstrated for several integral membrane protein transporters, including SLC35F2 the receptor of a feline leukemia virus envelope protein required for viral entry into eukaryotic cells.",NA,biorxiv

Current treatments include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate (MTX), analgesics and physiotherapy. The most common DMARD is MTX, which binds to plasma proteins with low efficiency (50%) and has a half-life of 6 hours. Due to its limitations when administered orally, nanoparticles (NPs) have been proposed to overcome these limitations. NPs support the release of therapeutic molecules, minimizing side effects and increasing the bioavailability of the drug in a controlled administration. NPs synthesized from biodegradable polymers, such as polyglycolic lactic acid (PLGA), are convenient for drug delivery due to their high biocompatibility and ability to bind DMARDs such as MTX. PLGA NPs loaded with MTX (MTX-PLGA-NPs) have reduced the presence of proinflammatory factors such as IL-10 and TGF-{beta}, suggesting their potential as anti-inflammatory therapies for arthritis. Therefore, this study aims to develop MTX-PLGA-NPs in bioactive and biocompatible hyaluronic acid-eucalyptus (GelHA-E) hydrogels to preserve their stability and delay their degradation. PLGA-NPs were synthesized with an average hydrodynamic diameter of 200 nm, the 1237 cm-1 band found in FITR indicated the successful covalent conjugation with MTX; the mass loss of only 1% in GelHA-E indicated the thermogravimetric stability of the biomaterial and the low hemolytic and platelet aggregation percentage confirmed the biocompatibility of the biomaterial as a potential localized, anti-inflammatory, and injectable treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.",NA,biorxiv

In addition, these methods have been extended to probe a host of regulated steps in the RNA life cycle. Current bioinformatic tools significantly constrain analyses of NR-seq data. To address this limitation, we developed EZbakR, an R package to facilitate a more comprehensive set of NR-seq analyses, and fastq2EZbakR, a Snakemake pipeline for flexible preprocessing of NR-seq datasets, collectively referred to as the EZbakR suite. Together, these tools generalize many aspects of the NR-seq analysis workflow. The fastq2EZbakR pipeline can assign reads to a diverse set of genomic features (e.g., genes, exons, splice junctions, etc.), and EZbakR can perform analyses on any combination of these features. EZbakR extends standard NR-seq mutational modeling to support multi-label analyses (e.g., s4U and s6G dual labeling), and implements an improved hierarchical model to better account for transcript-to-transcript variance in metabolic label incorporation. EZbakR also generalizes dynamical systems modeling of NR-seq data to support analyses of premature mRNA processing and flow between subcellular compartments. Finally, EZbakR implements flexible and well-powered comparative analyses of all estimated parameters via design matrix-specified generalized linear modeling. The EZbakR suite will thus allow researchers to make full, effective use of NR-seq data.",NA,biorxiv

The task involved tritan stimuli, which are thought to convey visual information through S-cone signals that project to regions along the koniocellular pathway (tritan condition) and achromatic stimuli that preferentially activate luminance channels (luminance condition). Steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEPs) responses to the conditioned threat (CS+) and safety cues (CS-) in each condition were analyzed using a non-parametric Bayesian bootstrapped approach. Results showed that the tritan and luminance conditions exhibited greater ssVEP responses to the CS+ compared to the CS-stimuli in occipital sensors early into the trial (0 ms - 1000 ms; logBF10 > 2, decisive support). In addition to these early conditioning effects, a late conditioning effect was observed (1500 ms - 2500 ms) in the tritan condition that emerged in bilateral anterior sensors (logBF10 > 2). To further examine the tritan contribution to aversive learning, transitive Bayes factors were computed to compare the magnitude of the conditioning effects across conditions. Transitive Bayes factors showed that the early conditioning effect was larger in the luminance condition compared to the tritan condition (logBF10 > 2).

However, interpreting these models remains challenging, raising questions about the generalizability of inferred sequence functions. Cross-species prediction of transcription factor (TF) binding offers a promising approach to enhance model generalization by leveraging sequence variation across species, and it can contribute to the discovery of a conserved gene-regulatory code. However, addressing systematic differences between the genomes of various species is a significant challenge.

ResultsWe introduce MORALE, a framework that utilizes a well-established domain adaptation approach that is ""frustratingly easy."" MORALE trains on sequences from one or more source species and predicts TF binding on a single target species where no binding data is available. To learn an invariant cross-species sequence representation, MORALE aligns the first and second moments of the datagenerating distribution between all species. This direct approach integrates easily into representation learning models with an embedding layer. Unlike alternatives such as adversarial learning, it does not require additional parameters or other model design choices. We apply MORALE to two ChIP-seq datasets of liver-essential TFs: one comprising human and mouse, and another comprising five mammalian species. Compared to both a baseline and an adversarial approach termed gradient reversal (GRL), MORALE demonstrates improved performance across all TFs in the two-species case. Importantly, it avoids a performance degradation observed with the GRL approach in this study. Furthermore, feature attribution revealed that important motifs discovered by MORALE were closer to the actual TF binding motif compared with the GRL approach. For the five-species case, our method significantly improved TF binding site prediction for all TFs when predicting on human data, surpassing the performance of a human-only model -- a result not observed in the two-species comparison. Overall, MORALE is a direct and competitive approach that leverages domain adaptation techniques to improve cross-species TF binding site prediction.

Virus-free CRISPR-edited GD2 TRAC-CAR T cells have been developed as a potential means of improving CAR T efficacy but are not curative. Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) is a promising approach to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, it remains unclear whether RPT can synergize with GD2 TRAC-CAR T cells to improve outcomes in neuroblastoma.

MethodsDosimetry studies were conducted to measure the absorbed radiation dose delivered by lutetium-177 (177Lu) in both in vitro and in vivo models. Tumor-bearing mice were treated sequentially with low dose radiation by 177Lu-NM600, an alkylphosphocholine mimetic radiopharmaceutical agent, followed 9 days later by GD2 TRAC-CAR T cells generated in a virus-free manner by CRISPR/Cas9. Tumor burden was monitored through bioluminescence imaging and tumor size measurements. Mechanistic studies were performed using flow cytometry, multiplex assay and single-cell proteomic analysis.

ResultsLow dose radiation delivered by 177Lu-NM600 synergized with GD2 TRAC-CAR T cells in a localized neuroblastoma model, resulting in complete tumor regression in all mice. The optimal combination was dependent on both the radiation dose and timing to minimize the negative impact of radiation on CAR T cell viability. Irradiation of neuroblastoma cells by low-dose RPT before GD2 TRAC-CAR T cells enhanced the release by CAR T cells of perforin, granzyme B and cytokines like TNF- and IL-7 while abrogating TGF-{beta}1 secretion. Additionally, low-dose RPT upregulated Fas on neuroblastoma cells, potentially enabling a CAR-independent killing.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that low-dose RPT can enhance CAR T cell efficacy to treat a solid tumor. Findings suggest that optimization of radiation dose and timing may be needed for each patient and RPT to account for effects of varied tumor radiosensitivity and dosimetry.

Although the tight relationship between hyperosmotic shock and condensation has been characterized, the dynamics of biomolecular condensates in hyperosmotically compressed cells and their regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown.

ResultsWe used live-cell single-particle tracking (SPT) across different time scales to systematically characterize the dynamics of HOPS condensates formed by model protein mRNA decapping enzyme 1A (DCP1A). We found that HOPS condensates predominantly exhibited sub-diffusion rather than free diffusion, whereas some ([~]2%) exhibited short super-diffusion. Using tools measuring spatial accessibility inside cells and fluorescence labels for specific cellular organelles, we further revealed the origins of sub-diffusion and super-diffusion as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) attachment and coupling to microtubule-dependent active transport, respectively. Further, we reconstructed an accessibility map of the hyperosmotically compressed cell from trajectories of genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs), revealing that the cytoplasm of a compressed cell remains highly accessible without significant local corrals.

ConclusionsIn contrast to prior portrayals of the cytosolic space as static and constrained, our data suggest that the cytosol of a hyperosmotically compressed cell remains dynamic and accessible. Meanwhile, hyperosmotic and potentially other condensates can be spatially organized through docking to membrane structures, with intermittent episodes of long-range transport. These insights broaden our understanding of the physical environment within cells under hyperosmotic shock and provide a model for spatiotemporal organization of condensates via docking or coupling to existing cellular structures and processes.",NA,biorxiv

Prevailing models of motor control emphasize Bayesian models, which suggest that the system adjusts the current motor plan by integrating information from previous observations. While Bayesian integration has been extensively examined, those studies usually applied a highly stable and predictable environment. In contrast, in many real-life situations, motor goals change rapidly over time in a relatively unpredictable way, leaving it unclear whether Bayesian integration is useful in those natural environments. An alternative model that leverages prior information to improve performance is efficient coding, which suggests that the motor system maximizes the accuracy by dynamically tuning the allocation of the encoding resources based on environmental statistics. To investigate whether this adaptive mechanism operates in motor planning, we employed center-out reaching tasks with motor goals changing in a relatively unpredictable way, where Bayesian and efficient coding models predict opposite sequential effects. Consistent with the efficient coding model, we found that current movements were biased in the opposite direction of previous movements. These repulsive biases were amplified by intrinsic motor variability. Moreover, movement variability decreased when successive reaches were similar to each other. Together, these effects support the presence of efficient coding in motor planning, a novel mechanism with which the motor system maintains flexibility and high accuracy in dynamic environments.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we employed targeted bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq on paired tumor and non-tumor tissues from 80 Korean colorectal cancer (CRC) patients to map promoter methylation and gene expression dynamics. Promoters with high baseline methylation in non-tumor tissues tended to become hypomethylated in tumors, while those with low baseline methylation underwent partial hypermethylation. However, these changes did not consistently correlate with gene silencing or activation. Strikingly, promoters marked by Polycomb (PcG+) in non-tumor tissue were prone to hypermethylation yet often remained transcriptionally active in tumors, a paradox most prominent in transcription factor (TF) genes. In contrast, hypermethylation in PcG- promoters was more consistently associated with transcriptional repression. Our findings suggest that epigenetic plasticity at PcG+ TF gene promoters can override the typically repressive effects of DNA methylation, potentially enabling tumors to maintain or enhance the expression of key regulatory genes. This highlights the importance of PcG occupancy in shaping the functional consequences of methylation changes during colorectal tumorigenesis, warranting deeper investigation into how these epigenetic adaptations drive cancer progression.",NA,biorxiv

CRISPR-based genetic screens have proven invaluable in elucidating gene function in mammalian cells. Single-cell functional genomics methods, such as Perturb-seq and Spear-ATAC, have made it possible to achieve high-throughput mapping of the functional effects of gene perturbations by profiling transcriptomes and DNA accessibility, respectively. Combining single-cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic data via multiomic approaches has facilitated the discovery of novel cis and gene regulatory interactions. However, pseudobulk readouts from cell populations can often cloud the interpretation of results due to a heterogeneous response from cells receiving the same genetic perturbation, which could be mitigated by using transcriptional profiles of single cells to subset the ATAC-seq data. Existing methods to capture CRISPR guide RNAs to simultaneously assess the impact of genetic perturbations on RNA and ATAC profiles require either cloning of gRNA libraries in specialized vectors or implementing complex protocols with multiple rounds of barcoding. Here, we introduce CAT-ATAC, a technique that adds CRISPR gRNA capture to the existing 10X Genomics Multiome assay, generating paired transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and perturbation identity data from the same individual cells. We demonstrate up to 77% guide capture efficiency for both arrayed and pooled delivery of lentiviral gRNAs in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and cancer cell lines. This capability allows us to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in cells under drug and genetic perturbations. By applying CAT-ATAC, we were able to identify a GRN associated with dasatinib resistance, indirectly activated by the HIC2 gene. Using loss of function experiments, we further validated that the gene, ZFPM2, a component of the predicted GRN, also contributes to dasatinib resistance. CAT-ATAC can thus be used to generate high-content multidimensional genotype-phenotype maps to reveal novel gene and cellular interactions and functions.",NA,biorxiv

Bone developmental dynamics are influenced by whether an animal is ambulatory at birth (i.e., precocial). Precocial species, such as goats, develop advanced skeletal maturity in utero, making them useful models for studying the dynamics of bone formation under mechanical load. Here, we used microcomputed tomography and histology to characterize postnatal bone development in the autopod of the caprine lower forelimb. The caprine autopod features two toes, fused by metacarpal synostosis (i.e., bone fusion) prior to birth. Our analysis focused on the phalanges 1 (P1) and metacarpals of the goat autopod from birth through adulthood (3.5 years). P1 cortical bone densified rapidly after birth (half-life using one-phase exponential decay model ({tau}1/2 = 1.6 {+/-} 0.4 months), but the P1 cortical thickness increased continually through adulthood ({tau}1/2 = 7.2 {+/-} 2.7 mo). Upon normalization by body mass, the normalized polar moment of inertia of P1 cortical bone was constant over time, suggestive of structural load adaptation. P1 trabecular bone increased in trabecular number ({tau}1/2 = 6.7 {+/-} 2.8 mo) and thickness ({tau}1/2 = 6.6 {+/-} 2.0 mo) until skeletal maturity, while metacarpal trabeculae grew primarily through trabecular thickening ({tau}1/2 = 7.9 {+/-} 2.2 mo). Unlike prenatal fusion of the metacarpal diaphysis, synostosis of the epiphyses occurred postnatally, prior to growth plate closure, through a unique fibrocartilaginous endochondral ossification. These findings implicate ambulatory loading in postnatal bone development of precocial goats and identify a novel postnatal synostosis event in the caprine metacarpal epiphysis.",10.1002/dvdy.70038,biorxiv

Experimental studies alone struggle to resolve these dynamics, necessitating computational models. Among these, subcellular element modeling (SEM) has proven helpful in simulating cellular and tissue-scale emergent behaviors. However, traditional SEM frameworks lack explicit representations of nuclear mechanics and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, limiting their ability to capture key biology.

Here, we introduce BIOPOINT, a particle-based computational framework that extends SEM by incorporating (1) a deformable, multi-particle nucleus to simulate nuclear stress and strain distributions and (2) an explicit ECM representation using a structured array of static particles interacting via tunable adhesive potentials. To ensure biological relevance, we calibrated BIOPOINTs parameters against single-cell indentation experiments, overcoming prior limitations of ad hoc parameter selection in SEM. We validate BIOPOINT by comparing simulated cell behaviors to experimental observations in three key scenarios: (i) single-cell indentation, demonstrating agreement with force-time curves from atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies; (ii) cell spreading on ECM micropatterns, confirming that nuclear deformation follows ECM constraints; and (iii) nuclear deformation during confined migration, showing BIOPOINT predicts nuclear shape dynamics as cells traverse constrictions accurately.

BIOPOINT provides a computational framework for simulating nuclear mechanics and cell-ECM interactions with experimentally derived parameters. By integrating experimental data with a particle-based approach, BIOPOINT offers a practical tool for studying cell behavior that can inform future morphogenetic studies in-vivo or in-vitro.",NA,biorxiv

Despite extensive research, genetic and environmental factors contributing to HF remain complex and poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may play a crucial role in regulating HF-associated phenotypes. In this study, we leverage the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), a cohort of over 100 inbred mouse strains, to investigate the role of DNA methylation in HF progression.

ObjectiveWe aim to identify epigenetic modifications associated with HF by integrating DNA methylation data with gene expression and phenotypic traits. Using isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy and failure in HMDP mice, we explore the relationship between methylation patterns and HF susceptibility.

MethodsWe performed reduced representational bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to capture DNA methylation at single-nucleotide resolution in the left ventricles of 90 HMDP mouse strains under both control and ISO-treated conditions. We identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) using the MACAU algorithm. We identified likely candidate genes within each locus through integration of our results with previously reported sequence variation, gene expression, and HF-related phenotypes. In vitro approaches were employed to validate key findings, including gene knockdown experiments in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). We also examined the effects of preventing DNA methyltransferase activity on HF progression.

ResultsOur EWAS identified 56 CpG loci significantly associated with HF phenotypes, including 18 loci where baseline DNA methylation predicted post-ISO HF progression. Key candidate genes, such as Prkag2, Anks1, and Mospd3, were identified based on their epigenetic regulation and association with HF traits. In vitro follow-up on a number of genes confirmed that knockdown of Anks1 and Mospd3 in NRVMs resulted in significant alterations in cell size and blunting of ISO-induced hypertrophy, demonstrating their functional relevance in HF pathology.

Furthermore, treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor RG108 in ISO-treated BTBRT mice significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy and preserved ejection fraction compared to mice only treated with ISO, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting DNA methylation in HF. Differential expression analysis revealed that RG108 treatment restored the expression of several methylation-sensitive genes, further supporting the role of epigenetic regulation in HF.

ConclusionOur study demonstrates a clear interplay between DNA methylation, gene expression, and HF-associated phenotypes. We identified several novel epigenetic loci and candidate genes that contribute to HF progression, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms of HF. These findings underscore the importance of epigenetic regulation in cardiac disease and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for modifying HF outcomes through targeting DNA methylation.",NA,biorxiv

We established a fused HD dorsal-ventral system, imitating the cortex and striatum interaction in a single organoid to discover neurodevelopmental impairments at the level of cell populations. We found a range of early pathogenic phenotypes indicating that brain development in HD is affected by impaired neurogenesis. The phenotypes occurred already in early-stage 60-day organoids and the brain of humanized mouse embryos, at time of the beginning of the neurogenesis and choroid plexus development. We demonstrated that HD organoids and HD mouse embryonic brains had gene expression profiles of impaired maturation of neurons and increased expression of genes responsible for proliferation compared to genes responsible for differentiation in control organoids. By using scRNA-seq, the choroid plexus population was highly abundant in HD organoids and embryonic brains. Cortical and choroid plexus cell populations in HD organoids and brains co-expressed genes responsible for HTT function (mitotic spindle and cilia). The impaired maturation and the increased occurrence of the choroid plexus populations were mitigated in our compensatory model, mosaic dorsal/ventral (D/V) or V/D HD/control organoids. Finally, we found that TTR protein, a choroid plexus marker, is elevated in the adult HD mouse serum, indicating that TTR may be a promising marker for detecting HD. In summary, the fused dorso-ventral HD organoids identify a spectrum of neurodevelopmental features, including increased proliferation and delayed cell maturation. We demonstrate that the choroid plexus population is characteristic of aberrant HD neurodevelopment, and contains TTR marker, which can be translated as a blood marker in HD.",NA,biorxiv

We present a high-resolution single-cell transcriptomic dataset of over 22,000 high-quality epidermal LCs under both injured and homeostatic conditions. We found similar LCs responses to chemical and physical skin injuries. Our analysis defines specific LCs subpopulations representing sequential activation stages, characterized at the level of pathways and transcription factors. Notably, we identified a previously unrecognized population of activated LCs distinguished by the expression of complement system components and receptors. Integrating our data with an external dataset of wounded and unwounded skin revealed that wound-specific, WNT-modulated fibroblasts are the primary source of C3, the central component of the complement cascade. Intravital imaging of C3-deficient mice demonstrated that C3 is essential for the effective recruitment of activated LCs to wound sites. Together, these findings uncover a novel population of activated epidermal LCs and highlight complement signaling as a critical mediator of LCs recruitment during skin injury.",NA,biorxiv

In this study, we report that two atypical endo-{beta}-1,4-mannanases (MANs), which are not secreted and do not degrade glucomannan in the cell wall, play a novel role in glucomannan synthesis. Among the six MANs in Arabidopsis, AtMAN2 and AtMAN5 contain a transmembrane (TM) domain at their N-terminal region instead of a signal peptide. Subcellular localization using MAN protein fused with fluorescent protein demonstrated that AtMAN2 localizes to the Golgi apparatus in vascular and interfascicular fiber cells. We found that an Arabidopsis man2 man5 double mutant lost 65% of glucomannan in the cell walls of the inflorescence stem. Immunostaining revealed that the double mutant retained a small amount of glucomannan in the vacuole instead of secreting it to the cell walls. Arabidopsis possesses another atypical MAN, AtMAN6, with an HDEL retention signal at its C-terminus. However, mutation of AtMAN6 did not affect glucomannan content in the cell walls, suggesting distinct functions for these MANs. This study revealed that the function of AtMAN2 and AtMAN5 is necessary for normal glucomannan synthesis. We suggest that these man mutants point to an uncharacterized transport pathway in plant cells, through which glucomannan is trafficked to the vacuole instead of the cell walls.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTCell wall polysaccharides are synthesized from building block nucleotide sugars by the action of glucosyltransferases, but other factors facilitating the synthesis and secretion of large polysaccharides without aggregation remain to be identified. Here, we focused on the importance and functions of two atypical Arabidopsis endo-{beta}-1,4-mannanases that have a transmembrane domain instead of a secretion signal, and which are widely distributed in angiosperms but have not been well characterized. Arabidopsis mutants impaired in these endo-{beta}-1,4-mannanases lost 65% cell wall glucomannan, indicating that the hydrolysis by these enzymes is necessary for normal synthesis. Enhanced retention of glucomannan inside cells in the mutant hints at a transport route to deliver glucomannan to the vacuole.",NA,biorxiv

Contemporary research on motor sequence learning has been largely unimodal, ignoring the possibility that our nervous system might benefit from sensory inputs from multiple modalities. In this study, we investigated the properties of motor sequence learning in response to auditory-visual stimuli. We found that sequence learning with auditory-visual stimuli showed a hallmark feature of traditional unimodal sequence learning tasks: sensitivity to stimulus timing, where lengthier interstimulus intervals of 500 ms improved sequence learning compared to briefer interstimulus intervals of 200 ms. Consistent with previous findings, we also found that auditory-visual stimuli improved learning compared to a unimodal visual-only condition. Furthermore, the informativeness of the auditory stimuli was important, as auditory stimuli which predicted the location of visual cues improved sequence learning compared to uninformative auditory stimuli which did not predict the location of the visual cues. Our findings suggest a potential utility of leveraging audio-visual stimuli in sequence learning interventions to enhance skill acquisition in education and rehabilitation contexts.",NA,biorxiv

Interestingly, extracellular recordings in behaving subjects also show extrinsic-SFA (E-SFA) in response to sustained visual stimulation. Because neurons are isolated from brain networks in slice recordings, it is challenging to infer how I-SFA contributes to E-SFA in interconnected brains during behavior. To investigate this, we recorded responses of macaque lateral prefrontal cortex neurons in vivo during a visually guided saccade task and in acute brain slices in vitro. Broad spiking (BS) putative pyramidal cells and narrow spiking (NS) putative inhibitory interneurons exhibited E-SFA in vivo. In acute brain slices, both cell types displayed I-SFA though their magnitudes differed. To investigate how in vitro I-SFA contributes to in vivo E-SFA, we developed a data-driven hybrid circuit model in which local NS neurons are driven by BS input. We observed that model NS cell responses show longer SFA than observed in vivo. Introducing inhibition of NS cells to the model circuit removed this discrepancy. Our results indicate that both I-SFA and inhibitory circuit dynamics contribute to E-SFA in LPFC neurons.

Germ cell epigenetic alterations are proposed to bridge transgenerational reproductive defects resulting from EDCs. Previously, we have shown that prenatal exposure to environmentally relevant doses of BPA or its substitute, BPS, caused transgenerationally maintained reproductive impairments associated with neonatal spermatogonial epigenetic changes in male mice. While epigenetic alterations in germ cells can lead to transgenerational phenotypic variations, the mechanisms sustaining these changes across generations remain unclear.

ObjectivesThis study aimed to systematically elucidate the mechanism of transgenerational inherence by prenatal BPA and BPS exposure in the murine germline from F1 to F3 generations at both transcriptomic and epigenetic levels.

MethodsBPA or BPS with doses of 0 (vehicle control), 0.5, 50, or 1000 {micro}g/kg/b.w./day was orally administered to pregnant CD-1 females (F0) from gestational day 7 to birth. Sperm counts and motility were examined in F1, F2, and F3 adult males. THY1+ germ cells on postnatal day 6 from F1, F2, and F3 males at a dose of 50 {micro}g/kg/b.w./day were used for analysis by single-nucleus (sn) multi-omics (paired snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq on the same nucleus).

ResultsPrenatal exposure to BPA and BPS with 0.5, 50, and 1000 {micro}g/kg/b.w./day reduced sperm counts in mice across F1 to F3 generations. In the F1 neonatal germ cells, ancestral BPA or BPS exposure with 50 {micro}g/kg/b.w./day resulted in increased differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with spermatogonial differentiation. It also disrupted the balance between maintaining the undifferentiated and differentiating spermatogonial populations. Differentially accessible peaks (DAPs) by snATAC-seq were primarily located in the promoter regions, with elevated activity of key transcription factors, including SP1, SP4, and DMRT1. Throughout F1-F3 generations, biological processes related to mitosis/meiosis and metabolic pathways were substantially up-regulated in BPA-or BPS-exposed groups. While the quantities of DEGs and DAPs were similar in F1 and F2 spermatogonia, with both showing a significant reduction in F3. Notably, approximately 80% of DAPs in F1 and F2 spermatogonia overlapped with histone post-translational modifications linked to transcription activation, such as H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K27ac. Although BPA exerted more potent effects on gene expression in F1 spermatogonia, BPS induced longer-lasting effects on spermatogonial differentiation across F1 to F3 males. Interestingly, DMRT1 motif activity was persistently elevated across all three generations following ancestral BPA or BPS exposure.

DiscussionOur work provides the first systematic analyses for understanding the transgenerational dynamics of gene expression and chromatin landscape following prenatal exposure to BPA or BPS in neonatal spermatogonia. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to environmentally relevant doses of BPA or BPS alters chromatin accessibility and transcription factor motif activities, consequently contributing to disrupted transcriptional levels in neonatal germ cells, and some are sustained to F3 generations, ultimately leading to the reduction of sperm counts in adults.",NA,biorxiv

We show that HPL-2 represses transcription and supports organogenesis independently of H3K9me binding, whereas complete loss of met-2 and hpl-2 causes severe transcriptional and developmental defects. MET-2 and HPL-2 rely on different binding partners - the disordered protein LIN-65/ATF7IP and the multi-zinc finger protein LIN-13, respectively - for localization and function.

Previous studies have associated DNAm with IBD, and first- and second-generation epigenetic clocks with IBD subtypes.

ResultsIn a discovery IBD cohort (n=149) with 8-year clinical follow-up data, we explored the relationship between DNAm variation, second- and third-generation epigenetic clocks, and IBD clinicopathological outcomes, including disease subtype, activity, and recurrence. One CpG site was significantly differentially methylated (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value<0.05) in patients with clinical recurrence of disease over the long term (i.e., after the first year of study) compared to non-recurrence (no treatment escalation after 8 years). Next, we assessed DNAm aging signatures and IBD outcomes using logistic regression. Individuals with IBD exhibited significantly increased epigenetic aging, as measured by GrimAge, GrimAge2, and DunedinPACE, compared with controls. These associations were replicated in two independent IBD cohorts (GSE87648 (n=377) and GSE112611 (n=238)). Additionally, in UC patients, the active disease group was associated with higher age acceleration (GrimAge (U=669, p=0.003)) and higher pace of aging (DunedinPACE (t=3.233, 0.002)) compared to the inactive group. In the discovery cohort, DunedinPACE outperforms CRP measures in discriminating activity in UC patients with an AUC, sensitivity and specificity of 0.71, 69.5% and 68.7% respectively, highlighting its potential as a useful biomarker of activity in UC.

ConclusionsOverall, we present strong evidence that dynamic age-related DNAm changes can be used to differentiate between IBD (including separately by subtype) and controls. Furthermore, our study provides important new evidence that DunedinPACE may have utility as a biomarker for monitoring disease recurrence in IBD patients and may be a strong marker of disease activity in UC patients. Overall, this suggests that blood-based DNAm signatures could serve as biomarkers for detection and monitoring of IBD.",NA,biorxiv

This led to improved CD8+ T cell-dependent tumor restriction. However, cGAMP limits the proliferation, survival, and function of STING-expressing but not of STING-deficient CD8+ T cells. In vivo, STING deficiency in CD8+ T cells enhanced tumor restriction. Consequently, cancer-cell-derived cGAMP both drives and limits the anti-tumor potential of CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, T cell-intrinsic STING is associated with pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative gene signatures. Our findings suggest that STING signaling acts as a checkpoint in CD8+ T cells that balances tumor immunity.

It is critical to access the virological and antigenic characteristics of these emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we found that LF.7.2.1 is significantly more immune invasive than XEC, primarily due to the A475V mutation, which enabled the evasion of Class 1 neutralizing antibodies. However, LF.7.2.1s weak ACE2 binding affinity substantially impaired its fitness. Likewise, MC.10.1 and NP.1 exhibited strong antibody immune evasion due to the A435S mutation, but their limited ACE2 engagement efficiency restricted their growth advantage, suggesting that A435S may regulate the Spike conformation, similar to the NTD glycosylation mutations found in KP.3.1.1 and XEC. Most importantly, we found that LP.8.1 showed comparable humoral immune evasion to XEC but demonstrated much increased ACE2 engagement efficiency, supporting its rapid growth. These findings highlight the trade-off between immune evasion and ACE2 engagement efficiency in SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and underscore the importance of monitoring LP.8.1 and its descend lineages.",10.1016/S1473-3099(25)00015-5,biorxiv

Several studies have mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in chondrocytes and colocalized them with OA GWAS variants to identify putative OA risk genes; however, the degree to which genetic variants influence OA risk via alternative splicing has not been explored. We investigated the role of alternative splicing in OA pathogenesis using RNA-seq data from 101 human chondrocyte samples treated with PBS (control) or fibronectin fragment (FN-f), an OA trigger. We identified 590 differentially spliced genes between conditions, with FN-f inducing splicing events similar to those in primary OA tissue. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to mimic an SNRNP70 splicing event observed in OA and FN-f-treated chondrocytes and found that it induced an OA-like expression pattern. Integration with genotyping data revealed 7,188 splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) affecting 3,056 genes. While many sQTLs were shared, we identified 738 and 343 condition-specific sQTLs for control and FN-f, respectively. We identified 15 RNA binding proteins whose binding sites were enriched at sQTL splice junctions and found that expression of those RNA binding proteins correlated with exon inclusion.

Nixtamalization moisture content, a measure of the quantity of water absorbed during the nixtamalization of a grain such as maize, has a large impact on the end-quality of masa-based products. An application to predict nixtamalization moisture content from raw inbred and hybrid maize grain was recently developed, but its utility in a breeding context has not been assessed. Important breeding considerations for nixtamalization moisture content were assessed in diverse maize hybrids, modern commercial hybrids, and historically high-acreage hybrids grown in up to three environments across two years. This study demonstrated that nixtamalization moisture content is heavily influenced by growing conditions, but sufficient genetic variance is present to allow breeders to make gains from selection. Contrary to prior theory, there was no substantial correlation between nixtamalization moisture content and yield suggesting breeders can select for both traits without negatively impacting either trait. Both additive and dominant genetic action was observed and genomic prediction was able to predict nixtamalization moisture content in hybrids with an average Spearmans rank correlation coefficient greater than 0.441 and a root mean square error below 0.006. The findings here suggest that nixtamalization moisture content can be selected for early in breeding cycles, allowing breeders to develop improved food-grade maize germplasm without negatively impacting important traits such as yield.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARYPlant breeders need to understand the biological mechanisms underlying a trait of interest to maximize the efficiency of their efforts. Nixtamalization moisture content is a highly complex trait that is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. In this study, nixtamalization moisture content was assessed in a diverse set of hybrid and inbred maize to understand the biological mechanisms underlying nixtamalization moisture content. The relationship between nixtamalization moisture content and yield was assessed, the genetic architecture and mode of gene action underlying nixtamalization moisture content were evaluated, and the efficacy of genomic prediction in assessing nixtamalization moisture content was determined. The findings of this study will allow breeders to create optimized breeding strategies for nixtamalization moisture content, thus improving the raw materials that are used to produce globally consumed products such as tortillas and tortilla chips.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we report two ultrasmall chemogenetic tags (mgTag and cTag) of 36 and 50 amino acids (aa) that, to the best of our knowledge, are the smallest reported. These tags exhibit transferase-type reactivity with their ligands to append any moiety of interest to the tag. cTag utilizes an engineered C1 domain-bearing cysteine that undergoes group-transfer reaction with its ligand. Likewise, mgTag utilizes an engineered zinc-finger domain-bearing cysteine that undergoes group-transfer reaction with its molecular-glue ligand in the presence of cereblon (CRBN). We applied these tags in the context of cell signaling and proximity induction. While the fusion of HaloTag (297 aa) to the KRASG12D (188 aa) disrupted its ability to activate the growth-signaling pathway, fusion of mgTag or cTag did not. Group-transfer of BRD4 binder to tags appended to Abelson kinase (ABL) induced proximity between ABL and BRD4, resulting in the latters phosphorylation. Deletion of the transferase-type reactivity reduced phosphorylation levels, suggesting that proximity-inducing chimeras with group-transfer design may be more efficacious in certain scenarios. We envision these ultrasmall tags to have wide-ranging applications, including in basic science, biotechnology, and medicine.

In line with the societal goal to replace or reduce vertebrate animal testing, alternative bioassays were developed to replace testing with fish: the fish cell line RTgill-W1 acute toxicity assay (OECD TG249) and the zebrafish embryo acute toxicity test (zFET, OECD TG236). However, previous studies revealed the lower sensitivity of the RTgill-W1 cell line assay and zFET for some neurotoxic chemicals and allyl alcohol, which is presumably biotransformed in fish to the more toxic acrolein (which is predicted well through the cell line assay). To provide an additional alternative to acute fish toxicity, in this study, we analyzed historic ecotoxicity data for fish and daphnids from the EnviroTox Database. We found a considerable variability in acute fish LC50 and acute daphnids EC50 values, particularly for neurotoxic chemicals. Comparing sensitivity of these taxonomic groups according to different neurotoxicity classification schemes indicates that fish rarely represent the most sensitive trophic level of the two. Exceptions here most prominently include a few cyclodiene compounds, which are no longer marketed, and a chemical group that could be identified through structural alerts. Moreover, daphnids are more sensitive than fish to acrolein. This analysis highlights the potential of the Daphnia acute toxicity test, which is usually a standard regulatory data requirement, in safeguarding the environmental protection level provided by the RTgill-W1 cell line assay and the zFET. This research, rooted in decades of efforts to replace the fish acute toxicity test, shifts the focus from predicting fish toxicity 1-to-1 to emphasizing the protectiveness of alternative methods, paving the way for further eliminating vertebrate tests in environmental toxicology.",NA,biorxiv

Reactivation of NSCs requires changes in gene expression, much of which is regulated at the epigenomic level. We mapped, comprehensively and in vivo, the dynamic epigenomic changes in NSC chromatin during stem cell quiescence and reactivation in Drosophila. Contrary to expectations, we found that chromatin accessibility is increased in quiescent NSCs, remodelling extensively within both euchromatin and heterochromatin. Surprisingly, genes crucial for cell cycle progression are repressed whilst remaining within permissive H3K36me3-bound euchromatin. At the same time, genes necessary for cell-cell communication are derepressed by eviction of histone H1 and transition to a SWI/SNF-enriched active state. Our results reveal global expansion of accessible chromatin in quiescent NSCs without concomitant activation of transcription. Strikingly, this process reverses upon reactivation, indicating that opening of chromatin is a quiescence-specific event.",NA,biorxiv

This effect is also present in the absence of electromyographic feedback.

The contribution of factors produced by migrating neurons in the morphogenesis of a developing cerebral cortex remains largely unknown. Our previous research revealed that a radial-migrating neuron must navigate to bypass its post-migratory predecessor, which resides at the dorsal border of the developing cortical plate, before reaching its final position. This final stage of radial migration ensures adherence to the ""inside-out"" pattern at the cellular level. However, whether neurons consistently preserve their sequential order during the prolonged radial migration period remains uncertain. In this study, we found that nascent neurons form queues perpendicular to the cortical plate during radial migration, extending across the upper cortical plate by approximately embryonic day 19. Within each queue, the leading neuron acts as a barrier, restricting the radial migration of the following neuron to preserve their order. We further discovered that the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) functions cell-type autonomously in both the leading and following neurons to maintain their sequential order. We find that DSCAM in neurons is necessary to generate a gap between migrating neurons by suppressing N-cadherin-mediated adhesion. Without N-cadherin adhesion, the trailing neuron fails to assemble F-actin at the proximal end of the leading process, preventing its expansion and subsequently hindering nucleokinesis. In Dscam null mutant or Cre-induced knock-out, this gap is not observed, allowing N-cadherin adhesion to persist. Consequently, all migrating neurons keep moving directly to the dorsal border of the cortical plate, and the queue of migrating neurons does not form. This research reveals that DSCAM preserves the sequential order of neurons during radial migration, playing a crucial role in ""inside-out"" cortico-genesis.",NA,biorxiv

Households protected their bins, yet cockatoos have learned to defeat these defences. In response, residents increased their defence-level, setting the stage for a behavioral ""arms race"". Here, we investigate this arms race by combining field observations with agent-based modeling. We systematically document protections in a suburban locality over two years, revealing spatial clustering of protections indicative of social learning among residents. We find that protections have decreased since 2019, and overly-costly protection is dis-preferred. With a controlled assay, we characterize the knowledge of local cockatoos, finding differential proficiency in defeating protections. Surprisingly, we identified several cockatoos that can defeat high-efficacy protections, such as locks. Finally, we simulate interactions between two populations of learning agents representing households and cockatoos. We find that social learning accelerates adaptation in both species, while coordination reduces costs associated with defensive escalation. However, policy interventions can have unintended consequences, accelerating cockatoos skill acquisition and shifting conflict to neighboring areas.

Virtual screening of VEGFA inhibitors led to the discovery of six significant hits, including three from the ChemDiv library (D519-0372, G868-0191, and Y031-5201) and three from the ZINC20 database (ZINC57658, ZINC57652, ZINC57679). Molecular dynamics simulations highlighted G868-0191 as the most stable VEGFA inhibitor. Two repurposed drugs, Sunitinib and Ticlopidine hydrochloride, were also identified as potential candidates. In addition, the down-regulated hub genes GABARAPL1, OPTN, and CDH8 were proposed as potential biomarkers for glioblastomas.

ConclusionThis study underscores the significance of immune-related hub genes in glioblastoma pathology and suggests new VEGFA inhibitors as promising therapeutic agents. The identification of down-regulated genes as potential biomarkers offers further avenues for clinical application. However, experimental validation is needed to confirm the clinical utility of these findings.",NA,biorxiv

Using vRep, we established the Huge Phage Genome Collection (HPGC), a curated resource of 7,295 non-redundant huge phage genomes spanning 4,613 species-level groups. Within HPGC, we identified an overlooked and prevalent clade, HP8026, which constitutes ~1.2% of human gut metagenomic reads, suggesting its potential in fecal contamination monitoring and a promissing modulator of gut microbiome dynamics. Complementing HPGC, we developed the Huge Phage Protein Structure Database (HPDB), which catalogs 15,594 structure clusters derived from 589,960 predicted proteomes. Notably, 40% of these clusters presented in huge phages only, exhibit specific protein folds. Additionally, 3% of the HPDB clusters were absent in other viral forms, including the plasmid-originated ArdC that could protect huge phages from the antiviral mechanisms of their hosts.

For example, the intention to grasp and pick up an object results in representations of the objects weight. But these representations become grasp-specific only immediately before object lift if weight information is relayed through object material. This feature triggers earlier representations regardless of intention probably because material-weight contingencies are overlearned. By contrast, recently learned weight cues should be recalled deliberately during grasp planning resulting in early grasp-specific representations. Here, we examined how action intentions affect the representation of newly acquired colour-weight contingencies. We recorded electroencephalography while human participants grasped or reached for objects that varied in shape and density as indicated by their colour. Multivariate analyses revealed a grasp-specific reactivation of colour during planning that was mirrored in beta band. This suggests that task-relevancy influences the representation of colour such that previously encoded colour-weight contingencies may be reactivated as required for grasping, mediated top-down via working memory. Grasp-specific representations of shape and colour were also present in theta band, perhaps reflecting attentional activity. These results provide novel insights into the interplay between cognition and motor planning processes.

Significance StatementRecent research shows that the object feature weight, conveyed via highly overlearned material-weight contingencies, is more prominently represented within electrophysiological signals when people intend to grasp an object to lift it vs. reach for it. However, such differences occur late, immediately before object lift. Our study is the first to show that newly learned colour-weight contingencies yield early task-specific representations during action planning; we find that colour/weight representations, forming 140-210 ms after object onset, reactivate around 270 ms during grasp, but not reach planning, with the same pattern arising for beta band. These data suggest that the brain deliberately processes weight information depending on intention, arguably involving working memory representations. Our results highlight the interplay of cognition and motor planning.",NA,biorxiv

Reconstruction of single-neuron axonal projections requires intensive manual operations in tens of terabytes of brain imaging data, and is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive. The main issue lies in the need for precise reconstruction algorithms to avoid reconstruction errors, yet current methods struggle with densely distributed axons, focusing mainly on skeleton extraction. To overcome this, we introduce a point assignment-based method that uses cylindrical point sets to accurately represent axons and a minimal information flow tree model to suppress the snowball effect of reconstruction errors. Our method successfully reconstructs single-neuron axonal projections across hundreds of GBs images with an average of 80% F1-score, while current methods only provide less than 40% F1-score reconstructions from a few hundred MBs images.

Loss of function in CFTR causes the life-threatening disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The functionally open state of CFTR has so far eluded detailed structural characterization. Although multiple near-atomic resolution structures of CFTR have been solved under conditions that promote channel opening, they all lack a continuous ion conduction pathway. In recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, structural fluctuations of human CFTR in a hydrated lipid bilayer led to the observation of transient Cl- conducting states, but the stability and conduction properties of these putative open states were not established. Here, we conduct massively repeated simulations initiated from these Cl- permeable conformations. Reproducible structural relaxation of the pore leads to a stable open conformation featuring five symmetrically arranged pore-lining helices. Unlike previously reported structures, this novel penta-helical arrangement reproduces experimentally determined properties of the open pore, including a Cl- conductance close to that measured at physiological voltages. Together, our results support the validity of this newly identified pore conformation as a model of the fully open channel. Detailed analysis highlights the role of cationic pore-lining residues in the Cl- permeation mechanism and suggests that the kinks observed in several transmembrane helices play a role in channel gating.",NA,biorxiv

Understanding the hosts immune response to both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms of pathogenesis and resistance. This study aims to assess the cellular immune responses, including PBMC proliferation, cytokine secretion (IL-4 and IL-17a), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in response to live drug-sensitive and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolates.

MethodsPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PPD-negative and PPD-positive healthy volunteers were stimulated with live M. tuberculosis isolates, including MDR, SI-resistant, and sensitive strains. The immune responses were assessed by evaluating cell proliferation, secretion of IL-4 and IL-17a cytokines, and ROS production over a 9-day period.

ResultsPBMCs from PPD-positive individuals exhibited a higher proliferative response compared to PPD-negative individuals, indicating more robust immune memory. IL-4 secretion was low but varied among samples, with higher levels observed in response to MDR isolates, suggesting a potential role in immunopathology. IL-17a levels increased over time, particularly in PPD-positive individuals, and MDR strains elicited a stronger response than sensitive isolates. ROS production was significantly elevated in response to resistant strains, reflecting the hosts oxidative defense mechanisms.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates distinct immune responses to drug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates, with variations in cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and ROS production. These findings provide insights into the immune dynamics during infection with resistant strains and underscore the importance of genotype-environment interactions in TB pathogenesis.

Little is known about if and how prior knowledge affect emergence of such novel responses. Remarkably, our brain not only arrives at these responses through logical inferences but can also preserve these related memories distinctly without catastrophic interference. Often mental schema has been proposed to be the framework for such phenomenon. In this study, using mice as a model animal, we show that schematic networks not only enhance the cognitive load handling capacity (CLHC) preventing catastrophic interference, but also enable the generation of novel responses that are context relevant. Interestingly, when the animals were trained in a paradigm that did not invoke the pre-formed mental schema, we observed neither an enhancement to CLHC nor a generation of novel context relevant responses. Using these principles of mental schema that we discovered from our animal experiments, we develop a neurologically relevant ANN that avoids catastrophic interference and captures all the properties associated with different modes of learning tested in our experiments. The custom architecture of the ANN enables it to generate responses similar to animals in novel scenario.",NA,biorxiv

In recent years, oligogalacturonides (OGs), fragments of pectin resulting from the degradation of the plant cell wall, have been particularly under focus for their ability to induce plant defense, leading to plant protection against pathogens. In the current work, 2 mixtures of OGs, bio-sourced from sugar beet by-products, were produced and assessed for their protective efficacy on wheat against Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), responsible for powdery mildew. These OGs pools were obtained by hydrolysing pectins with two A. thaliana polygalacturonases (PGs), ADPG2 and PGLR (EC 3.2.1.15), produced in heterologous system Pichia pastoris. No direct effect of OGs generated by either ADPG2, named OGs-ADPG2 (degree of polymerisation/DP 1-10 and degree of esterification/DE 41%) or PGLR, named OGs-PGLR (DP 1-16, DE 34 %), was observed on Bgt spore germination in vitro. After a preventive foliar spraying of wheat by OGs, only OGs-PGLR provided a 31 % partial protection against Bgt. Both pools of OGs triggered an increase in the expression of some plant defense-related genes (peroxidase or PR proteins encoding genes), before inoculation with the pathogen. However, only OGs-PGLR induced the expression of a gene encoding a lipoxygenase (LOX), which is the first enzyme involved in the octadecanoic pathway, leading to oxylipins production in plant defense. Taking together, these findings revealed that some OGs, produced from sugar beet by-products by enzymatic hydrolysis, could be used as an alternative of phytochemicals.",NA,biorxiv

However, their specific labeling methods in living cells are limited. To address this, we have developed replication-dependent histone labeling (Repli-Histo labeling) to label nucleosomes in euchromatin and heterochromatin based on DNA replication timing. We investigated local nucleosome motion in the four chromatin classes from euchromatin to heterochromatin of living human and mouse cells. We found that more euchromatic regions (earlier replicated regions) show greater nucleosome motion. Notably, the motion profile in each chromatin class persists throughout interphase. Genome chromatin is essentially replicated from regions with greater nucleosome motions, even though the replication timing program is perturbed. Our findings, combined with computational modeling, suggest that earlier replicated regions have more accessibility and local chromatin motion can be a major determinant of genome-wide replication timing.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we used two separate translational motion stimuli as the main stimulation protocols and conducted in vivo electrophysiological experiments in the pigeons Imc. By combining bio-plausible model validation, we found two types of inhibitory surrounds of the Imc neuron receptive field, homogenous inhibitory surrounds (HIS) and non-homogenous inhibitory surrounds (non-HIS), and elucidated the mechanism by which both arise. While HIS is local and depends on stimulus feature similarity, which can be used to compute stimulus saliency, non-HIS is global and doesnt depend on stimulus feature similarity, which can be used to compute stimulus selection. Moreover, the superimposition of HIS and non-HIS modulates the neural response of Imc. The two inhibitory surrounds of Imc identified in this study more clearly elucidate the full process of achieving bottom-up stimulus selection based on saliency in the midbrain network and show that Imc is a nucleus that can represent both stimulus saliency and stimulus selection.",NA,biorxiv

The developmental trajectory of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex accounted remarkably well for working memory improvements. While complex aspects of activity changed progressively during adolescence, such as the rotation of stimulus representation in multidimensional neuronal space, which has been implicated in cognitive flexibility, even simpler attributes, such as the baseline firing rate in the period preceding a stimulus appearance had predictive power over behavior. Unexpectedly, decreases in brain volume and thickness, which are widely thought to underlie cognitive changes in humans 5 did not predict well the trajectory of neural activity or cognitive performance changes. Whole brain cortical volume in particular, exhibited an increase and reached a local maximum in late adolescence, at a time of rapid behavioral improvement. Maturation of long-distance white matter tracts linking the frontal lobe with areas of the association cortex and subcortical regions best predicted changes in neuronal activity and behavior.

Statins, commonly used to lower cholesterol, have demonstrated certain selective toxicity towards KRAS-transformed cells, prompting the question of whether statins could achieve selective uptake specifically in KRASMUT cells. To investigate this, we synthesized statin-dye conjugates by attaching a fluorescent dye (Cy5.5) to two statins: simvastatin and pravastatin, aiming to assess whether selective uptake indeed occurs. Our findings revealed that these conjugates exhibited markedly enhanced uptake in KRASMUT cells compared to KRAS wild-type (KRASWT) cells. Given the magnitude of the selective uptake, we realized that the uptake of these conjugates itself is of considerable intrinsic interests. We evaluated the uptake of these conjugates in both KRASMUT and KRASWT cells and examined their potential to selectively target KRASMUT pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) using an engineered PDAC tumor model co-cultured with PCCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Our findings indicate that KRASMUT cancer cells exhibited higher uptake of statin-Cy5.5 conjugates via enhanced macropinocytosis compared to KRASWT cancer cells and CAFs.

We used a genetic mouse model of LS in which the NDUFS4 gene is knocked out (KO) specifically in Vglut2 or Gad2 neurons. We found increased variability of the swallow motor pattern, disruption in breathing regeneration post swallow, and water-induced apneas only in Vglut2 KO mice. These physiological changes likely contribute to weight loss and premature death seen in this mouse model. Following chronic hypoxia (CH) exposure, swallow motor pattern, breathing regeneration, weight, and life expectancy were not changed in the Vglut2-Ndufs4-KO CH mice compared to control, indicating a rescue of phenotypes.

We investigated how the mechanisms underlying climate-driven directional change in community composition were mediated by habitat fragmentation. We found thermophilization driven by increasing warm-adapted species and decreasing cold-adapted species in terms of trends in colonization rate, extinction rate, occupancy rate and population size. Critically, colonization rates of warm-adapted species increased faster temporally on smaller or less isolated islands; cold-adapted species generally were lost more quickly temporally on closer islands. This provides support for dispersal limitation and microclimate buffering as primary proxies by which habitat fragmentation mediates species range shift.

The underlying mechanism responsible for the development and maintenance of chronic pain remains unclear. gp120 is a causal factor of the HIV-PAIN and functions as an exogenous algogen. The pain experienced by human HIV-PAIN has been modeled in mice (referred to as mHIV-PAIN) using intrathecal (i.t.) injections of gp120. gp120 is a relatively short-term, static, exogenous algogen that is exhaustible in vivo. In authentic infection, HIV virions serve as the primary source of exogenous gp120, which initiates the early phase of clinical HIV-PAIN. Interestingly, while the source of replenishing gp120 decreases after antiretroviral therapy by suppressing viremia, the prevalence of chronic HIV-PAIN remains stable. To induce chronic pain in mice, gp120 needs to be repeatedly applied by the i.t. route. This raises a key question: Is an endogenous inexhaustible algogen responsible for maintaining the chronicity of HIV-PAIN?

In the present study, we isolated circulating small extracellular vesicles (sEV) from mice using our mHIV-PAIN model that is i.t. injected with gp120. We refer to such sEV as gp120-sEV herein. We observed that gp120 is absent in gp120-sEV. Following transfusion of gp120-sEV intrathecally, naive recipient mice exhibit an extensive pain phenotype, including cold pain tested with we newly invented dry ice vapor cold test. RNA-sequence analysis suggests that gp120-sEVs induced expression of genes related to nociception and neuroinflammation pathways. These findings provide direct evidence that circulating sEV function as endogenous long-term ""dynamic"" algogens that enhance initial pain and extend the chronification of HIV-PAIN in mice, suggesting that chronic HIV-PAIN requires an exogenous algogen (gp120) paired with endogenous algogen (gp120-sEV), and that these components work synchronically to initiate and extend pain chronification. This double algogen concept provides a new insight into the pathogenesis of HIV-PAIN chronification. Our new mechanistic understanding will also assist in identifying new therapeutics to alleviate HIV-PAIN by targeting pathological gp120-sEV.",NA,biorxiv

In the brain, many decisions are implemented as a race between competing evidence-accumulation processes. We ask whether the neurons that represent evidence accumulation also carry information about whether the choice is correct (i.e., confidence). Monkeys performed a reaction time version of the random dot motion task. Neuropixels probes were used to record from neurons in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area. LIP neurons with response fields that overlap the choice-target contralateral to the recording site (Tin neurons) represent the accumulation of evidence in favor of contralateral target selection. We demonstrate that shortly before a contralateral choice is reported, the population of Tin neurons contains information about the accuracy of the choice (i.e., whether the choice is correct or incorrect). This finding is unexpected because, on average, Tin neurons exhibit a level of activity before the report that is independent of reaction time and evidence strength--both strong predictors of accuracy. This apparent contradiction is resolved by examining the variability in neuronal responses across the population of Tin neurons. While on average, Tin neurons exhibit a stereotyped level of activity before a contralateral choice, many neurons depart from this average in a consistent manner. From these neurons, the accuracy of the choice can be predicted using a simple logistic decoder. The accuracy of the choice predicted from neural activity reproduces the hallmarks of confidence identified in human behavioral experiments. Therefore, neurons that represent evidence accumulation can also inform the monkeys confidence.",10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115526,biorxiv

The evolution of indicator species provides an efficient avenue towards the functional biome response to climate change. Leveraging decades of citizen science data coupled with high-resolution spatiotemporal climate data, I dissected the climate change response of hybridizing Setophaga warblers, indicator species breeding in the mysterious canopy of the Pacific Rainforest. Breeding habitat temperature and precipitation powerfully predicted the breeding occupancy of the northern (S. townsendi) and the southern species (S. occidentalis). Both species showed positive climatic responses in the recent decade when the recent breeding occupancy was greater than the expected contingency. This implies the potential climate adaptation or life history plasticity in the breeding warbler populations. However, the S. occidentalis showed a compromised climate response in 2000-10, when the predicted breeding occupancy was significantly lower than the expected contingency. The compromised response might be due to rampant decline of July precipitation in 2000-10, compared to previous decades. Although the July precipitation continued to decline in 2010-20, S. occidentalis showed signs of recovery, after generations of climate adaptation. I further evaluated their breeding niche competition, reflected by the overlap of breeding occupancy between species. I found that the competition potential was the lowest in 2000-10 when both species were at the trough of breeding occupancy, which recovered in 2010-20.

Data on protein-protein or pairwise interactions (PPI) typically come from a combination of sample separation and mass spectrometry. Since 2010, several extensive, high-throughput mass spectrometry-based experimental studies have dramatically expanded public repositories for PPI data and, by extension, our knowledge of protein complexes. Unfortunately, challenges of limited overlap between experiments, modality-oriented biases, and prohibitive costs of experimental reproducibility continue to limit coverage of the human protein assembly map, both underscoring the need for and spurring the development of relevant computational approaches.

Here, we present a new method for predicting the strength of protein interactions. It addresses two important issues that have limited past PPI prediction approaches: incomplete feature sets and incomplete proteome coverage. For a given collection of protein pairs, we fused data from heterogeneous sources into a feature matrix and identified the minimal set of feature partitions for which a non-empty set of protein pairs had complete values. For each such feature partition, we trained a classifier to predict PPI probabilities. We then calculated an overall prediction for a given protein pair by weighting the probabilities from all models that applied to that pair. Our approach accurately identified known and highly probable PPI, far exceeding the performance of current approaches and providing more complete proteome coverage. We then used the predicted probabilities to assemble complexes using previously-described graph-based tools and clustering algorithms and again obtained improved results. Lastly, we used features for three human cell lines to predict PPI and complex scores and identified complexes predicted to differ between those cell lines.",NA,biorxiv

For these reasons, this study aims to investigate the use of hTERT immortalized ( telomerized) MSCs as a potential source for efficient, standardized, reliable MSC-EVs production by comparing parental primary to their telomerized MSC counterparts. We observed that hTERT expression does not affect cell morphology or cellular doubling time, while ensuring unlimited, stable in vitro propagation. In addition, telomerized WJ-MSCs maintained the canonical expression profile of surface markers and the tri-lineage differentiation potential of their primary counterparts. In terms of EV characteristics, the immortalization by hTERT expression did not affect size, number, cargo composition or biological activity regarding anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and wound healing properties in vitro. In summary, the use of hTERT to immortalize MSCs leads to the creation of cell lines that continuously produce MSC-EVs without altering any key functionalities of the cells or resulting EVs. This suggests that telomerization of human cells from single donors is a promising strategy for generating cell factories that can produce EVs in standardized conditions and at scale and with standardization.",NA,biorxiv

In Azotobacter vinelandii and many other members of Proteobacteria, the two-component system NifL-NifA controls the expression of nif genes that encode the nitrogen fixation machinery. The NifL-NifA system evolved the ability to integrate several environmental cues, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon availability. The nitrogen fixation machinery is thereby only activated under strictly favorable conditions, enabling diazotrophs to thrive in competitive environments. Whilst genetic and biochemical studies have enlightened our understanding of how NifL represses NifA, the molecular basis of NifA sequestration by NifL depends on structural information on their interaction. Here, we present mechanistic insights into how nitrogen fixation is regulated by combining biochemical and genetic approaches with a low-resolution cryo-EM map of the oxidized NifL-NifA complex.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of expression, copy number variations, mutations, data from TCGA NSCLC patients to elucidate the genetic mechanism regulating MRPs in NSCLC. Consequently, we identified MRPL47, a significantly amplified and overexpressed mitoribosomal gene. We also found significant correlation of MRPL47 expression and copy number with patients survival. Functionally, we showed that inhibition of MRPL47 was associated with reduced cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, silencing MRPL47 impaired the enzymatic activity of electron chain complex I & III leading to a defective OXPHOS system and elevated mitochondrial ROS level. Further, we showed ROS-mediated increase in CDKN1A through the p38 MAPK pathway. The increased CDKN1A level induced G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting E2F activity. RNA sequencing analysis further confirmed that MRPL47 hinders cell growth by inhibiting E2F pathway. Additionally, we found that MRPL47 selectively regulates mitochondrial translation of specific OXPHOS proteins rather than influencing all mitochondrial proteins. Altogether, these findings suggest that MARPL47, is amplified and overexpressed in NSCLC and plays a critical role in tumor progression by regulating ROS signaling pathways.",NA,biorxiv

Importantly, the acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid whose increasing acidity selects out acetic acid bacteria with lower tolerances for acidity. The remaining acetic acid bacteria continue to produce higher levels of acidity causing a directional selection that drives the acidity tolerance of the overall population higher while reducing the population's genetic diversity.

The molecular mechanisms underlying structural circuit plasticity and how plasticity modifies behaviour, are poorly understood. Subjective experience requires dopamine, a neuromodulator that assigns a value to stimuli, and it also controls behaviour, including locomotion, learning and memory. In Drosophila, Toll receptors are ideally placed to translate experience into structural brain change. Toll-6 is expressed in dopaminergic neurons (DANs), raising the intriguing possibility that Toll-6 could regulate structural plasticity in dopaminergic circuits. Drosophila neurotrophin-2 (DNT-2) is the ligand for Toll-6 and Kek-6, but whether it is required for circuit structural plasticity was unknown. Here, we show that DNT-2 expressing neurons connect with DANs, and they modulate each other. Loss of function for DNT-2 or its receptors Toll-6 and kinase-less Trk-like kek-6 caused DAN and synapse loss, impaired dendrite growth and connectivity, decreased synaptic sites and caused locomotion deficits. By contrast, over-expressed DNT-2 increased DAN cell number, dendrite complexity and promoted synaptogenesis. Neuronal activity modified DNT-2, it increased synaptogenesis in DNT-2-positive neurons and DANs, and over-expression of DNT-2 did too. Altering the levels of DNT-2 or Toll-6 also modified dopamine-dependent behaviours, including locomotion and long-term memory. To conclude, a feedback loop involving dopamine and DNT-2 sculpted the circuits engaged, and DNT-2 with Toll-6 and Kek-6 induced structural plasticity in this circuit modifying brain function and behaviour.",NA,biorxiv

Through screening a kinome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA library we identified MAP3K7 (TAK1) as a suppressor of CD8+ T cell mediated killing. We demonstrate that TAK1 acts as a cancer-intrinsic checkpoint by integrating signals from T cell-secreted TNF and IFNy effector cytokines to elicit a cytoprotective response. This cytoprotective response profoundly limits the anti-cancer activity these key effector molecules and completely abrogates bystander killing by perforin deficient T cells. Inhibition of the TAK1 checkpoint effectively redirects the combined TNF/IFNy pathway activation to promote inflammatory cell death via RIPK1 and Caspase-8 and simultaneously amplifies the output of the IFNy pathway, thereby priming cells for cytokine-induced cell death. Mechanistically, TAK1 deficiency led to proteasomal degradation of cFLIP, enhancing the formation of Complex II and subversion of other cytoprotective responses. Targeting the TAK1 checkpoint led to profound attenuation of tumour growth in immune competent mice, with minimal impact in immune deficient counterparts. Adoptive cell therapy led to preferential elimination of TAK1 deficient clones. Collectively, our study uncovers a cancer-intrinsic checkpoint controlled by TAK1 activity that switches TNF and IFNy responses from cytoprotective to apoptosis. Cancer cells exploit this to limit cell death in the presence of the cytotoxic lymphoctye cytokines TNF and IFN{gamma} and therapeutic intervention can fully unleash the impact of these effector molecules both on the direct target and bystander cells. These findings highlight the clinical development of TAK1 biologics as a potential strategy to improve cancer immunotherapies through harnessing and enhancing the cytotoxic potential of CTL-derived cytokines.

In BriefDjajawi et al. identify TAK1 as a cancer-intrinsic cytokine toxicity checkpoint that limits the efficacy of anti-cancer immune responses. Cancer cells exploit TAK1 activity to confers resistance to CD8+ T cell-derived TNF and IFN{gamma}-induced apoptosis, limiting both direct and bystander killing. Mechanistically, TAK1 loss acts through 1. cFLIP and RIPK1 to promote cell death, 2. The inactivation of pro-survival signals and 3. Via amplification of the IFNy response. Targeting of this TAK1 checkpoint enhanced anti-tumour immunity in vivo and improved adoptive cellular therapy. These findings identify a strategy employed by transformed cells to avoid destruction by inflammatory cytokines and provide new therapeutic vulnerabilities for enhancing immunotherapies.

While most studies on inhibition focus on GABA, the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the brain, glutamate, can also elicit inhibition via metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The function of mGluR-mediated inhibition remains largely elusive. Here, we investigated the role of group III mGluR-dependent inhibition in the habenula. This primarily glutamatergic and conserved forebrain region acts as a hub between multiple forebrain inputs and neuromodulatory mid- and hindbrain targets that regulate adaptive behaviors. We showed that both zebrafish and mice habenula express group III mGluRs. We identified that group III mGluRs regulate the membrane potential and calcium activity of zebrafish dorsal habenula. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of group III mGluRs increased sensory-evoked excitation and reduced selectivity of habenular neurons to different sensory modalities. We also observed that inhibition is the main channel of communication between primarily glutamatergic habenula neurons. Blocking group III mGluRs reduced inhibition within habenula and increased correlations during spontaneous activity. In line with such inhibition within habenula, we identified that multi-sensory information is integrated mainly through competition and suppression across habenular neurons, which in part relies on group III mGluRs. Finally, genetic perturbation of a habenula-specific group III mGluR, mGluR6a, amplified neural responses and defensive behaviors evoked by sensory stimulation and environmental changes. Altogether, our results revealed that mGluR driven inhibition is essential in encoding, integration, and communication of information between Hb neurons, ultimately playing a critical role in regulating defensive and adaptive behaviors.",NA,biorxiv

Both the microbiota and the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium have a role in pharmacokinetic variability of medical drugs. In this study, we developed a high-throughput workflow to assess the absorption of bacterially produced (drug) metabolites by intestinal epithelial cells through the combination of anaerobic bacterial cultures and human-intestine derived Caco2 cell cultures in a transwell system. To functionally monitor the barrier integrity during the experiments, we introduced a panel of marker compounds, whose concentration kinetics on either side of the epithelial monolayer indicates barrier integrity and transport. We employed this workflow to systematically probe the effect of different gut bacterial species on the epithelial absorption of 482 drugs and their 172 bacterially produced metabolites. While we could recapitulate known bacterial drug biotransformation reactions and expected drug metabolite absorption profiles, we also identified 33 new bacteria-drug pairs for which bacterial biotransformation alters epithelial permeability. Further, we combined the developed experimental workflow with untargeted metabolomics analysis to systematically study epithelial permeability of metabolites naturally produced by gut bacteria. Tracking the absorption kinetics of 397 bacterially produced metabolites revealed that the majority (>79%) of these metabolites do not pass the Caco2 monolayer, illustrating its role as a physical and metabolic barrier. In summary, we present a highly adaptable high-throughput workflow to quantitatively study the metabolic interactions at the intestinal microbiota-host interface which can impact pharmacokinetics, toxicokinetics, and human physiology.",NA,biorxiv

As functional genomic (FG) datasets and assay types continue to expand, it is critical to establish scalable algorithms that can integrate thousands of diverse cell type-specific FG annotations with GWAS results.

ResultsWe propose BTS (Bayesian Tissue Score), a novel, highly efficient algorithm for 1) identification of affected cell types and functional genomic elements (context-mapping) and 2) cell type-specific inference of potentially causal variants (context-specific variant fine-mapping) using large-scale collections of heterogenous cell type-specific FG annotation tracks. To do so, BTS uses GWAS summary statistics and estimates per-annotation Bayesian models using genome-wide annotation tracks including enhancer, open chromatin, and epigenetic histone marks from the FILER FG database. We evaluated BTS across >900 FG annotation tracks on GWAS summary statistics for immune-related and cardiovascular traits, including Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Our results show that BTS scales well and is >100x more efficient when estimating functional annotation effects and performing context-specific variant fine-mapping compared to existing methods. Importantly, the resulting large-scale Bayesian evaluation and prioritization of both known and novel annotations, cell types, genomic regions, and variants provides biological insights into the functional contexts for these diseases.

Metagenomic studies have suggested that they are mixotrophic, capable of CO2 fixation and heterotrophic growth, and involved in acetogenesis and lignin degradation. We analysed 35 Bathyarchaeia metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), including the first complete circularized MAG (cMAG) of the Bathy-6 subgroup, from the metagenomes of three full scale pulp and paper mill anaerobic digesters and three laboratory methanogenic enrichment cultures maintained on pre-treated poplar. Thirty-three MAGs belong to the Bathy-6 lineage while two are from the Bathy-8 lineage. In our previous analysis of the microbial community in the pulp mill digesters, Bathyarchaeia were abundant and positively correlated to hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogenesis. Several factors likely contribute to the success of the Bathy-6 lineage compared to Bathy-8 in the reactors. The Bathy-6 genomes are larger than those of Bathy-8 and have more genes involved in lignocellulose degradation including carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) not present in the Bathy-8. Bathy-6 also share the Bathyarchaeal O-demethylase-system recently identified in Bathy-8. All the Bathy-6 MAGs had numerous membrane-associated pyrroloquinoline quinone-domain (PQQ) proteins that we suggest are involved in lignin modification or degradation, together with Radical-SAM and Rieske domain proteins, and AA2, AA3, and AA6-family oxidoreductases.

While social enrichment decreases lunging, aligning with past observations, it heightens the more forceful tussling behavior. These two forms of aggression rely on different olfactory receptor neurons, specifically Or67d for lunging and Or47b for tussling. We further identify three pairs of central pC1 neurons that specifically promote tussling.

This also affects photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism due to heat affected protein functions, enzyme activities and transport processes across membrane systems. In the present study, a combination of electrolyte leakage assays and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements was applied to quantify heat tolerance before and after heat acclimation of Arabidopsis thaliana at different temperature regimes. Subcellular carbohydrate concentrations were determined in a combined approach of non-aqueous fractionation and 3D reconstruction of mesophyll cells and subcellular compartments using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy. Across temperature regimes between 32 {degrees}C and 38 {degrees}C, 7 days heat acclimation at 34 {degrees}C was found to most efficiently increase tissue heat tolerance. Under such conditions, cytosolic sucrose concentrations were stabilised by a shift of sucrose cleavage rates into the vacuolar compartment while invertase-driven cytosolic sucrose cleavage was found to be efficiently quenched by fructose and glucose acting as competitive and non-competitive inhibitors, respectively.

The objective of this study is to computationally evaluate 53 phytochemicals that target the C-C chemokine receptor type-5 (CCR5) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type-4 (CXCR4) as potential anti-HIV medications. Effective anti-HIV medications were projected to be phytochemicals that may inhibit these receptors and so interfere with the HIV life cycle. AutoDock Vina was used to perform the molecular docking investigation from which six phytochemicals capable of inhibiting CCR5 and CXCR4 were identified based on the lowest docking score. The SWISSADME server was utilized to decide the druglikeness properties of these phytochemicals, the ADMETlab server to predict different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, the PASS-Way2Drug server to evaluate their activity spectra, and the RS-WebPredictor server to figure out the metabolism in the body. The six phytochemicals that were capable of suppressing CCR5 and CXCR4 were Withaferin A, Oleanolic Acid, Ursolic Acid, Theaflavine, Camptothecin, and Hypericin. The acceptable docking scores for these phytochemicals were less than -8.8 kcal/mol.

In general, resistance is expected to spread from highly impacted areas into surrounding environments as the spatial patterns of resistance reflect the balance between the ability of dispersal and horizontal gene transfer to spread resistance, and the effects of dilution or selection driven by other environmental or ecological factors that change along these gradients. However, the strength and scale of this effect is less clear, especially in coastal environments. We investigated antibiotic resistance of bacterial communities along a transect from a freshwater site in the Los Angeles River (surrounded by high-density urban development) out into the San Pedro Basin in the Pacific Ocean. We determined the minimum concentration of twelve different antibiotics needed to inhibit the growth of bacterial communities across eight sites. We also examined community composition and the prevalence of known genes related to antibiotic resistance from anthropogenic sources in each sample using 16S rRNA sequencing and qPCR. In contrast to our expectations, marine bacteria communities displayed higher resistance than the freshwater LA River community. Rather than the presence of known resistance genes or proximity to urban impacts, patterns of resistance were more strongly associated with the higher species diversity found in marine communities.

Characterizing intrinsic brain connectivity differences in older adults across a wide walking performance spectrum may provide insight into the mechanisms of functional decline in some older adults and resilience in others. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: (1) determine whether young adults and high- and low-functioning older adults show group differences in brain network segregation, and (2) determine whether network segregation is associated with working memory and walking function in these groups. The analysis included 21 young adults and 81 older adults. Older adults were further categorized according to their physical function using a standardized assessment; 54 older adults had low physical function while 27 were considered high functioning. Structural and functional resting state magnetic resonance images were collected using a Siemens Prisma 3T scanner. Working memory was assessed with the NIH Toolbox list sorting test. Walking speed was assessed with a 400 m-walk test at participants self-selected speed. We found that network segregation in mobility-related networks (sensorimotor, vestibular) was higher in older adults with higher physical function compared to older adults with lower physical function. There were no group differences in laterality effects on network segregation. We found multivariate associations between working memory and walking speed with network segregation scores. The interaction of left sensorimotor network segregation and age groups was associated with higher working memory function. Higher left sensorimotor, left vestibular, right anterior cingulate cortex, and interaction of left anterior cingulate cortex network segregation and age groups were associated with faster walking speed. These results are unique and significant because they demonstrate higher network segregation is largely related to higher physical function and not age alone.

The SWI has proved difficult to explain via traditional Bayesian models, which predict the opposite effect: expected weight from size (smaller = lighter) should be integrated with felt weight, such that the smaller object should be perceptually lighter. Other authors have proposed that weight and density are combined according to Bayesian principles, or that Bayesian models incorporating efficient coding can predict the SWI via  likelihood repulsion. These models, however, have been evaluated only under the narrow conditions of typical SWI stimuli. Here we establish a general model of perceived weight for pairs of objects that differ in weight and / or density and / or size by varying amounts. In a visuo-haptic task, participants (N = 30) grasped and lifted pairs of cubes, and reported their perceived heaviness. We report that the SWI occurs even at very small density differences, repudiating the idea that the illusion requires a significant conflict between expected and felt weight. Across all object pairs, perceived weight was well explained by a model (R2 = .98) that includes a positive influence of both objects weights and the judged objects density, but a negative influence of the other objects density. Critically, the influence of both densities on perceived weight is strongly modulated by weight difference, being three times as large for zero / small weight differences than large differences. Thus, it is only under the unusual conditions of typical SWI studies that we confuse weight with density to a substantial extent. Unlike existing models, that are inconsistent with our more comprehensive dataset, our model provides a quantitative, accurate and generalised account of weight perception for pairs of objects across various weight and size conditions.

Author summaryKnowing how heavy an object is allows us to grasp and lift it efficiently and without mishaps. Surprisingly, humans make systematic errors when judging the weight of objects of different size. For example, when two objects differ in size but have identical weight, the smaller object feels heavier. This is the  size-weight illusion. The illusion is strong and reliable and occurs even when we know that the two objects actually have the same weight. The size-weight illusion demonstrates that the human perceptual system doesnt work like a weighing scale, but instead takes into account other object features such as size or density, alongside weight. In this paper, we present a model that allows us to predict perceived weight in the size-weight illusion and across a wide range of objects of different weight / size / density, where previous models have failed.",NA,biorxiv

Thus, it is not surprising that many pathogens can perturb host sphingolipid homeostasis, often to promote pathogenesis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common opportunistic pathogen that, among many virulence factors, secretes the dual-functioning hemolytic phospholipase C/sphingomyelinase, PlcH. PlcH contributes to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis in several ways and plcH mutants are defective in nearly every infection model, wherein PlcH has been shown to hydrolyze both phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, resulting in inflammation and rupture of host cell membranes. Here, we demonstrate that PlcH can also hydrolyze sphingosylphosphocholine (SPC, also known as lysosphingomyelin), an important host signaling sphingolipid responsible for regulating cellular and tissue responses such as inflammation and endothelial barrier function. PlcH hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to generate phosphocholine and ceramide, and analogously, here we demonstrate that PlcH hydrolyzes SPC to sphingosine and putatively, phosphocholine. We provide evidence that SPC induction of PlcH is primarily regulated by the sphingosine-responsive SphR regulator and that resultant sphingosine liberated from SPC induces transcription from the other genes in the SphR regulon. This work introduces another way that P. aeruginosa can alter the host sphingolipidome, potentially a different mechanism to promote pathogenesis. The capacity for the hemolytic Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin to also cleave SPC suggests that SPC may be a common substrate for phosphocholine-specific phospholipases C.

ImportancePlcH is a secreted phospholipase C/sphingomyelinase that is important for the virulence of P. aeruginosa. Here we show that both P. aeruginosa PlcH and C. perfringens alpha toxin can hydrolyze the signaling phospholipid sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), also called lysosphingomyelin. Thus, SPC should be considered a potential target for such phospholipases during infection whose resulting hydrolysis can induce sphingosine-sensitive genes.",NA,biorxiv

Understanding the process by which healthy cells become senescent and develop SASP factors is critical for improving the identification of senescent cells and, ultimately, understanding tissue dysfunction. Here, we reveal how the duration of cellular stress modulates the SASP in distinct subpopulations of senescent cells. We used multiplex, single-cell imaging to build a proteomic map of senescence induction in human epithelial cells induced to senescence over the course of 31 days. We map how the expression of SASP proteins increases alongside other known senescence markers such as p53, p21, and p16INK4a. The aggregated population of cells responded to etoposide with an accumulation of stress response factors over the first 11 days, followed by a plateau in most proteins. At the single-cell level, however, we identified two distinct senescence cell populations, one defined primarily by larger nuclear area and the second by higher protein concentrations. Trajectory inference suggested that cells took one of two discrete molecular paths from unperturbed healthy cells, through a common transitional subpopulation, and ending at the discrete terminal senescence phenotypes. Our results underscore the importance of using single-cell proteomics to identify the mechanistic pathways governing the transition from senescence induction to a mature state of senescence characterized by the SASP.",NA,biorxiv

High extracellular K+ suppresses T cell function by negatively regulating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. In contrast, elevated extracellular Na+ enhances T cell effector function by boosting the phosphorylation of TCR signaling modules. Here, we presented a mechanism explaining how the two monovalent cations differently regulate TCR function. At rest, high intracellular K+ uncouples allosteric recruitment of ZAP-70, a key signaling module, to the TCR complex. The formation of antigen TCR complex induces K+ efflux, causing spontaneous recruitment of ZAP-70 to the TCR. Increasing extracellular K+ perturbs K+ efflux and slows ZAP-70 recruitment to the TCR complex, even upon antigen binding. This leads to defects in T cell development and arthritis-like symptoms in juvenile mice. We conclude that K+ dynamics is integral to T cell ligand discrimination and fundamental to turning off the signaling during T cell quiescence.",NA,biorxiv

Identifying spatial domains within tissues is essential for understanding tissue architecture and the mechanisms underlying various biological processes, including development and disease progression. Here, we present Randomized Spatial PCA (RASP), a novel spatially aware dimensionality reduction method for spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. RASP is designed to be orders-of-magnitude faster than existing techniques, scale to ST data with hundreds-of-thousands of locations, support the flexible integration of non-transcriptomic covariates, and enable the reconstruction of de-noised and spatially smoothed expression values for individual genes. To achieve these goals, RASP uses a randomized two-stage principal component analysis (PCA) framework that leverages sparse matrix operations and configurable spatial smoothing. We compared the performance of RASP against five alternative methods (BASS, GraphST, SEDR, spatialPCA, and STAGATE) on four publicly available ST datasets generated using diverse techniques and resolutions (10x Visium, Stereo-Seq, MERFISH, and 10x Xenium) on human and mouse tissues. Our results demonstrate that RASP achieves tissue domain detection performance comparable or superior to existing methods with a several orders-of-magnitude improvement in computational speed.

To estimate both the slope and offset parameters of the relationship between shear wave speed and muscle force, it is necessary to collect measurements in a plethora of postures in case of substantial muscle redundancy. However, anisotropic MRE requires a structural and diffusion-tensor imaging scan in each posture, which is infeasible given the time constraints of MRI imaging.

The objectives of this work were to develop a muscle force estimator with sufficient accuracy that would only require a limited set of postures, and to evaluate its effectiveness under a variety of measurement conditions. We developed a novel MRE-based muscle force estimator, which decouples shear wave speed into its active and passive components and solves for the slope and offset parameters, independently. We assessed the effectiveness of the proposed estimator under different simulated measurement conditions, with varying levels of noise, and compared it to the original MRE-based estimator.

The proposed estimator results in a reduction in the estimation error for the offset parameter, for all muscles, without significant degradation in the estimation error for the slope parameter. However, the proposed muscle force estimator does not improve the goodness-of-fit or the cross-validation error compared to the original estimator. In conclusion, the proposed MRE-based muscle force estimator improves the estimation of muscle-specific parameters and may yield increased muscle force estimation performance.",NA,biorxiv

In contrast to human APC/C in which coactivator induces a conformational change of the catalytic module APC2:APC11 to allow E2 binding, in S. cerevisiae apo-APC/C the catalytic module is already positioned to bind E2. Furthermore, we find no evidence of a phospho-regulatable auto-inhibitory segment of APC1, that in the unphosphorylated human APC/C, sterically blocks the CDC20C-box binding site of APC8.

Moreover, despite the growing application of deep learning in various biomedical fields, its application in integrating networks to analyze disease mechanisms in AD research remains limited. In this study, we employed BIONIC, a deep learning-based network integration method, to integrate proteomics and protein-protein interaction data, with an aim to uncover factors that moderate the effects of the A{beta}-tau interaction on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage AD.

MethodsProteomic data from the ROSMAP cohort were integrated with protein-protein interaction (PPI) data using a Deep Learning-based model. Linear regression analysis was applied to histopathological and gene expression data, and mutual information was used to detect moderating factors. Statistical significance was determined using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (p < 0.05).

ResultsOur results suggested that astrocytes and GPNMB+ microglia moderate the A{beta}-tau interaction. Based on linear regression with histopathological and gene expression data, GFAP and IBA1 levels and GPNMB gene expression positively contributed to the interaction of tau with A{beta} in non-dementia cases, replicating the results of the network analysis.

Here, we leveraged the well-documented acoustic repertoire of the bat species Carollia perspicillata to study adaptation in the bat brain using natural communication sounds. We searched for SSA in single neuron spiking activity measured in two brain areas simultaneously: the auditory cortex and the frontal auditory field. The stimuli consisted of natural distress syllables, a form of vocalization produced by bats under duress. Bat distress vocalizations signal different degrees of urgency based on their amplitude modulation pattern, without large differences in their spectral structure. These distress vocalizations make an ideal test case for exploring the limits of neural deviance detection when considering naturalistic soundscapes with low stimulus contrast. The results show limited evidence for stimulus-specific adaptation in response to natural sound sequences in the majority of neurons studied. Many neurons did show a prominent effect related to context-dependent changes, caused by the type of sounds that occurred most frequently within each oddball sequence. Context-dependent responses were strongest in frontal neurons. Decoding analysis showed the existence of neural populations in both frontal and auditory cortices, which could distinguish between deviants and standards occurring within the same sequence, without large changes in evoked spike counts.

However, the mechanisms governing transcription fidelity remain incompletely understood. While previous studies have characterized how error rates vary with nucleotide identity at upstream and downstream positions from the incorporation site, the comprehensive microscopic explanation of this sequence dependence has not been elucidated. In this study, we develop a novel theoretical approach that integrates transcription proofreading mechanisms and inhomogenous DNA sequence effects. Using first-passage analysis validated by Monte Carlo simulations, we quantitatively characterize nucleotide-specific error rates during RNA polymerase II transcription. The model accurately reproduces experimental error rates and predicts kinetic parameters influencing transcriptional fidelity. Analysis reveals nucleotide incorporation rates follow the hierarchy U<C<G<A, consistent with independent experimental observations. Notably, our model not only explains how the error rates depend on the nature of the base immediately down-stream (+1) but also predicts that the identity of the nucleotide at the second downstream position (+2) also plays an important role. Pyrimidines at position +2 contribute to lower error rates than purines, whereas the third downstream base (+3) has no effect. These previously unreported correlations are corroborated by bioinformatic analysis of existing datasets. In addition, using the BRCA1 gene as an example, we explore the physiological implications of sequence-dependent error rates, identifying an increased likelihood of premature stop codon errors.

Here, we carried out unbiased and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of the TM domain dimers of the wild-type p75, TrkA and TrkB NT receptors and selected mutants in micelle and bilayer lipid environments at atomistic and coarse-grained levels of representation. The coarse-grained simulations enabled exploration of multiple states of the TM domain dimers and revealed the influence of the lipid environment on the TM helix arrangements. From the simulations, we identify active and inactive TM helix arrangements of the p75 and TrkA receptors that are supported by experimental data and suggest two different signaling mechanisms through the C-terminal regions of the TM helices. For TrkB, a single dominant but less energetically stable arrangement of the TM domain dimer is observed. These findings have implications for mechanistic studies of NT receptor signaling and the design of neuroprotective drugs to stabilize specific states of the TM domain of the receptors.

Significance StatementNeurotrophins regulate neuronal survival, growth and differentiation during development, and play a role in many neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. They initiate signaling through the cell membrane by associating extracellularly with transmembrane receptors. The transmembrane helical domain of the neurotrophin receptors is responsible for transmitting the activation signal to the cell interior. However, how the transmembrane domain mediates signal transmission and the relation between its sequence and signaling mechanism remain unclear. Here, by employing state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulation techniques, we identify active and inactive states of the transmembrane domains of the three main neurotrophin receptors that support distinct transmembrane signaling mechanisms for these receptors. Our results have implications for mechanistic studies of neurotrophin signaling and the design of neuroprotective drugs.",NA,biorxiv

Somatic pathogenetic variants in cohesin genes, such as STAG2, have been associated with cancer, but their contribution to brain tumorigenesis is unclear. Here, we report the presence of STAG2 variants in glioblastoma and medulloblastoma patients and determine that loss of STAG2 in human cells leads to DNA damage and apoptosis. Treatment with inhibitors of the Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), which are used to treat forms of cancer with defects in DNA repair, increased the amount of apoptosis, confirming that synthetic lethality between reduced cohesin and PARP activity could be observed in vitro. Similar results were obtained in vivo by reducing expression of SA1, the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of STAG1/2. Cohesin gene silencing during fly brain development leads to defects in neural stem cells differentiation and tumorigenesis both in the presence of oncogenic activity and per se. Our in vivo and in vitro data suggests that impairment of PARP activity might induce synthetic lethality in cohesin-dependent tumors, highlighting a vulnerability that can be pharmacologically exploited.",NA,biorxiv

However, integrating and comparing data across studies and cohorts remains challenging due to variability in device types, acquisition protocols, and preprocessing methods. A key challenge is removing unwanted study- or device-specific effects while preserving meaningful biological signals. These difficulties are exacerbated by the longitudinal and within-day correlations inherent in high-resolution time series data collected from wearable sensors. To address this, we propose INTACT (INtegration of Time series data from weArable sensors for physiCal acTivity), a novel method for harmonizing physical activity intensity time series from accelerometers. INTACT models shared information through common eigenvalues and eigenfunctions while allowing for domain-specific scale and rotation adjustments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of INTACT on two cohorts from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), where physical activity measures were collected using different generations of accelerometers and processed into different units. Our results show that INTACT outperforms existing methods in mitigating domain effects while preserving biological signals, enabling more reliable cross-study comparisons of physical activity patterns.",NA,biorxiv

Epistasis increases landscape complexity, often resulting in multiple fitness peaks. In its simplest form, known as global epistasis, fitness is modeled as a non-linear function of an underlying additive trait. In contrast, more complex epistasis arises from a network of (pairwise or many-body) interactions between residues, which cannot be removed by a single non-linear transformation. Recent studies have explored how global and network epistasis contribute to the emergence of functional bottlenecks - fitness landscape topologies where two broad high-fitness basins, representing distinct phenotypes, are separated by a bottleneck that can only be crossed via one or a few mutational paths. Here, we introduce and analyze a simple model of global epistasis with an additive underlying trait. We demonstrate that functional bottlenecks arise with high probability if the model is properly calibrated. Our results underscore the necessity of sufficient heterogeneity in the mutational effects selected by evolution for the emergence of functional bottlenecks. Moreover, we show that the model agrees with experimental findings, at least in small enough combinatorial mutational spaces.",NA,biorxiv

In this study, we aimed to improve our MG reprogramming strategy in a more intact retinal environment. For this purpose, we used an in vitro culture system of human fetal retinal tissue and adult human postmortem retina. To stimulate reprogramming, we used lentiviral vectors to deliver constructs with a glial-specific promoter (HES1) driving ASCL1 alone or in combination with additional developmental transcription factors such as ATOH1 and NEUROD1. Combining IHC, scRNA-seq and electrophysiology, we show for the first time that human MG can generate new neurons even in adults.

However, few studies explore the decomposition of trait-environment relationships in a rigorous phylogenetic framework. Combining a revised phylogeny with trait, climate and soil data to achieve unprecedented species coverage ([~]85%), we identified patterns of replicated evolution that allowed the evergreen tree genus, Eucalyptus, to rapidly radiate across Australia in response to aridification. Eucalypts from arid regions are short, produce dense wood, and have small, physically robust leaves with high nitrogen content, promoting hydraulic safety and economies in photosynthetic water use. Phylogenetic modelling reveals strong niche conservatism, with adaptation to aridity occurring primarily via clade-level divergences, followed by phylogenetically independent adjustments to local conditions. Ancestral state reconstructions accounting for trends in the paleoclimate record indicate that transitions in aridity tolerance are associated with distinct signals of environmental filtering and directional selection on functional trait variation. However, astonishing repeatability of trait changes in different clades reveals a narrow optimal solution to water availability, opening a path to predict future species distributions from phylogenetically structured trait data and signalling major implications for functional and species diversity under progressive climate change.",NA,biorxiv

Here we report on an innovative use of high-throughput sequencing technology combined with rapid experimental evolution that allowed us to follow the genetic diversification of four independent bacteriophage populations that we evolved without imposing any direct selection pressure for 412 generations in unprecedented detail. Tracing over 80000 bacteriophage genomes, of which 884 are unique, we find that evolution is largely neutral but document multiple instances of parallel evolution. Unlike previous observations of parallelism, we do not just see the parallel evolution of mutations at single sites, but on the level of full-length genomes. Computer simulations that recapitulate our experiments in great detail show that this degree of paralellism is inconsistent with neutral evolution. We further show that the observed extent of parallel evolution biases phylodynamic analysis of migration rates, and wrongly estimates significant migration between the independent evolution lines. Our approach is applicable to many other viruses and paves the way to advanced population genetic investigations that aim to shed light on phenomena that relate to genetic linkage across the genome.

Significance StatementGenetic sequences of organisms contain imprints of their population biology and migration history. To recover this history, phylodynamic inference has been developed that combines phylogenetics with population biological models. Although phylodynamic methods are being applied widely, they have not yet been experimentally validated. To do this, we evolved a bacteriophage in four independent evolution lines for over 400 generations. We did not impose any direct selection pressure in these evolution experiments because phylodynamic inference works best in neutrally evolving systems. We found that often the same mutations and combinations of mutations evolve in the independent evolution lines. As a result, phylodynamics wrongly estimates migration between the lines. We conclude that the effects of selection should be included into phylodynamic inference.",NA,biorxiv

The deep superior colliculus (dSC) integrates input from several brain regions that influence the selection of targets for orienting movements and coordinates activity among brainstem motor nuclei to initiate and execute movement. Evidence suggests that one prominent dSC input, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), permits movement by disinhibiting its targets, but much is unknown about the relationship between SNr activity, dSC activity, and movement. Building on increasing application of the head-fixed mouse model to elucidate the neural basis of behavior, we examined neural activity recorded in dSC and SNr with high-density probes in mice performing several variants of a sensorimotor orienting task, from our labs and in data sets curated by the International Brain Laboratory. We found that dSC and SNr were active preceding and throughout movement, across task variants, suggesting that they were engaged by the required movements. Prior to movement, SNr activity reflected the outcome of the previous trial, consistent with a role in biasing movements towards the highest value target. However, the dependence of dSC activity on movement direction was weaker than in other directional orienting behaviors, and we found little evidence for strong suppression of dSC by SNr. These results complement and extend previous findings from other orienting tasks and suggest diverse roles for modulatory input from SNr to dSC in shaping motor behavior.",NA,biorxiv

Subjects viewed natural scenes while their gaze patterns were recorded and analyzed in relation to normative computational saliency maps generated using a deep learning model of visual attention.

Here, we show that in 3D reaching in VR, ataxia preserves the visuomotor feedforward and feedback control structure compared to the control group. However, the ataxia group exhibits a small increase in feedback delay (~ 20 ms) and a substantial increase in feedforward delay (~ 70 ms) together with a reduced feedback gain (~25 % lower). Our results suggest that the feedforward and feedback pathways remain largely intact in ataxia, but that time delay deficits and temoral discoordination amongst these control pathways may contribute to the disorder. We also find that providing a preview--analogous to driving on a clear night and seeing the road ahead vs. driving in the fog-- improves tracking performance in the ataxia group, although the control group was significantly better able to exploit this preview information.

In Schizossacharomyces pombe, the STUbL Slx8 is a regulator of SUMOylated proteins and promotes replication stress tolerance by counteracting the toxicity of SUMO conjugates. In order to study the dynamic dialectic between Ubiquitinylation and SUMOylation in the nuclear space of the S. pombe genome, we analyzed Slx8 localization.

However, we discovered that Slx8 forms a single nuclear focus, enriched at the nuclear periphery, which marks both clustered centromeres at the spindle pole body and the silent mating type region. The formation of this single Slx8 focus requires the E3 SUMO ligase Pli1, poly-SUMOylation and the histone methyl transferase Clr4 that is responsible for the heterochromatin histone mark H3-K9 methylation.

The striatum is comprised largely of GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that are defined by their long-range efferents. Direct SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal globus pallidus/substantia nigra reticulata whereas indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external pallidum; the concerted activity of both SPN subtypes modulates movement. Convergent results from genetic, imaging and physiological studies in patients suggest that abnormalities of both dSPNs and iSPNs contribute to the expression of dystonia, but the molecular adaptations underlying these abnormalities are not known. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of SPN cell-type-specific molecular signatures in a model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD mice), which is caused by gene defects that reduce dopamine neurotransmission, resulting in dystonia that is specifically associated with striatal dysfunction. Individually profiling the translatome of dSPNs and iSPNs using translating ribosome affinity purification with RNA-seq revealed hundreds of differentially translating mRNAs in each SPN subtype in DRD mice, yet there was little overlap between the dysregulated genes in dSPNs and iSPNs. Despite the paucity of shared adaptations, a disruption in glutamatergic signaling was predicted for both dSPNs and iSPNs. Indeed, we found that both AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated currents were enhanced in dSPNs but diminished in iSPNs in DRD mice. The pattern of mRNA dysregulation was specific to dystonia as the adaptations in DRD mice were distinct from those in parkinsonian mice where the dopamine deficit occurs in adults, suggesting that the phenotypic outcome is dependent on both the timing of the dopaminergic deficit and the SPN-specific adaptions. We leveraged the unique molecular signatures of dSPNs and iSPNs in DRD mice to identify biochemical mechanisms that may be targets for therapeutics, including LRRK2 inhibition.

Recent complexities have arisen in SNX9s lipid specificity and its involvement both endocytic and filopodial membrane topologies. Here we use biolayer interferometry, cell-free reconstitution and superresolution microscopy to analyse the activities of SNX9. We find that more SNX9 binds membranes that contain PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3)P compared with PI(3,4)P2, despite having similar affinity, suggesting SNX9 can assemble into different macromolecular arrangements depending on the composition. Actin assembly requires the wider protein and lipid network provided by PX-BAR and SH3 interactions. 3D direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy on filopodia-like reconstitutions shows that SNX9 and related protein Transducer of Cdc42 activation-1 (TOCA-1) are competent to form both tubular and plaque-like organizations with the actin machinery. Finally, using cryo-electron tomography we show that SNX9 assembles both branched and bundled actin filaments demonstrating its multifunctional nature.",NA,biorxiv

Although mTECs undergo turnover in adults, the molecular mechanisms behind this process remain unclear. This study describes the direct and indirect roles of receptor activator of NF-{kappa}B ligand (RANKL) and CD40 ligand (CD40L) signaling in TECs in the adult thymus. Flow cytometric and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analyses suggest that the depletion of both RANKL and CD40L signaling inhibits mTEC differentiation from CCL21+ mTEC progenitors to transit-amplifying TECs in the adult thymus. Unexpectedly, this depletion also indirectly affects the gene expression of TEC progenitors and cortical TECs. Notably, AP-1 gene expression, which allows further subdivision of TEC progenitors, is upregulated following the depletion of RANKL and CD40L signaling. Overall, our data propose that RANKL and CD40L signaling cooperatively maintain mature mTEC frequency in the adult thymus and sustain the characteristics of TEC progenitors through an indirect mechanism.",NA,biorxiv

Soil microbial diversity is vital in supporting ecosystem multifunctionality and preventing pathogen growth. Recent studies have revealed that farming activities homogenize microbial communities across distant sites, which may lead to functional homogenization on that scale. However, given the redundancy of microbial functions, functional homogenization driven by farming may occur on a broader scale than taxonomic homogenization. We compared the taxonomic and functional compositions of soil prokaryotic and fungal communities between natural lands and farmlands at scales ranging from within-site ([~]200 m) to across-site ([~]1500 km) in Kenya and Malawi, using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS genes and the prediction of microbial functions. Soil microbial functional compositions were homogenized more broadly than taxonomic compositions in farmlands compared to natural lands, suggesting that similar functional responses to farming occur across scales where different taxa thrive. Furthermore, environmental factors predominantly influenced within-site homogeneity, whereas farming itself was a significant contributor to across-site homogeneity, indicating an overriding influence of farming compared to environmental variations. Additionally, pathogenic fungi were relatively more abundant in farmlands, likely due to reduced species competition and farming-induced environmental changes such as low soil pH. Our findings highlight the need to investigate microbial functional diversity alongside taxonomic diversity when assessing the impacts of land-use changes on soil health to develop sustainable land management strategies.",NA,biorxiv

How the gametophyte and sporophyte coordinate their development has long been of interest. However, the function of the inner integument in embryo sac development has remained elusive. Here, we addressed this question. We applied a genetic ablation strategy to achieve an early block in inner integument outgrowth. We generated plants expressing BARNASE under the control of an early acting endothelium-specific promoter. Corresponding lines carried ovules lacking most of the inner integument. The genetic and cell biological data revealed that in the near absence of an inner integument embryo sac development is blocked at the mono-nuclear embryo sac stage in most pre-fertilization ovules. Approximately 10 percent of the ovules developed a functional embryo sac and underwent fertilization. Subsequent embryo and endosperm development appeared unperturbed and viable seeds were produced albeit of altered shape. Our results show that the inner integument plays an important role in early embryo sac development as well as ovule and seed shape, but is dispensable for embryo and endosperm development.

The guanylhydrazone-based molecule, TCB-32, was identified via structure-based virtual screening on the orthosteric binding site of FGFR1. It was shown to significantly increase cell proliferation by activating the FGFR1 signalling pathway like bFGF and exhibited enhanced thermostability over bFGF by containing activity over the course of several days. After extensive structure-activity relationship studies it was possible to increase potency and efficacy leading to three highly potent agonists. This finding has the potential to remove current bottlenecks in large-scale cell production as required for applications like cultivated meat or cell therapy.

Although a simple heuristic model for vertical growth was experimentally shown to accurately describe the behavior of diverse microbial species, the biophysical implications and theoretical basis for this empirical model were unclear. Here, we demonstrate that this heuristic model emerges naturally from fundamental principles of active fluid dynamics. By analytically deriving exact solutions for an active fluid model of vertical biofilm growth, we show that the governing equations reduce to the same form as the empirical model in both early- and late-stage growth regimes. Our analysis reveals that cell death and decay rates likely play key roles in determining the characteristic parameters of vertical growth. The active fluid model produces a single, simple equation governing growth at heights above and below the diffusion limit; surprisingly, this ""full"" expression is simpler than the heuristic. With this theoretical basis, we explain why the vertical growth rate reaches a maximum at a height greater than the previously identified characteristic length scale. These results provide a theoretical foundation for a simple mathematical model of vertical growth, enabling deeper understanding of how biological and biophysical factors interact during biofilm development.",NA,biorxiv

Analysis of such datasets presents a significant challenge in accurately annotating cell types and their associated biomarkers. scRNA-seq datasets analysis will help us understand diseases such as Alzheimers, Cancer, Diabetes, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Systemic Lupus Ery-thematosus (SLE), etc. Recently different pipelines based on machine learning (ML) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) methods have been employed to tackle these issues utilizing scRNA-seq datasets. These pipelines have arisen as a promising resource and are capable of extracting meaningful and concise features from noisy, diverse, and high-dimensional data to enhance annotations and subsequent analysis. Existing tools require high computational resources to execute large sample datasets.

MethodsWe have developed a cutting-edge platform known as scaLR (Single Cell Analysis using Low Resource) that efficiently processes data in batches, and reduces the required resources for processing large datasets and running NN models. scaLR is equipped with data processing, feature extraction, training, evaluation, and downstream analysis. The data processing module consists of sample-wise & standard scaler normalization and splitting of data. Its novel feature extraction algorithm, first trains the model on a feature subset and stores feature importance for all the features in that subset. At the end of this process, top K features are selected based on their importance. The model is trained on top K features, its performance evaluation and associated downstream analysis provide significant biomarkers for different cell types and diseases/traits.

ResultsTo showcase the capabilities of scaLR, we utilized several scRNA-seq datasets of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs), Alzheimers patients, and large datasets from human and mouse embryonic development. Our findings indicate that scaLR offers comparable prediction accuracy and requires less model training time and compute resources than existing Python-based pipelines and frameworks. Moreover, scaLR efficiently handles large sample datasets (>11.4 million cells) with minimal resource usage (29GB RAM, 12GB GPU, and 8 CPUs) while maintaining high prediction accuracy and being capable of ranking the biomarker association with specific cell types and diseases.

While cooperative binding, relying on direct repressor-DNA binding, has been classically regarded as a key ultrasensitivity mechanism, recent theoretical works have demonstrated that combinations of indirect repression mechanisms--sequestration, blocking, and displacement--can also achieve ultrasensitive switches with greater robustness to transcriptional noise. However, these previous works have neglected key biological constraints such as DNA binding kinetics and the limited availability of transcriptional activators, raising the question of whether ultrasensitivity and noise robustness can be sustained under biologically realistic conditions. Here, we systematically assess the impact of these factors on ultrasensitivity and noise robustness under physiologically plausible conditions. We show that while various repression combinations can reduce noise, only the full combination of all three indirect mechanisms consistently maintains low noise and high ultrasensitivity. As a result, biological oscillators employing this triple repression architecture retain precise rhythmic switching even under high noise, and even when activators are shared across thousands of target genes. Our findings offer a mechanistic explanation for the frequent co-occurrence of these repression mechanisms in natural gene regulatory systems.

AUTHOR SUMMARYCells must make accurate decisions in noisy environments using limited molecular resources. One essential tool for this is the ultrasensitive transcriptional switch, which enables sharp transitions in gene expression. While cooperative binding has long been viewed as the primary mechanism behind ultrasensitivity, it is highly sensitive to molecular noise. Our study explores how cells overcome this limitation by combining three indirect repression mechanisms: sequestration, blocking, and displacement. We show that this triple-repression architecture not only generates ultrasensitivity but also ensures noise robustness under physiologically realistic conditions--even when a single pool of transcription factors regulates thousands of genes. These findings reveal a biologically feasible strategy for noise-resilient transcription and offer a mechanistic explanation for why these repression strategies frequently co-occur in natural systems.",NA,biorxiv

While commensal bacteria and their metabolites are known to modulate the host environment, contradictory effects and a lack of mechanistic understanding impede the translation of microbiome-based therapies into the clinic. In this study, we demonstrate that abundance of the commensal metabolite pentanoate is predictive for survival of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell patients in two independent cohorts. Its implementation in the CAR T cell manufacturing workflow overcomes solid tumor microenvironments in immunocompetent cancer models by hijacking the epigenetic-metabolic crosstalk, reducing exhaustion and promoting naive-like differentiation.

While synergy of clinically relevant drugs mimicked the phenotype of pentanoate-engineered CAR T cells in vitro, in vivo challenge showed inferior tumor control. Metabolic tracing of 13C-pentanoate revealed citrate generation in the TCA cycle via the acetyl- and succinyl-CoA entry points as a unique feature of the C5 aliphatic chain. Inhibition of the ATP-citrate lyase, which links metabolic output and histone acetylation, led to accumulation of pentanoate-derived citrate from the succinyl-CoA route and decreased functionality of SCFA-engineered CAR T cells. Our data demonstrate that microbial metabolites are incorporated as epigenetic imprints and implementation into CAR T cell production might serve as embodiment of the microbiome-host axis benefits for clinical applications.",NA,biorxiv

The reassembly of a nucleus after mitosis requires the reformation of the nuclear envelope around a single mass of chromosomes. This process requires Ankle2 (also known as LEM4 in humans) which interacts with PP2A and promotes the function of Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF). Upon dephosphorylation, BAF dimers cross-bridge chromosomes and bind lamins and transmembrane proteins of the reassembling nuclear envelope. How Ankle2 functions in mitosis is incompletely understood. Using a combination of approaches in Drosophila, along with structural modeling, we provide several lines of evidence that suggest that Ankle2 is a regulatory subunit of PP2A, explaining how it promotes BAF dephosphorylation. In addition, we discovered that Ankle2 interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum protein Vap33, which is required for Ankle2 localization at the reassembling nuclear envelope during telophase. We identified the interaction sites of PP2A and Vap33 on Ankle2. Through genetic rescue experiments, we show that the Ankle2/PP2A interaction is essential for the function of Ankle2 in nuclear reassembly and that the Ankle2/Vap33 interaction also promotes this process. Our study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms of post-mitotic nuclear reassembly and suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum is not merely a source of membranes in the process, but also provides localized enzymatic activity.",10.7554/elife.104233.3,biorxiv

The PET tracer [18F]3F4AP, a fluorinated derivative of the FDA-approved drug 4-aminopyridine, selectively binds to voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels, offering a novel approach to assess TBI-related node of Ranvier disruption and demyelination. This study evaluates [18F]3F4AP PET in penetrating and non-penetrating TBI models.

MethodsEither controlled cortical impact (CCI, penetrating) or concussive (non-penetrating) TBI models were used to induce TBI in mice. Dynamic PET imaging with [18F]3F4AP was performed at time points of 0, 3, 7, 14, and/or 31 days post-injury (dpi), with quantitative analyses comparing tracer uptake in injured versus control regions. Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining was conducted to evaluate histological myelin loss.

ResultsIn the CCI model, [18F]3F4AP PET imaging demonstrated a 34% increase in tracer uptake at the injury site at 7 dpi, correlating with histological evidence of demyelination. Tracer uptake gradually declined over time, reflecting potential remyelination. The concussive TBI model showed a smaller and more diffuse increase in uptake at 7 dpi compared to CCI.

Conclusion[18F]3F4AP PET imaging effectively detects demyelination following TBI, with very high sensitivity in penetrating injuries. These findings highlight the potential of [18F]3F4AP as a valuable imaging biomarker for assessing TBI progression and/or therapeutic response. Further studies are warranted to explore its clinical applicability and comparison with other imaging modalities.",NA,biorxiv

However, the factors driving this asymmetry remain poorly understood. We explored whether tau asymmetry is linked to i) reduced inter-hemispheric brain connectivity (potentially restricting tau spread), or ii) asymmetry in amyloid-beta (A{beta}) distribution (indicating greater hemisphere-specific vulnerability to AD pathology). 452 participants from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort with evidence of both A{beta} pathology (CSF A{beta}42/40 or neocortical A{beta}-PET) and tau pathology (temporal tau-PET), were categorised as left asymmetric (n=102), symmetric (n=306), or right asymmetric (n=44) based on temporal lobe tau-PET uptake distribution. Edge-wise inter-hemispheric functional (RSfMRI; n=318) and structural connectivity (dMRI; n=352) patterns were examined but no differences in inter-hemispheric functional or structural connectivity were found between groups. However, a strong association was observed between tau and A{beta} laterality patterns based on PET uptake (n=233; {beta}=0.632, p<0.001), which was replicated in three independent cohorts (n=234; {beta}=0.535, p<0.001). In a longitudinal A{beta}-positive sample, baseline A{beta} asymmetry predicted the progression of tau laterality over time (n=289; {beta}=0.025, p=0.028). These findings suggest that tau asymmetry is not associated with a weaker inter-hemispheric connectivity but might reflect hemispheric differences in vulnerability to A{beta} pathology, underscoring the role of regional vulnerability in determining the distribution of AD pathology.",NA,biorxiv

Whether lactate is a major fuel in cancer cells remains debated. This study investigated whether lactate could serve as a metabolic fuel in glioma cells and replace glucose to support viability.

MethodsA bioluminescence ATP assay and calcein-AM/EthD-III double-staining were used to measure ATP content and viability in mouse (VM-M3, CT-2A) and human (U-87MG) glioma cells differing in cell biology and genetic background. Viability was assessed in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TPMs) from VM/Dk and C57BL/6J mice, used as syngeneic non-neoplastic controls for VM-M3 and CT-2A gliomas, respectively. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was determined using the Resipher system.

ResultsLactate alone failed to sustain ATP content and viability in all glioma cell lines. ATP content and viability were lower in cancer cells cultured in glutamine and lactate than in glucose and glutamine. In contrast, lactate alone sustained over 45% viability in both TPM models. Moreover, viability was similar between TPMs cultured in glutamine and lactate and in glucose and glutamine. In human U-87MG, lactate addition under severe glucose restriction increased OCR and viability. A low dose of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose abolished both increases.

ConclusionsOur results suggest non-neoplastic mouse TPMs utilize lactate more effectively than mouse glioma cells. In U-87MG, lactate utilization appears glycolysis-dependent, given its sensitivity to 2-deoxy-D-glucose. In conclusion, our data does not support lactate as a major oxidative fuel for viability in mouse and human glioma cells.",NA,biorxiv

Few of many studies on waterborne AMR spread have characterised the prevalence, sources, and transport of AMR in adequate detail to inform mathematical modelling and exposure risk assessments. Here, we quantified taxonomic and resistance genes (ARGs), sensitive and resistant bacteria (ARBs), and environmental conditions in water and sediment samples at ten locations along the Musi River through Hyderabad, a city renowned for antimicrobial manufacturing, to develop a hydraulic model for AMR spread in the catchment. In the dry season, absolute water column ARG and ARB abundances increased rapidly upon entering the city, then declined downstream. In the wet season, the increase and decline of AMR levels was more gradual. Clustering and ordination of ARGs separated the river into three stretches: upstream, city, and downstream. Most ARGs and water quality indicators differed significantly between stretches and seasons (p<0.05; PERMANOVA). Linear Discriminant Analysis showed that various water quality parameters, such as lower dissolved oxygen and elevated total nitrogen, can distinguish between AMR-polluted and less-polluted sites and might be good proxies to detect AMR hotspots. Modelling showed that 60%-80% of river water in the city was untreated wastewater, suggesting municipal wastewater dominated AMR in the river, not manufacturing sources. This will be a typical situation where wastewater treatment is insufficient and dilution in receiving water bodies limited, highlighting the urgent need for improved wastewater management to make rivers like the Musi safer for use, such as irrigation, reducing AMR exposures across wider environments.

Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the phage had a myovirus morphotype with an icosahedral head and a long contractile tail. Characterization experiments show that the phage was stable across a temperature range of 4{degrees}C to 60{degrees}C, a pH of 4 to 12, and a salinity range of 0.5 % to 16%. One-step growth curve analysis revealed a burst size of 30 PFU/Cell and a latent period of 20 minutes. The phage contains a double-stranded DNA with 136,927 bp and 34.93% GC content. The NCBI Blastn analysis reveals that vB_CoeS_P1 exhibits very low sequence similarity (1% query coverage and 77.82% identity) with Vb_VpaM_R16F (OP793884.1).

This process consists of two major steps: phosphorylation of the receptor by GPCR kinases (GRKs), predominantly on its C-terminus, and recruitment of arrestin, resulting in different signaling outcomes.

We carried out an NMR-based study of the phosphorylation patterns generated by GRK1 and GRK2 on C-terminal peptides of selected receptors (rhodopsin for GRK1, and {beta}1- and {beta}2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) for GRK2). Our data reveal that the kinases are promiscuous with respect to the substrate peptide, but produce clearly defined phosphorylation patterns on each substrate. We found pronounced differences in the rates at which certain residues are phosphorylated, in particular in the PXPP motifs in rhodopsin and {beta}1AR. These results show, that GRKs produce well-defined phosphorylation patterns in absence of further modulators like the full receptor or G{beta}{gamma}, and that the time profile of the phosphorylation barcode seems to be largely encoded in the minimal pair of C-terminal peptide and GRK. The data further suggest that arrestin might encounter different phosphorylation barcodes over time, potentially inducing different responses at different time points in the desensitization process.",NA,biorxiv

Most of the studies have addressed functional connectivity matrices by estimating correlation coefficients between different brain areas, despite well-known disadvantages compared to partial correlation connectivity matrices. Indeed, partial correlation represents a more sensible model for structural connectivity since, under a Gaussian approximation, it accounts only for direct dependencies between brain areas. Motivated by this and following previous results by different authors, we investigate structure-function coupling using partial correlation matrices of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activity time series under different regularization (a.k.a. noise-cleaning) algorithms. We find that, across different algorithms and conditions, partial correlation provides a higher match with structural connectivity retrieved from Density Weighted Imaging data than standard correlation, and this occurs at both subject and population levels. Importantly, we also show that the precise regularization and thresholding strategy are crucial for this match to emerge.

Preclinical models of nicotine self-administration can serve as important lodestars in the search for effective intervention and prevention tactics. Current variants of the task have substantial limitations, however. Therefore, we created the Rodent Electronic Nicotine Delivery System, a novel low-cost non-proprietary nose-only preclinical model of nicotine aerosol self-administration. We confirmed that RENDS sequesters nicotine aerosol in the nose port by measuring fine particulate matter (PM < 2.5 microns) generated by e-cigarettes. We also showed that rats robustly self-administer flavored nicotine aerosol, resulting in high blood levels of cotinine (the major nicotine metabolite) and spontaneous somatic withdrawal symptoms. Thus, we provide strong validation of the operation and function of the RENDS, opening the door to an open-source preclinical aerosol model of nicotine self-administration that is relatively low cost.

Despite their shared origin, there has been relatively little comparison between the downstream gene regulatory networks and how they may differently pattern and shape these appendages. In the pre-tarsal region of the developing leg and antennae of Drosophila, a combination of the transcription factors C15, Lim1 homeobox 1 (Lim1), and Al (Aristaless) are required for the development of the leg tarsal claws and antennal aristae. However, the roles and interactions of these factors in genital development, and their relationship with other leg-patterning genes, remained unexplored. Here, we investigated the expression and function of C15, Lim1, and Al in the development of male and female terminalia (genitalia and analia). We found that C15 plays distinct roles in the different sexes, repressing male clasper bristle formation while promoting bristle development in the female epiproct. Notably, unlike in the antennal and leg discs, C15, Lim1, and Al are not all co-expressed in any anal or genital structures in either sex, indicating that the interactions among these factors have diverged across serially homologous appendages. Nevertheless, we inferred regulatory interactions between C15 and other factors, including bric a brac 2 and Distal-less, reflecting similarities between leg and genital development consistent with their homology. Finally, we identified a male-specific enhancer of C15, likely regulated by the Hox gene Abdominal-B (Abd-B), which is active in male claspers but not in the female terminalia, legs or antennae. This C15 enhancer modularity may underpin tissue-specific regulatory logic, presumably programmed by distinct Hox inputs such as Abd-B in the genitalia, and could contribute to the diversification of serially homologous ventral appendages.",NA,biorxiv

Previous methods have used noisy datasets, including mRNA transcripts in tools intended for lncRNAs, and excluded lncRNAs lacking significant differential localization between the cytoplasm and nucleus. In order to overcome these shortcomings, a method has been developed for predicting cytoplasm-associated lncRNAs in 15 human cell-lines, identifying which lncRNAs are more abundant in the cytoplasm compared to the nucleus. All models in this study were trained using five-fold cross validation and tested on an independent dataset. Initially, we developed machine and deep learning based models using traditional features like composition and correlation. Using composition and correlation based features, machine learning algorithms achieved an average AUC of 0.7049 and 0.7089, respectively for 15 cell-lines. Secondly, we developed machine based models developed using embedding features obtained from the large language model DNABERT-2. The average AUC for all the cell-lines achieved by this approach was 0.6604. Subsequently, we also fine-tuned DNABERT-2 on our training dataset and evaluated the fine-tuned DNABERT-2 model on the independent dataset. The fine-tuned DNABERT-2 model achieved an average AUC of 0.6336. Correlation-based features combined with ML algorithms outperform LLM-based models, in the case of predicting differential lncRNA localization. These cell-line specific models as well as web-based service are available to the public from our web server (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cytolncpred/) .

The flea burrows into the skin, leading to acute and chronic inflammation, often exacerbated by bacterial superinfection. Despite its significant public health impact, genomic studies on T. penetrans are scarce. Here, we present the first complete mitochondrial genome of T. penetrans, comprising 17,279 base pairs and encoding 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs and 2 ribosomal RNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of the cox2 gene revealed a divergent basal lineage from Brazil, supporting a South American origin of T. penetrans and highlights genetic differentiation within the Americas. Clustering of the Ecuadorian and African isolates further suggests historical connections, likely linked to transatlantic maritime trade. The tree highlights a strong South American origin and evidence of migration and diversification, facilitated by human and animal movement. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes relying on the protein-coding genes of other fleas revealed that T. penetrans is closely related to Dorcadia ioffi, a semi-sessile flea of goats and sheep in China.

When experimental data are averaged over time, spatial firing fields become apparent. If these firing fields represented only the current position of the animal, a grid cells firing should not depend on whether the animal is running into or out of a firing field. Yet many grid cells are sensitive to the animals direction of motion relative to the firing-field center. Such apparent egocentric ""inbound-outbound tuning"" could be a sign of prospective encoding of future position, but it is unclear whether grid cells code ahead in space or in time. To investigate this question, we decided to undo the inbound-outbound modulation by shifting all spikes within a given firing field by a fixed distance in space or in time. For grid-cell data recorded in mice, optimizing in space requires a forward shift of around 2.5 cm, whereas optimizing in time yielded a forward shift of about 170 ms. In either case the firing-field sizes decrease. Minimizing just the field size yields somewhat smaller shifts (roughly 1.8 cm and around 115 ms ahead). Jointly optimizing along the temporal and spatial dimension reveals a continuum of flat inbound-outbound tuning curves and a shallow minimum for field sizes, located at about 2.3 cm and 35 ms. These findings call into question a purely spatial or purely temporal interpretation of grid-cell firing fields and inbound-outbound tuning.",NA,biorxiv

Due to its long latency period and nonspecific symptoms, the disease is usually detected at advanced stages, limiting available treatment options and leading to poor survival rates. So far, the disease can only be confirmed through invasive thoracoscopic biopsy. Moreover, the proposed circulating protein biomarkers lack sensitivity and specificity, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches.

In our previous work [1], we characterized the transcriptomic profile of extracellular vesicles secreted by PM cells and demonstrated their feasibility as a source of circulating biomarkers. To further investigate the role of circulating RNA in tumor progression and its potential use in non-invasive testing for PM, we present a detailed characterization of RNA cargo carried by PM exosomes - a distinct subset of extracellular vesicles known to serve as key mediators of intercellular communication. By utilizing primary cell cultures established from tissue samples of 11 PM and 6 non-PM patients, followed by exosome isolation, and total RNA sequencing of RNA from isolated exosomes, matching cells, and tissues, we provide new evidence on exosomal RNA secretion, regulation of PM-exosome cargo genes, and their potential functions in recipient cells. We show that PM-exosomal cargo is enriched in genes associated with proliferation, whose key transcriptional factors are SETDB1, FOXM1 and GATA2. We identified Pcbp2, Srsf1 and Srsf9, RNA-binding proteins, which may be involved in selective cargo sorting into PM-exosomes. Our analysis identified six secreted genes, including GAS5, AL031666.3, RSLD1D1, AC103740.2, ADAM10, and AC020892.1, whose exosomal expression was associated with patient survival, as promising biomarkers for patient diagnosis, stratification, and prognosis assessment.

Normally, our visual system performs this task exceptionally well; indeed, under conditions with frames of reference, our ability to detect relative motion exceeds the sampling limits of foveal cones. However, during fixational drift, if an image is programmed to move in a direction consistent with retinal slip, little to no motion is perceived, even if this motion is amplified. We asked: Would a stimulus moving in a direction consistent with retinal slip, but with a smaller magnitude across the retina, also appear relatively stable? We used an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope to deliver stimuli that moved contingent to retinal motion and measured subjects perceived motion, under conditions with world-fixed background content. We also tested under conditions with background content closer and farther from the stimuli. We found a sharp discontinuity in motion perception. Stimuli moving in a direction consistent with retinal slip, no matter how small, appear to have relatively little to no motion; while, stimuli moving in the same direction as eye motion appear to be moving.

It is unclear how these pathways might be adapted to yield similar precision in more complex cell geometries. Here we provide the first description of the dynamics of mitosis in a multi-nucleate, multibudding yeast, Aureobasidium pullulans, and identify many unexpected differences from uninucleate yeasts. Mitotic spindles do not orient along the mother-bud axis prior to anaphase, and accurate nuclear segregation often occurs after spindle disassembly.

The role of PMT in disrupting the mammalian respiratory barrier remains to be elucidated. In this study, we discovered that inoculation of recombinantly expressed PMT increased the permeability of the respiratory epithelial barrier in mouse and respiratory cell models. This was evidenced by a decreased expression of tight junctions (ZO-1, occludin) and adherens junctions ({beta}-catenin, E-cadherin), as well as enhanced cytoskeletal rearrangement. In mechanism, we demonstrated that PMT inoculation induced cytoplasmic Ca2+ inflow, leading to an imbalance of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum stress. This process further stimulated the RhoA/ROCK signaling, promoting cytoskeletal rearrangement and reducing the expression of tight junctions and adherens junctions. Notably, the T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel CaV3.1 was found to participate in PMT-induced cytoplasmic Ca2+ inflow. Knocking out CaV3.1 significantly reduced the cytotoxicity induced by PMT on swine respiratory epithelial cells and mitigated cytoplasmic Ca2+ inflow stimulated by PMT. Further analysis identified Ser (aa92), Glu (aa155), Tyr (aa167), and Leu (aa448) as crucial sites utilized by PMT to interact with CaV3.1. These findings suggest CaV3.1 serves as an important host receptor of PMT and contributes to PMT-induced respiratory epithelial barrier disruption.

ImportancePMT is a significant toxin produced by the zoonotic respiratory pathogen P. multocida, yet little is known about its pathogenesis beyond causing progressive atrophic rhinitis in pigs. In our study, we have discovered that PMT has the capacity to disrupt the integrity of the mammalian respiratory epithelial barrier. This disruption involves an imbalance in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and activation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway induced by PMT. Importantly, we have identified CaV3.1 as a pivotal receptor that plays a crucial role in the pathogenic effects of PMT. Our findings highlight the potential of CaV3.1 as a target for intervention strategies aimed at combating the detrimental effects of PMT.",NA,biorxiv

Given that specific mucosal immune signatures have been identified in FD, we hypothesised that these changes would be associated with specific microbial changes. We aimed to profile the duodenal MAM to identify microbes associated with known changes in FD mucosal and peripheral immune homeostasis. Duodenal biopsies were collected from 11 asymptomatic outpatient controls and 17 FD patients. Separate biopsies were collected for MAM 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, histological evaluation, and mucosal lamina propria mononuclear cell (LPMC) isolation. Where available peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from whole blood. PBMC and LPMC populations were analysed for CD4 and CD8 T cell populations by flow cytometry. Initial comparisons of histological and immune measures revealed significant differences between FD and outpatient controls, with decreased villi goblet cells and increased LPMC CD4 Central Memory, LPMC CD8, and PBMC CD4+ Central Memory Th17 in FD compared to controls. While microbiome profiles varied between groups, specific associations with the histological and immunological scoring found that in controls, villi goblet cells correlated positively with Massilia and negatively with Exiguobacterium, while FD patients showed no significant correlations. Additionally, controls exhibited a negative correlation between LPMC CD4 Central Memory and Veillonella, with FD patients showing no significant correlation. Notably, FD patients demonstrated a significant negative correlation between LPMC CD8 and Sulfophobococcus, and a positive correlation between PBMC CD4+ Central Memory Th17 and both Gemella and Fusobacterium.

ImportanceWhile several papers have reported the alteration in FD duodenal MAM, study numbers are low and consensus on specific biomarker signatures within the microbiome have not been reached. Our findings contribute to this growing body of evidence, indicating that patients with FD exhibit distinct alterations in duodenal MAM and immune profiles compared to outpatient controls. Furthermore, the immune-microbiome associations present in control populations were absent in FD patients suggesting a loss of host-microbiome homeostasis that may contribute to FD pathophysiology. Our work highlights potential microbial biomarkers which may be a consequence or driver of the mucosal micro-inflammation state which is a characteristic of FD. Future work is required to validate whether these specific microbes are responsible for driving inappropriate host immune responses to inform treatment strategies and assist with disorder diagnosis.",NA,biorxiv

The underlying regulatory mechanisms of immune sensitivity remain incompletely understood, particularly in the context of human IECs. To enhance our understanding of the immune response of IECs to bacterial epithelial barrier breach, we investigated whether epithelial responsiveness is contingent on cell identity and cell polarization. We exposed human intestinal organoids to bacterial antigens to study their immune responses. Notable discrepancies were observed in the specific reactions exhibited by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and enterocytes. It was determined that basolateral exposure of IECs to bacterial antigens resulted in a robust response, whereas apical exposure elicited a significantly more modest response. We identified ISCs as the responders, while the reaction of enterocytes was found to be attenuated. The regulation of bacterial responsiveness in enterocytes occurs at multiple levels, including the modulation of NF{kappa}B activation and post-transcriptional control of mRNA stability. Our findings demonstrate that differentiated non-responsive enterocytes can be sensitized to bacterial antigens through the activation of the WNT pathway.

The wide range of ATPase rates in these constructs allows us to probe how Msp1 uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to perform the thermodynamically unfavorable task of removing a transmembrane helix (TMH) from a lipid bilayer. Our in vitro and in vivo assays reveal a non-linear relationship between ATP hydrolysis and membrane protein extraction, suggesting a minimum ATP hydrolysis rate is required for effective TMH extraction. While structural data often supports a sequential clockwise/2-residue step (SC/2R) mechanism for ATP hydrolysis, our biochemical evidence suggests mechanistic plasticity in how Msp1 coordinates ATP hydrolysis between subunits, potentially allowing for robustness in processing challenging substrates.

Analysis supported a model in which gpUL141 homodimers independently interacted with separate gB/gH-containing complexes. gpUL141 encodes an ER retention domain that restricts trafficking through the ER/golgi, and limited the transport of glycoprotein complexes bound by gpUL141. As a result, gpUL141 reduced levels of multiple glycoprotein complexes on the infected cell surface as well as in the virion. This reduced syncytia formation, inhibited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and reduced susceptibility to neutralising antibodies. Thus, gpUL141 represents an immune-evasin that not only targets host proteins to limit NK-cell attack, but also alters the trafficking of multiple viral glycoprotein complexes in order to evade humoral immunity.

SignificanceThe large number of immune-modulators encoded by HCMV has led to it becoming a paradigm for pathogen-mediated immune-modulation. These mechanisms have informed on virus pathogenesis, the evolution and function of host defences, and identified therapeutic targets. Previously discovered immune-evasins functioned by modifying host proteins. gpUL141 represents a novel strategy in which multiple immunological functions are targeted through manipulating eight different viral entry glycoproteins, via interactions with two proteins common to multiple complexes. Entry glycoproteins define virus tropism, mechanisms of infection and spread, and susceptibility to neutralising and non-neutralising antibody activities, yet UL141 is frequently mutated in passaged viruses. This demonstrates the need to work with virus strains encoding the complete repertoire of viral accessory proteins during preclinical therapeutic development.",NA,biorxiv

CDNF was safe and well tolerated in phase 1 clinical trials for PD treatment, and currently, its peptide analogue is under investigation in phase 1 clinical trials for PD. Despite prominent neuroprotective and neurorestorative activity, the receptors and exact mechanism of CDNF functioning have been obscure. Intracellularly acting CDNF exerts cytoprotection by attenuating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR). We demonstrated that this activity occurs through the direct binding of CDNF to ER transmembrane UPR sensors PERK and IRE1 for purified proteins and in cells. We identified CDNF mutants deficient for binding to UPR sensors. CDNF binding to PERK and IRE1 appeared to be crucial for the survival of mouse dopamine neurons in culture. Importantly for clinical translation, CDNF rescues human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopamine neurons and promotes their regeneration. CDNF binding to UPR sensors alleviated terminal UPR and promoted neurite outgrowth of human dopamine neurons through direct binding to PERK and IRE1. CDNF binding to BiP was dispensable for the neuroprotective and neurorestorative activity of CDNF. Therefore, CDNF, or small molecules mimicking its binding to UPR sensors and acting selectively on dopamine neurons with activated UPR, are promising drug candidates for PD treatment.",NA,biorxiv

Direct measurement of their autophosphorylation activity is crucial for developing inhibitors and advancing disease treatments. While [{gamma}-32P]-ATP radiolabeling has long been a conventional method for kinase activity measurements, its reliance on 32P introduces inherent limitations. The isotopes short half-life imposes time-sensitive constraints on experiments, and stringent radiation safety and compliance requirements significantly increase operational costs and hinder scalability. Several alternative methods, including fluorescent phosphate-binding probes and fluorescence- or luminescence-based antibodies, have been developed for HKs that overcome these challenges. However, for heme-based HKs, these alternatives suffer from interference due to intrinsic heme fluorescence and luminescence. In this work, we address this interference by employing a near-IR fluorophore-labeled secondary antibody. Combined with an ATP{gamma}S immunoblot-based method, we demonstrate semi-quantitative detection of thiophosphorylation activities of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DosS (a prototypical heme-based HK) in different ligation states. Consistent with previous radiolabeling studies, we show DosSs ability for auto-thiophosphorylation is significantly enhanced with CO as compared to O2.

In this study, we used single follicle RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify transcriptional signatures of staged ovarian follicles, from primordial to secondary stages, to uncover the genes and pathways involved in early folliculogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that primordial follicles are transcriptionally distinct from growing follicles, with enrichment in DNA integrity and RNA processing pathways, which may play a role in preserving oocyte genomic stability and cell state during dormancy. Additionally, our analysis reveals minimal transcriptomic differences between primary and secondary follicles using traditional differential expression analysis. To better distinguish growing follicle stages, we introduce unsupervised approaches, including discrete-variable predictors of follicle stage and weighted gene co-expression analysis. We identified pathways involved in DNA integrity, meiotic arrest, and cellular metabolism that drive the transition from dormant to active follicle states, as well as pathways related to cellular growth, ECM organization, and biosynthesis in growing follicle stages. Our study offers novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing early follicle activation and growth, providing a foundation for future research with applications in reproductive biology, contraception, and fertility preservation.

Author SummaryThe development of ovarian follicles is essential for female fertility, but the molecular signals that control their growth remain unclear. In this study, we used advanced gene sequencing techniques to analyze the genetic activity of individual ovarian follicles at different stages of early development. We found that dormant follicles have unique gene expression patterns that help protect the genetic material of the egg and maintain their inactive state. In contrast, follicles that have begun to grow show increased activity in genes related to cell growth, communication, and structural changes. Interestingly, we observed that early growing follicles are more similar to each other than previously thought, prompting us to apply new analytical methods to better distinguish their developmental stages. Our findings highlight key biological pathways that regulate the transition from dormant to active follicles and uncover new genes that may play a role in this process. Understanding these mechanisms provides valuable insights into ovarian biology and could inform future research on fertility treatments, contraception, and reproductive health.",NA,biorxiv

While previous studies have reported inconsistent associations between MASLD and key microbial clades using low-resolution 16S rRNA profiling, we employed high-resolution metagenomic sequencing and multi-marker taxonomic classification across three independent cohorts to identify robust microbial and functional signatures of MASLD. We consistently detected a depletion of Agathobacter rectalis, a known butyrate producer, in MASLD patients. Functionally, MASLD was characterized by a depletion of genes involved in butyrate and methane biosynthesis-particularly within the crotonyl-butyryl-CoA axis-alongside an enrichment of genes driving the production of endogenous alcohols such as ethanol and 1-propanol. Genes encoding these fermentative pathways, often organized in operons like pdu and tor, were more abundant in MASLD samples, indicating a potential shift toward alcohol-producing metabolism. These geno-metabolic changes were accompanied by a broader displacement of beneficial taxa and an increase in accessory gene content across the GM, underscoring the limitations of taxonomy-based disease associations. Many of the differentially abundant genes were also found on plasmids, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer contributes to strain-level metabolic variability relevant to MASLD progression. Our findings support a model in which GM-driven metabolic shifts-rather than taxonomic changes alone-play a central role in MASLD pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of functional and mobile genetic element (MGEs) profiling for uncovering mechanistic links between the microbiome and liver disease.",NA,biorxiv

Recent advances in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy have shown promising potential for treating glioblastoma; however, achieving optimal efficacy remains challenging due to tumor antigen heterogeneity, the tumor microenvironment, and T-cell exhaustion. In this study, we developed a mathematical model of CAR T-cell therapy for glioblastoma to explore combinations of CAR T-cell treatments that take into account the spatial heterogeneity of antigen expression. Our hybrid model, created using the multicellular modeling platform PhysiCell, couples partial differential equations that describe the tumor microenvironment with agent-based models for glioblastoma and CAR T-cells. The model captures cell-to-cell interactions between the glioblastoma cells and CAR T-cells throughout treatment, focusing on three target antigens: IL-13R2, HER2, and EGFR. We analyze tumor antigen expression heterogeneity informed by expression patterns identified from human tissues and investigate patient-specific combination CAR T-cell treatment strategies. Our model demonstrates that an early intervention is the most effective approach, especially in glioblastoma tumors characterized by mixed antigen expression. However, in tissues with clustered antigen patterns, we find that sequential administration with specific CAR T-cell types can achieve efficacy comparable to simultaneous administration. In addition, spatially targeted delivery of CAR T-cells to specific tumor regions with matching antigen is an effective strategy as well. Our model provides a valuable platform for developing patient-specific CAR T-cell treatment plans with the potential to optimize scheduling and locations of CAR T-cell injections based on individual antigen expression profiles.",NA,biorxiv

Considering that hyper-activation of IRE1 induces cell death, we hypothesize that activation of IRE1 could be an alternative way for tumor suppression. Here, we identified divalent manganese ion as a potent activator to IRE1, which interacts with the cytosolic part of IRE1 directly, augmenting the downstream pro-apoptotic pathway but not the pro-survival outcome.

To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel molecular screening platform using an extracellular vesicle (EV) display library. EVs are natural molecular carriers capable of delivering diverse cargos, which can be engineered to enhance specificity and targeting through surface modifications. We constructed an EV-display library presenting monobody repertoires on EV surfaces, with genetic cargo inside the EVs corresponding to the displayed proteins. These libraries were screened for tissue specific delivery through serial passage in mice via sequential intravenous administration in and recovery of tissue-selected EVs and amplification of their encapsulated monobody genes at each passage. Our results demonstrated successful selection of tissue-specific targeting proteins, as revealed by fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging followed by DNA sequencing. To understand the stochastic relationship between displayed proteins and packaged genes, we developed a Markov chain model that quantified selection dynamics and predicted enrichment patterns despite the imperfect correlation between phenotype and genotype.

C. pacifica is a unicellular extremophile capable of surviving at high pH, high temperatures, and high salinity. These various growth conditions allow C. pacifica to outcompete any invading contaminants in open-air environments. Developing this novel species as a platform for recombinant protein production could significantly advance commercial microalgal recombinant protein production. We have previously shown that C. reinhardtii can secrete a plastic-degrading enzyme: a PETase known as PHL7. This PETase is capable of cleaving ester bonds and has been used commercially for the degradation of PET plastics. However, the expression of such an enzyme has yet to be done in open raceway ponds and on a large scale. Here, we describe the culturing of PHL7 transgenic C. pacifica strain in three 80L raceway ponds and the measurements of recombinant enzymatic expression and activity found in the culture media. Our work provides proof of concept that this new organism can produce functional PHL7 enzymes in addition to producing the valuable components that inherently exist in the C. pacifica algae biomass.

We developed a genetically defined sst1-susceptible mouse model that uniquely reproduces a defining feature of human TB: the development of necrotic lung granulomas and determined that the sst1-susceptible phenotype was driven by the aberrant macrophage activation. This study demonstrates that the aberrant response of the sst1-susceptible macrophages to prolonged stimulation with TNF is primarily driven by conflicting Myc and antioxidant response pathways leading to a coordinated failure 1) to properly sequester intracellular iron and 2) to activate ferroptosis inhibitor enzymes. Consequently, iron-mediated lipid peroxidation fueled IFN{beta} superinduction and sustained the Type I Interferon (IFN-I) pathway hyperactivity that locked the sst1-susceptible macrophages in a state of unresolving stress and compromised their resistance to Mtb. The accumulation of the aberrantly activated, stressed, macrophages within granuloma microenvironment led to the local failure of anti-tuberculosis immunity and tissue necrosis. The upregulation of Myc pathway in peripheral blood cells of human TB patients was significantly associated with poor outcomes of TB treatment. Thus, Myc dysregulation in activated macrophages results in an aberrant macrophage activation and represents a novel target for host-directed TB therapies.",NA,biorxiv

This, combined with emerging evidence linking lipids to neurodegeneration, cardiovascular health, and other diseases, makes lipids a critical class of analytes to assess normal and abnormal cellular processes. While previous work has examined the lipid composition of stem cells, uncertainties remain about which changes are conserved and which are unique across distinct cell types. In this study, we investigated lipid alterations of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) at critical stages of differentiation toward neural or mesodermal fates.

Behavioural consistency in paradise fish was also supported by arm alternation as a predominant choice of exploration in the y-maze task. In summary, our results indicate that the behaviour of paradise fish is less biased by social cues and is more effective and repeatable in individual-based assays than zebrafish behaviour. We hypothesise that the two phenomena are connected and novelty exploration, anxiety and working memory can be more reliably measured and are translatable in a solitaire species.",NA,biorxiv

Recruitment of RAD51 involves eight highly conserved regions on BRCA2, named BRC repeats. To date, only the interaction between the fourth BRC repeat (BRC4) and the RAD51 C-terminal domain has been structurally characterized, while the complex of full-length RAD51 with the peptide still remains elusive. Here, we report an integrative experimental and in silico approach to reconstruct the conformational ensemble in solution for full length RAD51 in complex with BRC4. We combined AlphaFold2, crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) data with molecular dynamics simulations (MD). These data show that the full-length RAD51-BRC4 complex is a mixture of compact and elongated conformations. Detailed analysis of the reweighted ensemble, achieved through the maximum entropy principle, identifies key residues at the N-terminal-BRC4 interface mediating complex conformational dynamics. Our evidence provides robust atomic-level insights into the interaction of RAD51 and BRC4. These findings are crucial for understanding the molecular features underlying the recognition between RAD51 and BRCA2, which are essential for developing therapeutic intervention strategies in cancer treatment.",NA,biorxiv

Recent discoveries of several new Paramyxoviridae species, including the zoonotic Langya virus 2, have revealed much higher antigenic diversity than currently characterized and prompted the reorganization of these viruses into the Henipavirus and Parahenipavirus genera 3. Here, to explore the limits of structural and antigenic variation in both genera, collectively referred to here as HNVs, we constructed an expanded, antigenically diverse panel of HNV fusion and attachment glycoproteins from 56 unique HNV strains that better reflects global HNV diversity. We expressed and purified the fusion protein ectodomains and the attachment protein head domains and characterized their biochemical, biophysical and structural properties. We performed immunization experiments in mice leading to the elicitation of antibodies reactive to multiple HNV fusion proteins. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of diverse fusion proteins elucidated molecular determinants of differential pre-fusion state metastability and higher order contacts. A crystal structure of the Gamak virus attachment head domain revealed an additional domain added to the conserved 6-bladed, {beta}-propeller fold.

Advances in the search for novel DMD treatments, particularly at cell and molecular levels, rely heavily on the use of translational animal models. It is crucial that these models faithfully recapitulate the human clinical phenotype to best expedite the development of promising treatments.

We sought comprehensively to describe the cardiac phenotype of DE50-MD dogs, a novel dystrophin-deficient model that harbours a mutation within the principal DMD mutational hotspot. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiographic studies were performed at approximately 12-week intervals in male, 3- to 18- month-old DE50-MD (n=17) and age-matched littermates, wild type (WT, n=14) dogs. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging was performed in a subpopulation of DE50-MD (n=10) and WT (n=11) dogs aged 9 to 18 months. The DE50-MD dogs had smaller left ventricular (LV) mass and LV dimensions than WT dogs. While global ventricular systolic function was preserved, DE50-MD dogs showed early differences in strain and strain rate parameters. Only DE50-MD dogs demonstrated LGE (3/8 dogs studied at 18 months); the subepicardial to transmural, mid-to-basal LV LGE distribution resembling that of DMD patients and of other dystrophic dog models. Histopathological assessment confirmed that LGE corresponded to fibrofatty myocardial scarring, as described in DMD patients and other canine models of dystrophin-deficient cardiomyopathy. The DE50-MD early preclinical cardiac phenotype shares key features of DMD cardiomyopathy prior to onset of global LV systolic dysfunction. Their disproportionately low LV volume to mass supports possible combined physiological hypotrophy and tonic contraction in affected animals.",NA,biorxiv

While it has been observed that some condensates rapidly coalesce, some others only attach to each other, or do not establish persistent interactions over time. Here, we explain these observations through optical tweezers and Molecular Dynamics simulations focusing on two condensate-forming, RNA-binding proteins--FUS and G3BP1--strongly involved in RNA metabolism and stress responses. We find that the fusion of pure droplets formed by these proteins can give rise to multiphase single-component condensates exhibiting notably different densities, architectures, and material properties. Such behaviour is dictated by the relative timescales of condensate fusion and protein internal mixing. A critical parameter controlling this interplay is the extent of ageing that condensates display; e.g., their progressive hardening driven by the accumulation of inter-protein {beta}-sheet assemblies over time. Strikingly, different degrees of ageing in fusing droplets can lead single-component condensates to form diverse architectures including concentric drops or two-sided condensates. Overall, our results highlight a mechanism, based on the temporal coupling between ageing, fusion, and mixing rate, by which biomolecular condensates form multiphasic structures with markedly different material properties, and hence potentially distinct biological roles.",NA,biorxiv

In annelids this pathway is active from the earliest stages of reparative morphogenesis, yet its specific function remains unclear. Here we have functionally examined FGF signaling following the amputation of posterior segments in the marine annelid Alitta virens. We utilized the pharmacological agent SU5402 to inhibit the FGF receptor kinase at different time points. With whole-mount in situ hybridization we analyzed the expression of regulatory genes that pattern posterior territories (cdx, evx, post2), multipotent/germ cells (vasa, piwi), mesodermal tissues (twist), and segmental boundaries (engrailed). Our findings reveal that FGF signaling is essential for blastema induction by promoting dedifferentiation and proliferation of cells at the wound site but is not involved in posteriorization. On the contrary, this pathway is crucial for differentiation in the anterior part of the regenerative bud, impacting its mesodermal derivatives and segment boundary formation. Comparative analysis suggests that while certain functions of FGF signaling, particularly in mesodermal patterning, are conserved across taxa, its role in posterior axis elongation appears to have evolved specifically within the vertebrate lineage. This research enhances our understanding of the evolutionary origins and functional diversification of FGF signaling in regeneration, positioning A. virens as a valuable model for exploring the complexities of regenerative biology.",NA,biorxiv

Doses ranging from 10 to 250 Gy caused developmental anomalies. High mortality rates were observed at doses of 100 to 500 Gy. Post-fertilization irradiation at 50 to 100 Gy resulted in 100% lethality, while exposure to 10 Gy led to only 13% lethality, although both exposure levels produced similar types of developmental anomalies compared to pre-fertilization irradiation. This study highlights how the timing and intensity of exposure critically affect embryo viability, especially during the sensitive stages of fertilization and gastrulation. We establish the necessary and sufficient dosage to further investigate the molecular mechanisms of X-ray damage to DNA and protein.

Patients are diagnosed based upon movement disorders, including bradykinesia, tremor and stiffness of movement. However, non-motor signs, including constipation, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, smell deficits and pain are well recognized. Peripheral neuropathy is also increasingly recognized, as the vast majority of patients show reduced intraepidermal nerve fibers, and sensory nerve conduction and sensory function is also impaired. Many case studies in the literature show that high-dose levodopa, the primary drug used in the treatment of PD, may exacerbate neuropathy, thought to involve levodopas metabolism to homocysteine. Here, we treated primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia and a sensory neuronal cell line with levodopa to examine effects on cell morphology, mitochondrial content and physiology, and lysosomal function. High-dose levo-dopa reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. At concentrations observed in the patient, levo-dopa enhanced immunoreactivity to beta III tubulin. Critically, levodopa reduced lysosomal content and also reduced the proportion of lysosomes that were acidic while homocysteine tended to have the opposite effect. Levodopa is a critically important drug for the treatment of PD. However, our data suggests that at concentrations observed in the patient, it has deleterious effects on sensory neurons that are not related to homocysteine.

Simple SummaryParkinsons disease (PD) is one of the most common chronic, degenerative brain diseases worldwide. Patients are diagnosed on the basis of slowness of movement and/or tremor and/or stiffness. However, many symptoms that are not movement related are now well recognized. Patients show changes in skin sensation, and the vast majority of patients show loss of sensory neurites, which enable sensation in skin. These changes in skin sensation occur prior to diagnosis; however, sensory issues may also be exacerbated by levodopa, an important drug used in the treatment of PD. Undoubtedly, levodopa is critical for the treatment of PD, but at high doses, it has repeatedly been shown to impair sensation in PD patients. Here, we show for the first time that high-dose levodopa impairs function of sensory neurons. Importantly, we also show for the first time that lysosomes, a critical organelle involved in recycling, are impaired by levodopa concentrations observed in patients. These data are important given the well-known lysosomal dysfunction observed in PD. Our data sheds light on how levodopa, the most important drug in the treatment of PD, may contribute to sensory deficits in PD.",NA,biorxiv

Recent studies have reported that -synuclein undergoes phase separation to form biomolecular condensates both in vitro and in mammalian cells4-7. -synuclein condensates are thought to contribute to disease through progressive aggregation5,8,9. Here we show that specific PD-associated -synuclein variants fail to form biomolecular condensates. We demonstrate that only two -synuclein variants associated with familial disease, E46K and E83Q, enhance condensate formation in vitro and in cells. However, variants including A30G, G51D, and A53E fail to form or have reduced levels of condensate formation in cells. The same phenotypes are reflected in the budding yeast model showing differential inclusion formation. In iPSC-derived neurons, the propensity of -synuclein variants to undergo VAMP2-mediated phase separation reflects the level of synaptic enrichment. We show that the intrinsic propensity of -synuclein to form condensates and the ability to bind lipid membranes are important to mediate condensate formation in cells. Our results emphasize that -synuclein pathology follows divergent pathways, with both increased and decreased condensate formation contributing to disease. This study establishes biomolecular condensates as a key intermediate in -synuclein dysfunction, providing a novel foundation for translational research.",NA,biorxiv

Recent studies reveal that mitochondria become dysfunctional following numerous cellular stresses, and during pathologies, demanding an extensive investigation of mitochondrial turnover mechanisms. Apart from the specific response pathways to tackle different stresses, mitophagy or degradation of mitochondria by autophagy is a critical quality control mechanism that clears irreversibly damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy is majorly executed either by receptor-mediated or PINK-Parkin-dependent pathways. Here, we show that the human orthologue of yeast Vms1, ANKZF1, participates in PINK-Parkin-mediated mitophagy. We show that ANKZF1 is extensively recruited to damaged mitochondria along with Parkin during mitochondrial proteotoxic stress induced by the expression of a single misfolded/aggregated protein or during uncoupler-induced membrane depolarization. Importantly, ANKZF1 recruitment to damaged mitochondria is significantly enhanced in the presence of Parkin, and ANKZF1 physically interacts with Parkin and LC3 during mitochondrial proteotoxic or depolarization stresses. ANKZF1 harbors six putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs), LIR4 present at residues 333-336 is particularly important for ANKZF1-LC3 interaction. Furthermore, we show that ANKZF1 knockout cells are compromised in clearing stress-damaged mitochondria by mitophagy, indicating an important role of ANKZF1 in mitochondrial turnover during stress. In summary, we show a new role of ANKZF1 in eliminating the stress-damaged mitochondria, reiterating the mito-protective role of Vms1/ANKZF1 during mitochondrial stresses.",NA,biorxiv

These tumours can affect nerve function, leading to pain and loss of sensory or motor capacity. Drug treatments are currently limited, and relatively few new targets have emerged for NF1 tumors despite intensive research. Therefore, new drugs to target NF1-deficient tumour cells are urgently required. Here, we have used a cross-species screening strategy combined with bioinformatic analysis to identify candidates with a high chance of successful translation to humans. First, we used data from a synthetic lethal screen performed in Drosophila cells to identify novel drug targets of NF1. Then, we performed statistical enrichment analysis of the screen results to identify further candidate targets that were not conserved between Drosophila and humans and could not have been found in the screen. We identified and validated hTERT as a synthetic lethal partner gene to NF1 with high potential as a therapeutic drug target, using the FDA-approved inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT). The lethal effect of AZT was validated in peripheral neurofibroma NF1-deficient human cell lines and NF1-deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour cells. The effect of AZT was also conserved in vivo, highlighting the translational potential; treatment of mice with AZT inhibited NF1 mutant xenograft growth to the same extent as the current clinically approved MEK inhibitor, selumetinib.

While these models have shown promising results, they often lack robust performance guarantees. The aim of this study was three-fold: to quantify the uncertainty of these classifiers; to provide prediction sets that control the false negative rate (FNR); and to perform implicit reduction by transforming incorrect predictions into uncertain predictions.

MethodsConformal prediction is a distribution-agnostic framework for generating statistically calibrated prediction sets whose size reflects model uncertainty. In this study, we applied an extension called conformal risk control to ALLIUM, an RNA-seq ALL subtype classifier. Leveraging RNA-seq data from 1042 patient samples taken at diagnosis, we developed a multi-class conformal predictor, ALLCoP, which generates statistically guaranteed FNR-controlled prediction sets.

ResultsALLCoP was able to create prediction sets with specified FNR tolerances ranging from 7.5-30%. In a validation cohort, ALLCoP successfully reduced the FNR of the ALLIUM classifier from 8.95% to 3.5%. For cases whose subtype was not previously known, the use of ALLCoP was able to reduce the occurrence of empty predictions from 37% to 17%. Notably, up to 34% of the multiple-class prediction sets included the PAX5alt subtype, suggesting that increased prediction set size may reflect secondary aberrations and biological complexity, contributing to classifier uncertainty. Finally, ALLCoP was validated on two additional RNA-seq ALL subtype classifiers, ALLSorts and ALLCatchR.

Unifying results from previous studies, we show that an average human gut contains a low ratio of phage particles to bacterial cells ([~]1:100), but a much larger ratio of phage genomes to bacterial genomes ([~]4:1), implying that most gut phage are effectively temperate (e.g., integrated prophage, phage-plasmids, etc.). By integrating imaging and sequencing data with a generalized model of temperate phage dynamics, we estimate that phage induction and lysis occurs at a low average rate ([~]0.001-0.01 per bacterium per day), imposing only a modest fitness burden on their bacterial hosts. Consistent with these estimates, we find that the phage composition of a diverse synthetic community in gnotobiotic mice can be quantitatively predicted from bacterial abundances alone, while still exhibiting phage diversity comparable to native human microbiomes. These results provide a foundation for interpreting existing and future studies on links between the gut virome and human health.",10.1016/j.cub.2025.03.073,biorxiv

Notably, flies developed a strong preference for immobile over mobile objects, despite their near identical appearance, suggesting they learn about object stability through physical interaction. This preference was impaired by silencing specific h{Delta} neurons in the fan-shaped body, a circuit known for spatial navigation through vector computations. h{Delta} neurons also modulated object interaction motifs and fidelity of following visual guidance cues, pointing to a role in balancing goal-directed and exploratory behaviors.

This approach challenges accepted interpretations of oscillatory behavior and emphasizes the importance of examining phenomena at appropriate temporal scales, as opposed to trial averages. Diversity in the detailed temporal form of these real-time phenomena has been under-considered, yet it should provide important information about function. Here we studied such bursts at beta frequencies, and explicitly distinguished transient bursts characterized by high power (BoP) and those marked by consistent cycles (BoC) using methods tailored to capture each characteristic. Analysis of neural recordings from mice and macaques revealed two distinct and largely independent beta burst categories within the same temporal content. Importantly, these two classes of beta burst showed differing functional relevance within the same signal. In a search-repeat task, BoC bursts occurred more often in the search phase, whereas BoP bursts dominated the repeat phase. As such, beta frequency neural signals encompass at least two transient phenomena, each with potentially distinct functional roles.",NA,biorxiv

This process is fundamental to how we perceive the world around us and allows our visual system to efficiently encode and process visual information. The retina incorporates adaptaion with its dozens of functionally distinct retinal ganglion cell types. Meanwhile, the field of retinal prostheses is increasing its understanding of electrical adaptation and cell-specific stimulation. However, very little is known about the interaction of visual and electrical stimulation on the adaptation of retinal ganglion cell types.

Methods/ApproachRecording with a microelectrode array (MEA), we presented an ON and OFF full-field, visual stimulus to characterize various visual response parameters in healthy and degenerating rd10 mouse retinas. We then evaluated visual response changes before and after blocks of monophasic voltage-controlled electrical pulse stimulation.

Main ResultsA history of electrical stimulation strengthened visual responses in WT retina, even when changes attributable to in vitro visual adaptation were taken into account. In rd10 retinas, electrical adaptation counteracted the baseline in vitro visual adaptation. In all cases, adaptation often affected the ON and OFF visual response components differentially. Consequently, the ON/OFF classification of indiviual cells changed as a result of adaptation.

SignificanceElectrical stimulation-induced changes in the retina should be considered in the encoding of visual stimuli by retinal prosthetic devices. In vitro investigations for bionic vision should strive to probe electrical responsiveness after adaptation to ongoing electrical stimulation has achieved a steady-state.",NA,biorxiv

Iridoids play key roles in plant defense and are also essential precursors for pharmacologically important alkaloids (Dobler et al, 2011; Eisner, 1964). The biosynthesis of all iridoids involves the cyclization of a reactive enol intermediate. While this cyclization occurs spontaneously at low yields, it has long been hypothesized that a dedicated enzyme is involved in this process (Geu-Flores et al, 2012; Lichman et al, 2019b).

We show that these enzymes catalyze cyclization of the reactive intermediate to form the two major iridoid stereoisomers found in plants. Our work uncovers the last missing key step in the otherwise well-characterized iridoid biosynthesis pathway in asterids.

ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis reveals that AurA inhibition restricts chromatin accessibility of genes associated with inflammatory pathways such as JAK-STAT, TNF and NF-{kappa}B pathways. Specifically, AurA inhibition promotes nuclear localization of FOXO3 and the expression of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), a key enzyme responsible for adenosylmethionine (SAM) consumption. Metabolomic analysis confirms a reduction in SAM level upon AurA inhibition. As a result of SAM deficiency, trained mouse macrophages exhibit decreased H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment on gene regions of Il6 and Tnf. Additionally, the tumor inhibition effect of {beta}-glucan is notably abolished by AurA inhibition. Together, our findings identify an essential role of AurA in regulating trained immunity via a methylation-dependent manner by maintaining endogenous SAM level through mTOR-FOXO3-GNMT axis.",NA,biorxiv

Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we identified that the characteristic electron-dense bodies in trapping devices contained more iron than vacuoles and mitochondria. Meanwhile, fungal mycelial cells used effective desferriferrichromes for iron chelation and storage. Complex bioassays showed that electron-dense bodies represent a novel type of microbial iron storage particle and trapping devices in A. oligospora function as an unprecedented phenotypic system for iron storage. Unexpectedly, all NTFs lack a crucial Ccc1-mediated vacuolar iron detoxification mechanism, which is conserved in most fungi. Inserting the Ccc1 gene cloned from yeast into A. oligospora significantly reduced formation of trapping devices and inhibited nematicidal activity. Notably, Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analysis indicated that the loss of Ccc1-mediated vacuolar iron storage occurred during the Late Paleozoic Ice Age, while the origin of the trapping devices and the acquisition of desferriferrichrome biosynthesis were strongly associated with significantly elevated temperatures. Temperature bioassays demonstrated that the formation of trapping devices is highly temperature-dependent, with free iron content in mycelial cells being inversely proportional to temperature, consistent with that A. oligospora is sensitive to high temperatures and fails to grow above 30{degrees}C. Our findings revealed that global temperature fluctuations are a crucial driver of the genetic evolution of NTFs, as a catalyst for the origin of trapping devices, which are a novel phenotypic indicator of eukaryotic iron overload.

Author summaryWe found that a unique group of carnivorous fungi has evolved specialized trapping devices to sequester excess iron, compensating for the absence of the crucial Ccc1-mediated vacuolar iron detoxification pathway, which is conserved in most fungi. Furthermore, we report for the first time that elevated temperature is a non-trophic factor that induces iron overload in eukaryotes, as iron content and composition in fungal mycelia are negatively correlated with temperature. Our findings suggest that nematode-trapping fungi could serve as a potential eukaryotic model for investigating the dynamic regulation mechanisms of iron homeostasis, which could contribute to the development of therapies for iron overload-related diseases in humans. In humans, iron overload leads to tissue damage, particularly in the cardiovascular system. It has long been assumed that iron overload occurs when iron intake is increased over an extended period, either through repeated red blood cell transfusions or enhanced absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Caucasians are particularly susceptible to iron overload and the complications of hemochromatosis due to a higher incidence of mutations in the homeostatic iron regulation gene within this population. The discovery of eukaryotes exhibiting an iron overload phenotype when exposed to heat holds significant implications for developing treatments and strategies for human iron overload disorders.",NA,biorxiv

Some of these changes are similar, leading to suggestions that pregnancy may be a model for aging. Recent studies using DNA methylation clocks showed apparent aging during gestation which resolves postpartum. Since aging and pregnancy are complex, it is important to compare them in terms of many physiological parameters and at many time points. Here, we analyzed cross-sectional data on 62 lab tests at weekly resolution in 300,000 pregnancies and 1.4 million nonpregnant females aged 20-80. We trained a regression model to predict age from lab tests. Apparent age dropped by 8 years in early pregnancy, rose by 30 years towards delivery, and recovered postpartum. Certain systems exhibited rejuvenation, with opposite trends in pregnancy and aging, including renal, iron, and most liver tests. Others, such as coagulation, thyroid, muscle, and metabolic systems, showed apparent aging. Some systems displayed mixed trends. Notably, in the systems that showed apparent aging, the physiological mechanisms for the changes differed between pregnancy and aging. Pregnancy complications led to an additional apparent aging of 4-8 years. We conclude that pregnancy has features of rejuvenation for some systems, but its aging-like features involve different mechanisms than true aging. Gestational rejuvenation-like mechanisms may offer clues for slowing aspects of biological aging.",NA,biorxiv

To do so, we develop a computational model for structural plasticity in the olfactory bulb and show that it is the maturation process of adult-born neurons that enables the bulb to learn quickly and forget slowly. Particularly important are the transient enhancement of the plasticity, excitability, and susceptibility to apoptosis that characterizes young neurons. The model captures many experimental observations and makes a number of testable predictions. Overall, it identifies memory consolidation as an important role of adult neurogenesis in olfaction and exemplifies how the brain can maintain stable memories despite ongoing extensive neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.",NA,biorxiv

Therefore, environments that facilitate adaptive behavioural plasticity could relax the strength of natural selection, but experimental evidence for this prediction remains scarce. Here, we first demonstrate that maternal care in the beetle Callosobruchus maculatus is dependent on reliable environmental cues that allow females to reduce larval competition via learning and informed oviposition choices. We show that this facilitation of maternal care relaxes selection against deleterious alleles in offspring. We further find that mothers of low genetic quality generally provide poorer care. However, when receiving reliable environmental cues, the increased opportunity for learning reduced genetic differences in maternal care, further relaxing selection against deleterious alleles. We use our data to illustrate how the identified link between learning of maternal care and the strength of natural selection can impact indirect genetic effects between mothers and offspring and the accumulation of cryptic genetic loads in populations inhabiting environments that differ in their predictability.",NA,biorxiv

We previously identified Gmnc as a critical fate determinant for P73+ CRs subtypes from the hem, septum and thalamic eminence. In Gmnc-/- mutants, P73+ CRs are initially produced, cover the telencephalic vesicle but undergo massive apoptosis resulting in their complete depletion at mid-corticogenesis. Here we investigated the consequence of such a CRs depletion on dorsal cortex lamination and hippocampal morphogenesis. We found preplate splitting occurs normally in Gmnc-/- mutants but is followed by defective radial migration arrest in the dorsal cortex, altered cellular organization in the lateral cortex, aberrant hippocampal progenitor proliferation resulting in abnormal CA1 folding and lack of vasculature development in the hippocampal fissure. We then performed conditional Reln deletion in P73+ CRs to evaluate its relative contribution and found that only radial migration defects were recapitulated.

Here, we demonstrate that SB431542, a selective TGF-{beta} receptor I (ALK5) inhibitor, exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 through unprecedented multitargeted mechanisms. Through comprehensive in vitro, and in silico analyses, we identified that SB431542 directly binds to SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and disrupt its canonical function in inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This interaction restored lysosomal acidification and normalized perinuclear LAMP-1 localization, significantly impairing virion assembly as evidenced by disrupted nucleocapsid-RNA association and reduced intracellular viral titers. Additionally, SB431542 downregulated the CLEAR network genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis, further restricting viral egress pathways. Our temporal analyses revealed that at later infection stages (36-48 hpi), SARS-CoV-2 exploits TGF-{beta}-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and apoptosis for viral release--processes effectively inhibited by SB431542 through suppression of GADD45b and BAX expression. These multiple mechanisms resulted in an exceptional EC50 of 515 nM against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in embryonated chicken eggs, where SB431542 conferred dose-dependent protection against lethal infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) challenge, with a favourable therapeutic index of 34.54. Remarkably, sequential passaging of SARS-CoV-2 for 50 generations under SB431542 selection pressure failed to generate resistant variants, contrasting sharply with the rapid resistance emergence typical of direct-acting antivirals. These findings establish SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor with a unique triple-mechanism approach that simultaneously targets viral entry via TGF-{beta}/Smad modulation, disrupts ORF3a-mediated lysosomal dysfunction affecting assembly, and attenuates TGF-{beta}-induced apoptosis during late-stage infection-- collectively imposing multiple selective constraints that impede escape mutation development.

ImportanceThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for antiviral drugs with high barriers to resistance. This study reveals that SB431542, a drug previously developed to inhibit TGF-{beta} signaling, exhibits remarkable effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 through an unprecedented triple-mechanism approach. Unlike conventional antivirals that target a single viral component, SB431542 simultaneously disrupts viral entry, assembly, and release by binding to the viral ORF3a protein and modulating host cellular processes. Most importantly, SARS-CoV-2 failed to develop resistance against SB431542 even after 50 generations of exposure--a significant advantage over current therapeutics that quickly lose effectiveness due to viral mutations. Our findings also uncover that coronaviruses exploit both lysosomal dysfunction and programmed cell death to spread efficiently, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention. This research establishes SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor and demonstrates the value of targeting host-virus interactions to overcome antiviral resistance.",NA,biorxiv

This turns 3D-into 2D data which is much easier to visualize, analyze, and computationally process. Tissue cartography has proven particularly useful in developmental biology by taking advantage of the sheet-like organization of many biological tissues. However, existing software tools for tissue cartography are limited in the type of geometries they can handle and difficult for non-experts to use and extend. Here, we describe blender_tissue_cartography (btc), a tissue cartography add-on for the popular 3D creation software Blender. btc makes tissue cartography user-friendly via a graphical user interface and harnesses powerful algorithms from the computer graphics community for biological image analysis. The btc GUI enables interactive analysis and visualization without requiring any programming expertise, while an accompanying Python library allows expert users to create custom analysis pipelines. Both the add-on and the Python library are highly modular and fully documented, including interactive Jupyter Notebook tutorials. btc features a general-purpose pipeline for time-lapse data in which the user graphically defines a cartographic projection for a single key frame, which is propagated to all other frames via surface-to-surface alignment algorithms. The btc differential geometry module allows mathematically correcting for cartographic distortion, enabling faithful 3D measurements in 2D cartographic projections, including for vector fields like tissue flow fields. We demonstrate btc on diverse and complex tissue shapes from Drosophila, stem-cell-based organoids, Arabidopsis, and zebrafish.",NA,biorxiv

However, the minimal conditions and factors sufficient to induce the caudal region, particularly in humans, remain unresolved. Here, we show that BMP4 alone, when administered at appropriate dosage, is sufficient to induce the formation of an organizer for caudal induction. This organizer induces caudal cell fate specification and morphogenesis in zebrafish embryos. In 3D human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) aggregates, BMP4 can induce an elongated embryonic structure characterized by caudal fates. Importantly, hPSCs instructed by BMP4 are sufficient to induce a secondary caudal region when grafted into the animal pole of the zebrafish embryo. Our study thus uncovers BMP4 as the inducer in the formation of a caudal organizer in the vertebrate embryo.

Significance statementWe demonstrate that BMP4 alone can induce the formation of a caudal organizer, a critical structure that guides the development of the caudal region in vertebrates. Using zebrafish embryos, embryonic explants, human pluripotent stem cell xenografts, and 3D human stem cell aggregates, we show that this organizer replicates morphogenesis and key differentiation pathways seen in natural development. Our findings uncover a novel role for BMP4 and define the minimal requirements for inducing this organizer, offering new insights into vertebrate development and potential applications in regenerative medicine.",NA,biorxiv

Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species, without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended. As a result, our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete. Here we provide new data showing that, in contrast to previous studies, species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. Thus, our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration -- passive accumulation -- that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins.

ResumenComprender los origenes de fenotipos novedosos y complejos es un objetivo central en biologia evolutiva. Las ranas venenosas de la familia Dendrobatidae han desarrollado una novedosa habilidad para adquirir alcaloides de su dieta como defensas quimicas, al menos tres veces. Sin embargo, el muestreo de taxones en busca de alcaloides ha estado sesgado hacia las especies coloridas, sin prestar atencion similar a las poco conspicuas que a menudo se presume, no tienen defensas. Como resultado, nuestra comprension de como evolucionan las defensas quimicas en este grupo es incompleta. Aqui, proporcionamos nuevos datos que muestran que, en contraste con estudios anteriores, las especies de cada clado de ranas venenosas no defendidas tienen cantidades bajas pero cuantificables de alcaloides. Confirmamos que los dendrobatidos no defendidos consumen regularmente acaros y hormigas, que son fuentes conocidas de alcaloides. Por lo tanto, nuestros datos sugieren que la dieta es insuficiente para explicar el fenotipo defendido. Nuestros datos respaldan la existencia de un fenotipo intermedio entre consumo y secuestro de toxinas (acumulacion pasiva), que difiere del secuestro en que no implica formas derivadas de mecanismos de transporte y almacenamiento, pero da lugar a bajos niveles de acumulacion de toxinas. Discutimos el concepto de acumulacion pasiva y su potencial rol en el origen de defensas quimicas en ranas venenosas y otros organismos que secuestran toxinas. Considerando ideas de farmacocinetica, incorporamos datos nuevos y antiguos de ranas venenosas dentro de un modelo evolutivo que podria ayudar a explicar los origenes de defensas quimicas adquiridas en animales, y proporcionar una vision de los procesos moleculares que regulan el destino de las toxinas ingeridas.",NA,biorxiv

MethodsAdMSCs were isolated from adipose tissue. Characterization and multipotency analyses were performed. Exosomes were isolated from the media of AdMSCs and then characterized. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from patients with BU and healthy individuals. AdMSCs were preincubated with or without IFN-{gamma} for 48 h. PBMC of patients with BU and healthy controls separately cultured with exosomes for 72 h. After the culture period, lymphocyte proliferation, viability, and apoptosis were carried out via flow cytometry. The expression of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-17, transforming growth factor (TGF)-{beta}, and interferon (IFN)-{gamma} levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

ResultsIFN+Exo promoted lymphocyte apoptosis in patients with BU. IFN+Exo suppressed cell viability of T lymphocytes of BU. Exosomes alone did not affect on T lymphocyte proliferation. Additionally, exosomes increased anti-inflammatory cytokine levels and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels of T lymphocytes in patients with BU.

Using genetically diverse inbred rat strains, we investigated operant oral oxycodone self-administration, identifying  Augmenter phenotypes that dramatically increased consumption during extended (16h vs. 4h) access--a vulnerability not predicted by standard motivation tests. A key innovation was applying lick microstructure analysis (LMA) to operationally distinguish  consumption from  seeking lick clusters within the inter-reward interval. During extended access, Augmenters of both sexes exhibited a striking surge in the frequency of both consumption and seeking clusters (p<0.0001), driving their escalated intake. Notably, female Augmenters also showed larger seeking cluster sizes (p=0.006), suggesting enhanced reward value specifically linked to seeking behavior. In contrast, interlick interval (a palatability measure) did not differentiate phenotypes. This LMA-based approach reveals that an increased drive to seek out additional oxycodone, rather than altered hedonic impact alone, underlies the augmentation of opioid intake, offering a nuanced rodent model of heightened vulnerability and a powerful tool to dissect reward dynamics.",NA,biorxiv

The lysine decarboxylase LdcI catalyses lysine-to-cadaverine conversion coupled to proton consumption and carbon dioxide release, thereby buffering cytoplasmic and extracellular pH. Our previous study showed that Escherichia coli LdcI forms intracellular patches under mild acid stress, and that at the corresponding acidic pH, purified LdcI polymerises into filaments, suggesting a potential role for polymerisation in its function. Here, we investigate the physiological relevance of LdcI filamentation in E. coli using 3D super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and a structure-based LdcI polymerisation-deficient E. coli mutant strain. We establish a semi-automated workflow for detection of clusters within a bacterial cell as well as quantitative analysis of their volume and localisation. We demonstrate that LdcI predominantly clusters at the cell periphery. We then show that disrupting LdcI polymerisation markedly reduces cluster size without significantly affecting localisation, suggesting that acid-stress induced LdcI clustering in vivo is driven by the enzymes filamentation. Growth and pH measurements reveal that the mutant strain exhibits reduced fitness and impaired extracellular buffering compared to the wild type, indicating that LdcI polymerisation enhances E. coli acid stress response. Our findings provide strong evidence that LdcI filamentation is a key regulatory feature of the E. coli capacity to counteract acid stress, optimising enzymatic activity by spatially organising LdcI within the cytoplasm. More broadly, this work adds to a growing body of evidence supporting the functional significance of metabolic enzyme self-assembly and its implications for bacterial stress adaptation.

Author summaryAmino acid decarboxylases confer enterobacteria the ability to survive under acidic conditions.

Escape from natural enemies in invaded regions (enemy release hypothesis, ERH) and increased competitive ability are hallmarks of invasive species; however, these two processes are rarely studied within the same context. Here, we examined the effect of enemy release on the competition outcomes of a successful invasive insect pest in North America, the African fig fly (Zaprionus indianus). Parasitoid wasps such as Leptopilina heterotoma that parasitize drosophilid larvae may seek out established species with known host suitability over a novel species, so we hypothesized Z. indianus may have low susceptibility to parasitoids, giving them a competitive advantage over co-occurring drosophilids. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the adult emergence rates from Z. indianus larvae reared alone or in competition with Drosophila hydei or D. simulans larvae in the presence and absence of parasitoid wasps under low and high larval densities. At low larval densities, Z. indianus emerged at equal rates to D. hydei but outcompeted D. simulans, and these outcomes were not affected by parasitoids. However, at high densities, the addition of parasitoids shifted competition outcomes in favor of Z. indianus, suggesting enemy release provides a competitive advantage under some circumstances. These results indicate that the strength of enemy release in Z. indianus is widely dependent on contextual factors such as density and competitor species. This study emphasizes how a community approach to testing the ERH is vital as the overall interpretation of the presence and strength of enemy release differed between intraspecific and interspecific experiments. Further investigation of how these results apply to field environments could offer insight into how Z. indianus alters ecosystems and how productive biological control may limit the spread of Z. indianus.

Short AbstractInvasive species may succeed in new environments in part because they are less susceptible to diseases and parasites that have co-evolved with local hosts, giving invaders a competitive advantage. We tested this hypothesis by competing an invasive fruit fly against established species in the presence of parasitoid wasps that lay their eggs in fruit fly larvae. We found that the invasive species generally outcompeted other species in the presence of parasitoids, but the extent of its advantage depended on the species it was competing against and the number of larvae present.",NA,biorxiv

It remains, however, poorly understood compared with single cell migration. Polymerization of branched actin by the RAC1-WAVE-Arp2/3 pathway is well established to power membrane protrusions at the front of migrating cells, but also to maintain cell junctions in epithelial monolayers. Here we performed a screen for novel regulators of collective cell migration by identifying genes associated with the RAC1-WAVE-Arp2/3 pathway at cell junctions using dependency maps and by inactivating these candidates using CRISPR/Cas9. In wound healing, MCF10A epithelial cells collectively migrate towards the free space in a coordinated manner. PKN2 knockout (KO) cells display decreased collective migration due to destabilization of adherens junctions, whereas MOB4 KO cells display increased collective migration with a swirling behavior. Upon wound healing, PKN2 relocalizes to lateral junctions and maintains coordinated migration in the monolayer, whereas MOB4 relocalizes to the front edge of cells migrating towards the wound. The role of MOB4 in controlling collective migration requires YAP1, since MOB4 KO cells fail to activate YAP1 and their phenotype is rescued by constitutively active YAP1. Together, our data reveal two complementary activities required for coordinating cells in collective migration.",NA,biorxiv

Recently, we discovered that during biosynthetic transport, the KIT mutant (KITmut) is retained in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it activates downstream molecules. This retention is dependent on the phospholipase C{gamma}2-protein kinase D2-PI4 kinase III{beta} (PLC{gamma}2-PKD2-PI4KIII{beta}) pathway, which KITmut activates at the Golgi/TGN. The activated cascade aberrantly recruits GGA1 and the {gamma}-adaptin subunit of AP1, resulting in KITmut retention in the Golgi/TGN. However, the precise mechanisms, including the mediators and effectors in the pathway, remain unclear. In humans, the phosphatidic acid-generating enzymes, phospholipase D1 (PLD1) and PLD2, are known downstream proteins of PKD. In the presence of the PLD inhibitor CAY10594, KITmut is released from the Golgi/TGN and subsequently degraded in lysosomes, leading to signal inactivation. Knockdown experiments indicated that PLD2 plays a role in KITmut retention. KITmut activates PLD2 through PKD2, but not PI4KIII{beta}, for Golgi/TGN retention. PLD activity is required for the association of {gamma}-adaptin with GGA1. Therefore, the KIT-PLC{gamma}2-PKD2 pathway separately activates PLD2 and PI4KIII{beta} to recruit {gamma}-adaptin and GGA1. Collectively, these results suggest that KITmut retention is dependent on the activation of the PLC{gamma}2-PKD2-PLD2 cascade in GIST.",NA,biorxiv

The emergence of high-throughput (HT) expansion of human stem-cell-derived cells and HT in vitro cellular assays for drug testing necessitate monitoring and understanding of the oxygenation conditions, yet virtually no data exists for such settings. For metabolically active cells like cardiomyocytes, variations in oxygenation may significantly impact their maturation and function; conversely, electromechanical activity can drive oxygen demands. We used HT label-free optical measurements and computational modeling to gain insights about oxygen availability (peri-cellular oxygen dynamics) in syncytia of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and human cardiac fibroblasts (cFB) grown in glass-bottom 96-well plates under static conditions. Our experimental results highlight the critical role of cell density and solution height (oxygen delivery path) in peri-cellular oxygen dynamics. The developed 3D reaction-diffusion model with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, trained on the obtained comprehensive data set, revealed that time-variant maximum oxygen consumption rate, Vmax, is needed to faithfully capture the complex peri-cellular oxygen dynamics in the excitable hiPSC-CMs, but not in the cFB. For the latter, accounting for cell proliferation was needed. Interestingly, we found both hypoxic (< 2%) and hyperoxic (> 7%) conditions can easily emerge in these standard HT plates in static culture and that peri-cellular oxygen dynamics evolves with days in culture. Our results and the developed computational model can directly be used to optimize cardiac cell growth in HT plates to achieve desired physiological conditions, important in cellular assays for cardiotoxicity, drug development, personalized medicine and heart regeneration applications.",NA,biorxiv

If so, then time spent in conversation over meals should affect the default network- a set of interconnected cortical regions reliably associated with the social exchange of ideas. To test this possibility, we combined passive-mobile sensing with neuroimaging. Undergraduate participants had an application on their smartphone for two months that unobtrusively captured their time spent in conversation, as well as their location on and around campus. In between these two months, participants completed a resting state scan. Time spent in conversations around meals (e.g., at cafeterias and restaurants) during the prior month predicted greater functional connectivity in the dorsomedial default network subsystem, specifically between the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) portion and the rest of the subsystem regions. This relationship was preferential to: (1) time spent in conversation over the past (vs. future) month, (2) connectivity with the LIFG (vs. other dorsomedial subsystem nodes), (3) the dorsomedial subsystem (vs. other default network subsystems), (4) eateries (vs. other locations), and (5) time spent around conversation at eateries, rather than time at eateries more generally.

Not only do TF concentrations fluctuate in time and from cell to cell, in each cell the actual binding and unbinding of TFs to promoters is also stochastic. However, how this  noise propagation from TFs to their targets determines the expression fluctuations in target genes of the same TF has so far not been quantitatively characterized. Here we use fluorescence time-lapse microscopy in combination with microfluidics and automated image analysis to quantitatively track the single-cell growth and gene expression dynamics of different target promoters of the LexA SOS response regulator in E. coli under mild DNA damage induced by the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP).

We find that, at the single-cell level, LexA target promoters exhibit stochastic bursts in protein production with specific quantitative characteristics. First, the durations of protein production bursts are short, identical for all promoters, and independent of CIP levels. Second, the heights of the production peaks are exponentially distributed for each promoter, and independent of CIP level, but with different average heights for different promoters. Third, the frequency of the production bursts increases with CIP level for all promoters, but differs across promoters.

Importantly, we show that these observations are inconsistent with popular  equilibrium models of bacterial gene regulation that assume that the dynamics of binding and unbinding of TFs is fast relative to the time-scale of TF concentration fluctuations. Instead, all observations can be quantitatively fit by a relatively simple model in which DNA damage events lead to short transient dips in LexA concentration, and an expression burst occurs in a cell whenever LexA unbinds from the target promoter during such a short dip in LexA concentration. Moreover, because these transient dips in LexA concentration occur on the same time-scale as the stochastic unbinding of LexA from promoters, the response of a target promoter to an individual DNA damage event is stochastic and depends in a complex manner on the strengths of its LexA binding sites and the duration of the event. Consequently, the expression levels of different LexA target genes in a given cell reflect distinct statistics of the frequency and durations of DNA damage events in the recent history of that cell.

Our results show that, even in the simple scenario where a single TF is induced, different target promoters can exhibit distinct stochastic responses that depend on the precise kinetics of the induction events.",NA,biorxiv

Pkf2p directly binds in a Mg-ATP-dependent manner to short GA-, UC-, AU- and U-rich motifs overrepresented in its mRNA targets.

In epithelial cancers, LRP2 expression is associated with a differentiated tumor cell state and better prognosis. In previous work, we found that while LRP2 is not expressed in benign naevi, it is frequently acquired in melanoma. However, the molecular drivers of LRP2 expression in melanoma and characteristics of LRP2-expressing melanoma have yet to be described. Here, we show that LRP2 expression is related to a transitory melanoma cell state defined by co-expression of melanocyte lineage and neural crest transcriptional programs. Further, we reveal that melanoma LRP2 expression is increased in T cell-inflamed tumors, and is directly upregulated through interferon-gamma signaling. Correlation of melanoma LRP2 expression with clinicopathological variables demonstrates that LRP2 expression is associated with low Breslow thickness and low clinical stage in primary melanomas. Taken together, the present study describes the characteristics of LRP2-expressing melanoma and reveals interferon gamma signaling as a novel strong positive regulator of LRP2 expression in melanoma.

SignificanceMelanoma cells often acquire LRP2 expression but the drivers of LRP2 expression in this setting and characteristics of LRP2-expressing melanoma remain unclear. Here, we show that LRP2 expression is related to a transitory melanoma differentiation cell state. Further, LRP2 expression in melanoma correlates with a T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment and LRP2 expression in melanoma cells can be directly increased by interferon-gamma. In addition, LRP2 expression is associated with less advanced histopathological characteristics of melanoma. These findings encourage future studies on LRP2 in settings with increased interferon signaling, in particular in melanoma metastases following immunotherapy.",NA,biorxiv

AAV-based approaches have several advantages over transgenic mouse lines, including ease of application to many different animal models without extensive crossing and their amenability to intersectional approaches. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of retinal ganglion cell types labeled by two AAV vectors drawn from a recent panel of constructs with synthetic promoters. Each promoter analyzed here was derived from a gene expressed in a cell type specific manner. Using a combination of morphology, molecular markers, and electrophysiological measurement of light responses, we found that each vector labeled distinct subsets of RGCs. However, both labeled more cell types than expected from the expression pattern of the promoters endogenous gene. We then characterized the projection patterns of these RGC types to the brain, finding that each AAV type labeled distinct axonal populations.

It plays an important role in several cellular processes through the modification of thousands of protein substrates. O-GlcNAcylation in humans is mediated by a single essential enzyme, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). OGT, together with the sole O-GlcNAcase OGA, form an intricate feedback loop to maintain O-GlcNAc homeostasis in response to changes in cellular O-GlcNAc using a dynamic mechanism involving nuclear retention of its fourth intron. However, the molecular mechanism of this dynamic regulation remains unclear. Using an O-GlcNAc responsive GFP reporter cell line, we identify SFSWAP, a poorly characterized splicing factor, as a trans-acting factor regulating OGT intron detention. We show that SFSWAP is a global regulator of retained intron splicing and exon skipping that primarily acts as a negative regulator of splicing. In contrast, knockdown of SFSWAP leads to reduced inclusion of a  decoy exon present in the OGT retained intron which may mediate its role in OGT intron detention. Global analysis of decoy exon inclusion in SFSWAP and UPF1 double knockdown cells indicate altered patterns of decoy exon usage. Together, these data indicate a role for SFSWAP as a global negative regulator of pre-mRNA splicing and positive regulator of intron retention.",NA,biorxiv

Despite nearly a century of research, the computations underlying this projection have not been adequately addressed. In the present study, we employed model-driven psychophysics to fill this gap. We hypothesized that tool-based sensory projection involves the remapping of touch from sensory feedback in the hand into an egocentric coordinate system. We first formalized the computational steps underlying tactile remapping. We designed a novel tool-sensing experiment that allowed us to rigorously test this model. In this task, participants contacted an object with a hand-held rod and then judged whether the object was above or below where they were currently looking. This comparison would only be possible if touch on the tool was projected outside the hand. Crucially, both object location and gaze position varied independently, allowing us to characterize the hand-to-space-to-gaze remapping process. Model-based curve fitting provided strong evidence that all participants in our task projected touch outside their body and into gazecentered coordinates. Crucially, the resolution of this projection was similar to what has been found for touch on the body.

Pangenome fluidity has been attributed to adaptive evolution, yet the underlying ecological drivers for bacterial pathogens persisting in natural reservoirs remain poorly understood. Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), a foodborne pathogen causing fatal listeriosis, serves as an ideal model for investigating the ecological mechanisms underlying pangenome fluidity in bacterial pathogens due to its high evolutionary divergence, broad ecological versatility, and significant public health concern. Through pangenome analysis of 177 Lm isolates representing three evolutionary lineages (I, II, and III) that we isolated from soils across the United States, we found that substantial genome variation was strongly associated with climatic factors (e.g. precipitation and temperature), soil properties (e.g. aluminum, pH, and molybdenum), and bacterial community composition, particularly Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, Acidobacteria, and Cyanobacteria. These factors exerted selective pressure across many gene functions, with pronounced effects on genes involved in cell envelope synthesis, defense mechanisms, and replication, recombination, and repair. Among Lm lineages occupying varied habitats, distinct pangenome properties were observed. Lineage III exhibited a highly fluid pangenome, which was attributed to local adaptation to nutrient-limited conditions and strong dispersal limitation. In contrast, lineage I maintained a conserved pangenome, likely due to frequent homogenizing dispersal. Consistent with these dispersal patterns, we identified an elevated risk of soil-to-human transmission in lineage I, evidenced by epidemiological links between three soil-derived and 17 clinical isolates. Collectively, this study reveals the pivotal role of environmental selection imposed by both abiotic factors and bacterial communities in governing the adaptive pangenome evolution in bacterial pathogens. It also highlights significant differences in pangenome flexibility, ecological niches, and transmission dynamics across lineages of the same pathogen species, underscoring the need for tailored source tracking strategies.

AUTHOR SUMMARYStudying the full set of genes found in different strains of a bacterium (i.e. pangenome) helps us understand how bacterial pathogens develop and adapt to changes in the environment. Here, we focused on Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), a pathogen capable of spreading through food and surviving in diverse environments, to understand how environmental factors and the way that bacteria move across locations can influence the pangenome content in this important bacterium. By analyzing the genomes of 177 Lm strains representing three evolutionary lineages (I, II, and III) collected from soils across the United States, we found that variation in climate, soil chemistry, and surrounding bacteria (e.g., Nitrospirae) was closely linked to genetic differences among strains. These environmental conditions seemed to affect genes that help build the cell envelop, protect the bacteria from harm, and fix damaged DNA. We also observed different levels of genome flexibility across Lm lineages which were found to be related to how they move across different locations. Lineage III showed evidence of barriers to spreading, which may enhance genetic differentiation across populations, leading to a more flexible pangenome. In contrast, lineage I appeared to spread more readily and was epidemiologically linked to human clinical cases, which may facilitate genetic exchange that reduce pangenome diversity. This study shows that both non-living environmental conditions--like precipitation and pH--and nearby groups of bacteria play a big role in shaping how bacterial pathogens change their genes to survive. It also highlights that different subtypes of the same pathogen can have different gene flexibility and spread in different ways, calling for specific biocontrol measures.",NA,biorxiv

HIV-1-infected macrophages develop a unique intracellular compartment termed the virus-containing compartment (VCC) that exhibits characteristic markers of the late endosome and is enriched in components of the plasma membrane (PM). The VCC has been proposed as the major site of particle assembly in macrophages. Depleting Siglec-1 from macrophages significantly reduces VCC formation, implying a link between the capture and endocytosis of external HIV-1 particles and the development of VCCs within HIV-infected cells. We found that endocytosis of particles to the VCC was independent of clathrin, but required dynamin-2. CD98 and CD44, classical markers of the CLIC/GEEC pathway, colocalized with Siglec-1 and HIV-1 particles within the VCC. Inhibition of CLIC/GEEC-mediated endocytosis by chemical or genetic means resulted in the arrest of captured HIV-1 particles on the macrophage cell surface and prevented VCC formation. Virus-like particles (VLPs) were taken up within CD98 and Siglec-1-enriched tubular membranes that migrated centripetally over time to form VCC-like structures. These findings indicate that following capture of virus by Siglec-1, particles follow an endocytic route to the VCC that requires both the CLIC/GEEC pathway and dynamin-2. We propose a model in which internalization of HIV-1 particles together with CLIC/GEEC membranes leads to the formation of the VCC in HIV-infected macrophages, creating an intracellular platform that facilitates further particle assembly and budding.

Author SummaryThe major cell types infected by HIV are CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Infection of macrophages is of great interest because this cell type can contribute to transmission of virus within tissues, and because infected macrophages contribute to HIV-related complications that include neurologic disorders, endocrine disorders, and cardiovascular disease. HIV infection of macrophages may also create a latent reservoir that persists in infected individuals despite administration of antiretroviral therapy. Here we focused on a compartment that forms in HIV-infected macrophages termed the virus-containing compartment or VCC. The VCC is an intracellular compartment that has been described as a site of assembly and as a holding compartment for viruses, and contains components of both intracellular organelles and the plasma membrane. We identified an endocytosis pathway that helps to explain the origins of the VCC, the CLIC/GEEC pathway. Inhibition of the CLIC/GEEC pathway prevented virus-like particle delivery to the VCC and prevented the VCC from forming in HIV-infected macrophages. The GTPase dynamin-2 was also required for delivery of HIV particles to the VCC. This study identifies a new facet of how HIV interacts with macrophages, suggesting that disruption of this pathway could be a therapeutic strategy with implications for HIV cure efforts.",NA,biorxiv

The size of protein models and datasets has grown exponentially in recent years. However, the quality of protein knowledge and model training has suffered from the lack of accurate and efficient data annotation and cleaning methods. To address this challenge, we introduce ProtAC, which corrects large Protein datasets with a scalable Automatic Cleaning framework that leverages both sequence and functional information through multimodal learning. To fulfill data cleaning, we propose the Sequence-Annotation Matching (SAM) module in the model, which filters the functional annotations that are more suitable for the corresponding sequences. Our approach is a cyclic process consisting of three stages: first pretraining the model on a large noisy dataset, then finetuning the model on a small manually annotated dataset, and finally cleaning the noisy dataset using the finetuned model. Through multiple rounds of ""train-finetune-clean"" cycles, we observe progressive improvement in protein function prediction and sequenceannotation matching. As a result, we achieve (1) a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model that outperforms competitors with fewer than 100M parameters, evaluated on multiple function-related downstream tasks, and (2) a cleaned UniRef50 dataset containing [~]50M proteins with well-annotated functions.

For the first time, we demonstrate that membrane conductivity is determined by both ion permeability and the harmonic mean of intramembrane ion concentration, bridging the gap between the permeability-based Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) model and conductance-based models. We characterize the rectification properties of GABAA, AMPA, and leaky channels by estimating their single-channel permeabilities and conductance. By integrating these rectifying channels into neurodynamic models, our GNP neurodynamic model reveals how electrodiffusive dynamics fundamentally shape neural firing by modulating membrane conductance and the interplay between passive and active ion transport-mechanisms that are often overlooked in conventional conductance-based neurodynamic models.

While its role in plant defence has been investigated for decades, regulation of plant growth and development has only come into focus recently. It has been demonstrated that SA application inhibits growth independently of the established Non-expressor of Pathogenesis Related (NPR) receptors. However, the underlying mechanism of this growth inhibition on the cellular level remains largely elusive. Here we show that SA restricts cell elongation and induces changes of vacuolar morphology and pH. Rapidly upon SA application we observe homotypic vacuole fusion and a significant increase in vacuolar pH. These changes seem to be independent of the phytohormone auxin which has been reported to crosstalk with SA. By increasing vacuolar pH, SA directly impacts basic cellular functions such as vesicle trafficking or nutrient storage, leading eventually to cell size restriction and limited growth. Our results demonstrate an NPR-independent mechanism to attenuate growth, potentially allowing free resources to be relocated to withstand environmental stresses.

Nevertheless, substantial challenges remain in determining the association between gene-metabolite pairs due to the non-linear and multifactorial interactions within cellular networks.

FindingsHere, we introduce Compounds And Transcripts Bridge (abbreviated as CAT Bridge, available at https://catbridge.work), a free user-friendly platform for longitudinal multi-omics analysis to efficiently identify transcripts associated with metabolites using time-series omics data.

In this work, we conducted functional connectivity and graph theory analysis of fMRI data from a sample of neurotypical adolescents (N = 26) and a sample of adolescent NF1 - participants (N = 43). Whole brain comparisons demonstrated that during working memory conditions NF1 participants have greater connectivity in left posterior parietal regions, particularly converging at the postcentral gyrus. Comparison of communication between functional networks demonstrated that NF1 participants have increased connectivity between visual, sensorimotor, dorsal attention and limbic networks. Individual connections were weaker in NF1 participants across the brain, and we found reduced connectivity between control, dorsal attention and default networks in NF1. Furthermore, connectivity strength in these networks was predictive of accuracy and response time in NF1 participants during the task performance. Finally, graph theory analysis showed that working memory demands evoked reorganisation towards greater assortativity in NF1 participants, which was predictive of poorer accuracy and accuracy-speed trade-off. These findings highlight that NF1 participants working memory deficits emerge from reduced engagement of executive processes, and NF1 participants demonstrate coping mechanisms such as enhanced sensorimotor processing and network reorganisation towards greater segregation, that is however detrimental to cognitive performance.",NA,biorxiv

We find that in the absence pressure, the lipid flow drives the membrane into a spherical shape or a parachute shape. The shapes over time exhibit self-similarity. The presence of pressure transforms the membrane into a tubular shape that elongates almost linearly with time and the self-similarity between shapes at different times is lost.

While genomic alterations have been extensively studied in B-ALL, the role of pseudogenes remains largely unexplored due to their historical classification as non-functional sequences. However, recent evidence suggests that pseudogenes may play regulatory roles in cancer. Our previous work identified changes in pseudogene connectivity in B-ALL bone marrow samples compared to normal samples, with specific pseudogene clusters being overexpressed in the malignant phenotype. These findings suggest that pseudogene co-expression patterns may contain biologically and clinically relevant information. To evaluate the role of the coexpression between pseudogenes in B-ALL and its impact on patient outcomes, we constructed single-sample co-expression networks (SSNs) using RNA-seq data from two independent B-ALL cohorts (n = 1,416). Unsupervised clustering of these networks revealed patient subgroups with distinct overall survival (OS) profiles. Differential co-expression and network topology analyses identified EEF1A1P12 as a central hub, with its coordination state potentially influencing OS. Specifically, distinct co-expression patterns between EEF1A1P12 and EEF1A1P4 were associated with significant survival differences. To translate these findings into a predictive framework, we developed a novel pipeline leveraging co-expression biomarkers for survival risk stratification. This approach identified the interaction between RPL7P10 and RPS3AP36 as a robust classifier for B-ALL patient survival. Our results establish pseudogene co-expression as a key molecular feature in B-ALL, with implications for patient stratification and prognostic modeling.

Traditional diagnostic criteria for SBS include subdural, subarachnoid, and retinal hemorrhages. While intentional shaking is a known cause, the potential for similar forces acting on the head resulting from accidental trauma has not been fully explored. This study investigates the biomechanical forces on a model infants head during improper handling to determine if such forces could contribute to SBS without malicious intent.

MethodsA realistic silicone infant model was equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to quantify head accelerations during two conditions: (1) placement of the infant model on a table with the head unsupported, and (2) manual shaking at maximum effort by 2 participants holding the model by the torso. Peak head accelerations were recorded for both conditions, and the results were analyzed for comparative assessment of the forces involved.

ResultsThe average peak head acceleration when placing the infant model on a table with the head unsupported was +30,952.67 {+/-} 6,540.79 mg, with a range of +19,234.40 to +43,406.30 mg across trials. The average peak head accelerations during maximum effort shaking were significantly lower than placing the infant on the table, averaging 11,430.48 {+/-} 9,539.06,867 vs. 30,952.67 {+/-} 6,540.79 mg, p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in head accelerations between participants when placing the infant model on the table with the head unsupported (p = 0.93) nor with shaking the baby with maximum effort (p = 0.97).

DiscussionThe G-force in this study resulted in higher forces than experienced in an 18-mph car crash and a 5-mph bumper car collision. The study highlights that even accidental non-recommended handling of infants can result in high G-forces to the head, potentially leading to injuries similar to those observed in SBS. These findings highlight the necessity of supporting an infants head during handling and warrants caution against prematurely attributing physical abuse in SBS cases without considering unintentional causes.",NA,biorxiv

While HD pathogenesis has traditionally been attributed to the toxic gain-of-function effects of mutant huntingtin (mHTT), increasing evidence underscores the critical role of wild-type HTT loss-of-function. Understanding the physiological roles of HTT is essential for elucidating HD mechanisms and developing effective therapeutic strategies. The C. elegans htt-1 gene, an ortholog of human HTT, remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that htt-1 promotes survival under stress conditions that requires autophagy as a defense mechanism. Specifically, we identify intestinal htt-1 as a key regulator of C. elegans survival during Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 infection. Our findings reveal that htt-1 functions downstream of the MPK-1/ERK pathway to induce systemic autophagy and enhance host defense during immune challenges. Moreover, expression of wild-type human HTT in htt-1 mutant worms rescues the survival defect during PA14 infection. Expression of mutant human HTT, on the other hand, exacerbates survival deficits, underscoring the conserved function of HTT across species. Additionally, we found that htt-1 affects survival and autophagy under heat shock stress conditions. These results establish htt-1 as a critical regulator of survival and autophagy in response to both pathogenic bacterial infection and thermal stress.

Author summaryHuntingtin plays essential roles in selective autophagy across various organisms, including Drosophila, mice, and humans. Notably, the C. elegans huntingtin ortholog, htt-1, remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we describe a novel pro-survival role htt-1 in stress resistance. We show that htt-1 mutants exhibit significantly reduced survival during Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Expression of wild-type human HTT rescues the reduced survival of htt-1 mutants, whereas mutant HTT further exacerbates the phenotype. These findings establish C. elegans htt-1 as a valuable model for studying huntingtin biology and its roles in stress resistance. Downregulation of ERK in htt-1 mutants had no additional effect on survival, suggesting that htt-1 functions downstream of ERK. Interestingly, htt-1 mutants display reduced autophagy, indicating that htt-1 functions in the ERK-autophagy signaling cascade during infection. Mechanistically, we propose that htt-1 regulates autophagy at the protein level. HTT-1 remains cytoplasmic, and autophagy-related gene transcripts remain stable, without downregulation, in htt-1 mutants following infection. Additionally, htt-1 mutants exhibit reduced survival and impaired autophagy under heat stress. These results suggest that htt-1 may have a broader role in stress resilience extending beyond immune defense.",NA,biorxiv

P. gingivalis growth can be stimulated by 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA), a menaquinone precursor from various oral bacteria, yet its impact on biofilm formation remains unclear. The aim of the study was to evaluate P. gingivalis growth and metabolic activity over six days in response to DHNA on two titanium grade IV surfaces with different roughness using a hybrid in vitro - in silico approach. P. gingivalis growth was modestly stimulated by DHNA and exhibited an inverse correlation with ammonia concentration in culture medium. Notably, this growth pattern transitioned from an initial linear phase to a later exponential phase, with DHNA-treated biofilms reaching this exponential shift at an earlier stage than untreated controls. Confocal microscopy revealed that DHNA-treated biofilms exhibited surface-dependent growth patterns, with larger biofilm volumes observed on rougher surfaces in later biofilm stages, compared to smoother surfaces. Regardless of surface characteristics, the area occupied by biofilms and the size of the aggregates exhibited a consistent and progressive increase over time and was larger in late DHNA-treated biofilms. The experimental data were used to calibrate a coupled finite element method (FEM)-based model that simulated P. gingivalis biofilm dynamics and nutrient utilization. Summarizing, DHNA moderately stimulated P. gingivalis growth, accelerated its transition to ammonia-independent growth, and promoted an increase in biofilm area and aggregate size. Our coupled approach offers significant potential for advancing in vitro biofilm research. Importance: Results of our hybrid in vitro - in silico experiments advance the research on P. gingivalis physiology and its DHNA-dependent colonization of implant surfaces. Our findings reveal that DHNA accelerates P. gingivalis growth, induces aggregation and promotes colonization of titanium surfaces. For the first time, DHNA-induced P. gingivalis growth acceleration and an earlier shift away from ammonia dependency were observed fluorometrically, highlighting ammonia assimilation as a promising marker of P. gingivalis physiology during early biofilm expansion. Understanding how growth factors together with surface properties influence P. gingivalis colonization offers a basis for future preventive strategies. Our study's stringent characterization of 3D surface texture parameters is expected to improve reproducibility of biofilm-surface interactions experiments. The findings were validated using a continuum-based in silico model, initiating a hybrid approach where computational models complement in vitro research. Our interdisciplinary approach offers a versatile framework for investigating additional aspects of oral biofilms on titanium.",NA,biorxiv

To address this gap, we used the mustard-feeding drosophilid fly Scaptomyza flava, which feeds on toxic Brassicales plants like wasabi that produce noxious, electrophilic isothiocyanates (ITCs or mustard oils). We found that S. flava exhibits dramatically reduced behavioral sensitivity to allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) compared to its microbe-feeding relatives Scaptomyza pallida and Drosophila melanogaster. We hypothesized that molecular evolution of the ""wasabi receptor"" TRPA1, known to detect ITCs in flies, could explain this loss of aversion. Our experiments revealed three interconnected evolutionary genetic changes consistent with this hypothesis. First, TRPA1 was expressed in labellar tissues of S. flava at the lowest levels among the three species, at a nearly four-fold lower level than in D. melanogaster. Second, S. flava expressed a higher proportion of TRPA1 splice variants previously reported to be less sensitive to chemical stimulus. Third, we identified amino acid substitutions in S. flava that could influence the structure of intracellular domains of TRPA1. To test the functional salience of these mechanisms in vitro and in vivo, we validated TRPA1 splicing isoforms using Xenopus oocyte electrophysiology and the GAL4/UAS system in D. melanogaster. Single TRPA1 isoform electrophysiology in vitro revealed evolution of the channel in the S. flava lineage towards reduced electrophile sensitivity. Ectopic expression of S. flava TRPA1 in D. melanogaster also consistently conferred weaker AITC sensitivity in vivo than expression of its orthologues, although this did not fully recapitulate differences in wild-type phenotypes between species, suggesting other molecular mechanisms were involved. To address this, we explored the consequences of isoform co-expression using oocyte electrophysiology. We found that enrichment of electrophile-insensitive TRPA1 splicing isoforms as observed in the salient S. flava sensory organs additively reduced cellular responses to AITC, which could further contribute to reduced electrophile aversion. Our findings illuminate how expression differences, protein structural changes, and especially alternative splicing, together can drive sensory evolution as animals behaviorally adapt to toxic new niches.",NA,biorxiv

Traditionally, proteotoxic stress responses were studied as acute reactions to various noxious factors; however, recent evidence reveals that many proteostasis genes exhibit [~]12h ultradian rhythms under physiological conditions in mammals, driven by an XBP1s-dependent 12h oscillator. By examining the chromatin landscape of this oscillator, we identified RBBP5 as an essential epigenetic regulator of global proteostasis dynamics. Mechanistically, as the core subunit of the SET1/COMPASS complex, RBBP5 co-activates XBP1s to facilitate dynamic proteostasis gene expression by marking promoter-proximal H3K4me3, which further recruits the Integrator Complex and SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers. Functionally, RBBP5 is indispensable for regulating both the 12h oscillator and acute transcriptional response to various proteotoxic stresses, including ER stress and nutrient deprivation. RBBP5 ablation causes increased susceptibility to proteotoxic stress, chronic inflammation, and hepatic steatosis in mice, along with impaired autophagy and reduced cell survival in vitro. In humans, lower RBBP5 expression is associated with reduced adaptive stress-response gene expression and hepatic steatosis. Our findings not only highlight a previously unrecognized epigenetic timing mechanism distinct from circadian regulation but also establish RBBP5 as a central regulator of proteostasis, essential for cellular resilience and organismal health.

We show that desiccation inflicts oxidative damage and activates Mtbs DNA repair responses but that this repair is imperfect and results in mutations. We further show that activation of these DNA repair responses is accompanied by increased expression of the transcription-coupled repair factor, mfd, but that this expression serves to buffer the fitness cost of specific resistance-conferring mutations in rpoB, the target of the frontline drug rifampin, rather than to facilitate transcription-coupled DNA repair. Silencing mfd during aerosolization impairs survival of strains harboring the rifampin resistance allele S450L.

FOXP1-regulated genes may contribute to genetic risk of SCZ and this may vary across different stages of neurodevelopment. We analyzed transcriptomic data from mouse and human models of FOXP1 loss-of-function across prenatal and postnatal developmental stages, including neural stem cells from embryonic mice (E14.5) and human brain organoids (equivalent to second trimester), and cortical tissues from different mouse postnatal stages P0, P7, and P47. P0 in mice corresponds to the third trimester in humans, while P7 and P47 represent early childhood and adolescence, respectively. The effect of FOXP1 disruption on gene expression in cortical tissues/cells was assayed using RNA-seq, including time-course and pairwise gene expression analysis. Linkage disequilibrium score regression assessed if FOXP1-regulated genes were enriched for SCZ heritability. Gene-set enrichment analysis investigated if FOXP1-regulated genes were enriched for SCZ-associated genes reported as differentially expressed in single cortical cell studies. SynGO analysis mapped FOXP1-regulated genes to synaptic locations and functions. FOXP1-regulated genes are enriched for SCZ heritability, with significant results for E14.5, P7 and P47 but not P0. The P7 gene-set showed the strongest enrichment for SCZ-associated genes from single cortical cell studies. FOXP1-regulated genes at both P7 and P47 were involved in multiple synaptic functions and were mainly enriched within glutamatergic excitatory neurons, with P47 also showing enrichment within GABAergic inhibitory neurons across regions of the postnatal cortex. Prenatal FOXP1-regulated genes were enriched in progenitor cells and also mapped to the synapse. Genetic risk for SCZ within FOXP1-regulated genes follows a dynamic trajectory across developmental stages, showing stronger effects at timepoints that map to early childhood, followed by adolescence and second trimester.

Author SummarySchizophrenia is a complex disorder caused by many genes. While existing treatments can help manage some positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, they are not effective in treating other life-limiting symptom areas. As a result, individuals with schizophrenia continue to face significant challenges, including disability, unemployment, homelessness, and social isolation. Genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia have been effective at identifying individual SNPs and genes that contribute to these phenotypes but have struggled to immediately uncover the bigger picture of the underlying biology of the disorder. Here we take an individual gene associated with schizophrenia risk, FOXP1, which is an important regulator of brain development. Using functional genomics data from models where FOXP1 has been disrupted, we identified sets of genes regulated by FOXP1 across different developmental stages, focusing on the cortical region of the brain. Our findings reveal that FOXP1-regulated genes are most strongly associated with schizophrenia during early childhood and adolescence. These genes are associated with synaptic components, including presynaptic and postsynaptic structures. By integrating developmental timing, cell type specificity, and functional pathways, this study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying schizophrenia.",NA,biorxiv

However, current methods to identify adaptive variation have two major limitations. First, when estimating genetic variation, most methods do not account for observational uncertainty in genetic data because of finite sampling and missing genotypes. Second, current methods use phenomenological models to partition genetic variation into adaptive and non-adaptive components. These phenomenological models are not mechanistic models of evolution and, therefore, do not faithfully capture the demographic history of the species.
C_LIO_LIWe address these limitations by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model that explicitly accounts for both the observational uncertainty and underlying evolutionary processes. The first layer of the hierarchy is the data model that captures observational uncertainty by probabilistically linking RAD-sequence data to genetic variation. The second layer is a process model that provides a mechanistic explanation of how evolutionary forces, such as local adaptation, mutation, migration, and drift, maintain genetic variation. The third layer is the parameter model, which incorporates our knowledge about biological processes. For example, because most loci in the genome are expected to be neutral, the environmental sensitivity coefficients are assigned a regularized prior centered at zero. Together, the three models provide a rigorous probabilistic framework to identify local adaptation in wild organisms.
C_LIO_LIAnalysis of simulated RAD-seq data shows that our statistical model can reliably infer adaptive genetic variation. To show the real-world applicability of our method, we re-analyzed RAD-seq data from Willow Flycatchers (Empidonax traillii) in the USA.

In particular, the internally-oriented networks like the default network (DN) and externally-oriented dorsal attention networks (dATNs) are thought to be globally competitive, which implies DN disengagement during cognitive states that drive the dATNs and vice versa. If these networks are globally opposed, how is internal and external information integrated across these networks? Here, using precision neuroimaging methods, we show that these internal/external networks are not as dissociated as traditionally thought. Using densely sampled high-resolution fMRI data, we defined individualized whole-brain networks from participants at rest, and the retinotopic preferences of individual voxels within these networks during an independent visual mapping task. We show that while the overall network activity between the DN and dATN is opponent at rest, a latent retinotopic code structures this global opponency. Specifically, the anti-correlation (i.e., global opponency) between the DN and dATN at rest is structured at the voxel-level by each voxels retinotopic preferences, such that the spontaneous activity of voxels preferring similar visual field locations are more anti-correlated than those that prefer different visual field locations. Further, this retinotopic scaffold integrates with the domain-specific preferences of subregions within these networks, enabling efficient, parallel processing of retinotopic and domain-specific information. Thus, DN and dATN dynamics are opponent, but not competitive: voxel-scale anti-correlation between these networks preserves and encodes information in the negative BOLD responses, even in the absence of visual input or task demands. These findings suggest that retinotopic coding may serve as a fundamental organizing principle for brain-wide communication, providing a new framework for understanding how the brain balances and integrates internal cognition with external perception.",NA,biorxiv

While mechanical forces like actomyosin purse-string contraction and directional cell crawling have been implicated in driving HNP closure, how these forces organize local cell shape and motion to produce large-scale tissue remodeling remains poorly understood. Using live and fixed imaging of mouse embryos combined with cell-based biophysical modeling, we show that these force-generating mechanisms are insufficient to explain the robust patterns of cell elongation and nematic alignment observed at the HNP border. Instead, we show that local anisotropic stress and cytoskeletal organization are required to generate these patterns and promote midline cell motion. Our model captures key features of cell shape dynamics and emergent nematic order, which we confirm experimentally, including the alignment of actin fibers with cell shape and enhanced midline cell speed. Comparative analysis with chick embryos, which lack supracellular purse-strings, supports a conserved link between tension generation and cellular patterning. These findings establish a physical framework connecting force generation, cell shape anisotropy, and tissue morphodynamics during epithelial gap closure.",NA,biorxiv

In patients carrying pathogenic variations affecting splicing, the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) offers immense therapeutic hope. In this study, we develop a framework combining the use of patient-derived cells and kidney organoids to provide evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of ASOs in XLAS patients. Using multiomics analysis, we describe the development of GBM in wild-type and mutated human kidney organoids. We show that GBM maturation is a dynamic process, which requires long organoid culture. Then, using semi-automated quantification of 5(IV) at basement membranes in organoids carrying the splicing variants identified in patients, we demonstrate the efficacy of ASO treatment for 5(IV) restoration.

This study examined microbialites from the peritidal zone of three tide pools at Fongchueisha, Hengchun, Taiwan, to investigate the impact of salinity on microbial community composition and carbonate precipitation mechanisms. Microbial samples were collected across varying salinity gradients over multiple timepoints and analyzed using next-generation sequencing of bacterial 16S and eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes. Our findings reveal that the microbial communities in higher salinity environments exhibited significant shifts, with increased relative abundance of ureolytic bacteria and ammonifying microorganisms, such as Myxococcota and Actinobacteriota. This suggests the presence of diverse microbial carbonate precipitation mechanisms beyond photosynthesis, including ureolysis and ammonification. Furthermore, our results show that changes in the composition of cyanobacteria and diatoms were influenced by salinity, with heterocystous cyanobacteria (e.g., Nostocales) dominating low-salinity environments, and non-heterocystous cyanobacteria (e.g., Synechococcales) prevailing in higher salinity environments. Functional predictions reveal that microbial communities in high-salinity environments were enriched in anaerobic metabolic pathways, including pyruvate fermentation and the urea cycle. These findings highlight the significant role of salinity in influencing microbial composition and metabolic pathways, shaping carbonate precipitation processes in microbialites.

ImportanceThe study focuses on the impact of environmental salinity on microbial community composition and carbonate precipitation mechanisms within modern microbialites, based on an analysis of samples from three tide pools with different salinity levels collected at five time points throughout the year. Using next-generation sequencing of bacterial 16S and eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes, we identified key shifts in microbial communities along salinity gradients and explored diverse microbial processes involved in carbonate precipitation.

However, our understanding of the dynamic neural mechanisms that underlie congruency effects are under-explored. Using MEG, we examine how the congruency between an object and a prior scene results in changes in the oscillatory activity in the brain, which regions underpin this effect, and whether congruency results arise from top-down or bottom-up modulations of connectivity. We observed that prior scene information impacts the processing of visual objects in behaviour, neural activity and connectivity. Processing objects that were incongruent with the prior scene resulted in slower reaction times, increased low frequency activity in the ventral visual pathway, and increased top-down connectivity from the anterior temporal lobe to the posterior ventral temporal cortex. Our results reveal that the recurrent dynamics within the ventral visual pathway are modulated by the prior knowledge imbued by our surrounding environment, suggesting that the way we recognise objects is fundamentally linked to their context.",NA,biorxiv

Nonlinear dynamics theory has been successfully utilized in explaining brain functions from a biophysics standpoint, and the field of statistical physics continues to make substantial progress in understanding brain connectivity and function. This study delves into complex brain functional connectivity using biophysical nonlinear dynamics approaches. We aim to uncover hidden information in high-dimensional and nonlinear neural signals, with the hope of providing a useful tool for analyzing information transitions in functionally complex networks. By utilizing phase portraits and fuzzy recurrence plots, we investigated the latent information in the functional connectivity of complex brain networks. Our numerical experiments, which include synthetic linear dynamics neural time series and a biophysically realistic neural mass model, showed that phase portraits and fuzzy recurrence plots are highly sensitive to changes in neural dynamics and can also be used to predict functional connectivity based on structural connectivity. Furthermore, the results showed that phase trajectories of neuronal activity encode low-dimensional dynamics, and the geometric properties of the limit-cycle attractor formed by the phase portraits can be used to explain the neurodynamics. Additionally, our results showed that the phase portrait and fuzzy recurrence plots can be used as functional connectivity descriptors, and both metrics were able to capture and explain nonlinear dynamics behavior during specific cognitive tasks. In conclusion, our findings suggest that phase portraits and fuzzy recurrence plots could be highly effective as functional connectivity descriptors, providing valuable insights into nonlinear dynamics in the brain.

SignificanceHere we report that phase trajectories and fuzzy recurrence plots can serve as descriptors of nonlinear functional dynamics networks. Both metrics are highly sensitive to variations in neural signals and are powerful tools for capturing distinct patterns from brain signals, making brain fingerprinting possible. This has significant implications for understanding brain state dynamics through phase trajectories and fuzzy recurrence plots, as both metrics are effective in identifying nonlinear dynamics patterns.",NA,biorxiv

As a result, these phylogenetic data are an incredibly valuable resource for science and public health. However, the vast majority of the data was sequenced by tiling amplicons across the full genome, with amplicon schemes that changed over the pandemic as mutations in the viral genome interacted with primer binding sites. In combination with the disparate set of genome assembly workflows and lack of consistent quality control (QC) processes, the current genomes have many systematic errors that have evolved with the virus and amplicon schemes. These errors have significant impacts on the phylogeny, and therefore over the last few years, many thousands of hours of researchers time has been spent in ""eyeballing"" trees, looking for artefacts, and then patching the tree.

Given the huge value of this dataset, we therefore set out to reprocess the complete set of public raw sequence data in a rigorous amplicon-aware manner, and build a cleaner phylogeny.

The size, shape and variability of bacterial colonies are strongly dependent on the species and also influenced by environmental conditions. However, the spatial organization of individual cells is unknown for most strains. How specific heterogeneous cell types at different locations in a colony contribute to the overall structure and how they may influence the overall function of a colony is largely unknown. The study aims to investigate the local diversification of bacterial colony structures by introducing a local biopsy technique.

The biopsied cells were analyzed by microbial flow cytometry and cytometric fingerprinting, which diversified the biopsied samples into many heterogeneous cell states. This two-stage resolution insight into colony structure was performed on five bacterial strains: Bacillus subtilis, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Kocuria rhizophila, Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, and Pseudomonas citronellolis. The effects of biopsy tool size (27G needle and 10 {micro}L, 200 {micro}L, 1000 {micro}L pipette tips) and sampling location on the precision of the technique were tested by using both gates setting along Gaussian distributions of subpopulations and a grid gating tool as well as the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method.

The biopsy technique uncovered significant heterogeneity among the cells within bacterial colonies, identifying differences in cell cycle stages, the proportion of living and dead cells, and the abundance of spore types. Cells from different biopsy sites displayed distinct physiological states, revealing that colony structure is far more complex than previously understood. The techniques precision depends on the biopsy tool size, dye equilibration, and cell handling, underscoring the importance of method calibration. The biopsy method, combined with cytometric fingerprinting, provided insights within only 15 to 45 minutes and is universally applicable.

The study provides a high-resolution biopsy technique that explores the spatial distribution of cell types and their heterogeneous physiological cell states, allowing conclusions to be drawn from biopsy composition at different locations to overarching functions of the entire bacterial colony. This method also facilitates downstream analysis through further cell sorting, offering a powerful approach for future functional investigations.",NA,biorxiv

As a result, computational methods, including diffusion models, designed for molecule generation tasks have gained significant traction. Despite their potential, they have faced criticism for producing physically implausible outputs. We alleviate this problem by conditionally training a diffusion model capable of generating molecules of varying and controllable levels of structural plausibility. This is achieved by adding distorted molecules to training datasets, and then annotating each molecule with a label representing the extent of its distortion, and hence its quality. By training the model to distinguish between favourable and unfavourable molecular conformations alongside the standard molecule generation training process, we can selectively sample molecules from the high-quality region of learned space, resulting in improvements in the validity of generated molecules. In addition to the standard two datasets used by molecule generation methods (QM9 and GEOM), we also test our method on a druglike dataset derived from ZINC. We use our conditional method with EDM, the first E(3) equivariant diffusion model for molecule generation, as well as two further models--a more recent diffusion model and a flow matching model--which were built off EDM. We demonstrate improvements in validity as assessed by RD-Kit parsability and the PoseBusters test suite; more broadly, though, our findings highlight the effectiveness of conditioning methods on low-quality data to improve the sampling of high-quality data.",NA,biorxiv

This hypermethylation impairs the binding of core transcription factors that govern microglial responses, resulting in reduced expression of inflammatory and glycolytic metabolism programs. Prolonged exposure of human primary microglia to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) inhibits TET-mediated demethylation at lineage-specific enhancers, evidenced by elevated 5mC/5hmC ratios near binding motifs. D-2HG-treated microglia showed reduced proinflammatory capacity and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, consistent with the remodeled enhancer landscape. Conversely, depletion of D-2HG following treatment of a glioma patient with an IDH-mutant inhibitor unleashed microglial reactivity, as assessed by snRNA-seq.

We established soil microcosms with increasingly complex protist communities, including a control without protists, a medium diversity treatment with three small bacterivorous protists, and a high diversity treatment with seven protists of diverse trophic styles and sizes. Over 21 days, we monitored changes in the prokaryotic community using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and assessed the effects on nitrifiers and denitrifiers by qPCR of nitrogen-cycling genes. Protist diversity explained 23 % of the observed prokaryotic community differentiation over time, with the high-diversity treatment causing the greatest divergence from the control. The most abundant prokaryotes were preferentially predated in all protist treatments. Unexpectedly, the absolute abundance of the nirK gene, which is widely distributed among bacterial taxa and thus associated with high functional redundancy, decreased. The differential response of genes with lower distribution and redundancy, such as the bacterial and archaeal amoA and the Nitrospira-associated nxrB genes, to protist diversity indicated selective predation on archaea. High protist diversity systematically enhanced these effects compared to the medium diversity treatment. Overall, protist diversity was positively associated with prokaryotic diversity, which is crucial for maintaining ecosystem stability.

Our understanding of the metabolic processes that fuel kidney functions is limited by the kidneys structural and functional heterogeneity. As the kidney contains many different cell types, we hypothesize that intra-renal mitochondrial heterogeneity contributes to cell-specific metabolism. To interrogate this, we utilized a recently developed mitochondrial tagging technique to isolate kidney cell-type specific mitochondria. Here, we investigate mitochondrial functional capacities and the metabolomes of the early and late proximal tubule (PT) and the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The conditional MITO-Tag allele was combined with Slc34a1-CreERT2, Ggt1-Cre, or Pvalb-Cre alleles to generate mouse models capable of cell-specific isolation of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged mitochondria from the early PT, late PT, or the DCT, respectively. Functional assays measuring mitochondrial respiratory and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) capacities and metabolomics were performed on anti-HA immunoprecipitated mitochondria from kidneys of ad libitum fed and 24-hour fasted male mice. The renal MITO-Tag models targeting the early PT, late PT, and DCT revealed differential mitochondrial respiratory and FAO capacities which dynamically changed during fasting conditions. Changes with mitochondrial metabolomes induced by fasting suggest that the late PT significantly increases FAO during fasting. The renal MITO-Tag model captured differential mitochondrial metabolism and functional capacities across the early PT, late PT, and DCT at baseline and in response to fasting.

Translational StatementWhile the renal cortex is often considered a single metabolic compartment, we discovered significant diversity of mitochondrial metabolomes and functional capacities across the proximal tubule and the distal convoluted tubule.

While recent advances in protein generative models, which learn probability distributions over amino acids conditioned on structural or evolutionary sequence contexts, have shown impressive performance in predicting various protein properties without task-specific training, their strong unsupervised prediction ability does not extend to all protein functions. In particular, their potential to improve protein stability prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we present SPURS, a novel deep learning framework that adapts and integrates two general-purpose protein generative models-a protein language model (ESM) and an inverse folding model (ProteinMPNN)-into an effective stability predictor. SPURS employs a lightweight neural network module to rewire per-residue structure representations learned by ProteinMPNN into the attention layers of ESM, thereby informing and enhancing ESMs sequence representation learning. This rewiring strategy enables SPURS to harness evolutionary patterns from both sequence and structure data, where the sequence like-lihood distribution learned by ESM is conditioned on structure priors encoded by ProteinMPNN to predict mutation effects. We steer this integrated framework to a stability prediction model through supervised training on a recently released mega-scale thermostability dataset. Evaluations across 12 benchmark datasets showed that SPURS delivers accurate, rapid, scalable, and generalizable stability predictions, consistently outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SPURS demonstrates remarkable versatility in protein stability and function analyses: when combined with a protein language model, it accurately identifies protein functional sites in an unsupervised manner. Additionally, it enhances current low-N protein fitness prediction models by serving as a stability prior model to improve accuracy.

However, due to the complex nature of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry acquisition, data quality checks are often not done comprehensively and only at the post-processing step.

This isolation, combined with substantial Denisovan ancestry, contributes to the unique genetic makeup of the Papua New Guinean population. Previous research suggested the possibility of admixture with an early diverged modern human population, but the extent of this contribution remains debated. This study re-examines the demographic history of the Papua New Guinean population using newly published samples and advanced analytical methods. Our findings demonstrate that the observed shifts in relative cross coalescent rate curves are unlikely to result from technical artefacts or contributions from an earlier out of Africa population. Instead, they are likely due to a significant bottleneck and slower population growth rate within the Papua New Guinean population. Our analysis positions the Papua New Guinean population as a sister group to other Asian populations, challenging the notion of Papua New Guinean as an outgroup to both European and Asian populations. This study provides new insights into the complex demographic history of the Papua New Guinean population and underscores the importance of considering population-specific demographic events in interpreting relative cross coalescent rate curves.",NA,biorxiv

While transcriptomic profiling is widely performed, proteomic analyses of early vertebrate embryos remain limited due to technical challenges in embryonic sample preparation. Here, we propose an ""in-cell proteomics"" approach, which bypasses cell lysis and yolk depletion, processes individual embryos directly in functionalized filter devices, and generates liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-friendly samples in an extremely robust and streamlined manner. Combined with a single-shot data-independent acquisition (DIA) MS workflow, this approach enabled us to consistently quantify [~]6,200 proteins from a single Xenopus tropicalis embryo, representing the deepest proteomic coverage of early X. tropicalis development reported to date. Investigation of the temporal proteomes across five cleavage stages (1- to 16-cell) revealed a drastic proteomic shift between 2- and 4-cell stages, followed by more gradual transitions thereafter. Spatial analysis of dissected 8-cell blastomeres uncovered pronounced molecular asymmetry along the animal-vegetal axis, while dorsal-ventral differences were minimal. This study establishes a novel in-cell proteomics technology in conjunction with DIA-MS as a robust platform for high-resolution, low-input developmental proteomics analysis, and provides a comprehensive spatiotemporal protein atlas for early X. tropicalis embryos.",NA,biorxiv

Moreover, infections with S. agalactiae are posing significant health implications and, also, recent studies are highlighting a potential zoonotic risk. Despite the comparatively frequent isolation of S. agalactiae from elephants, only a few reports document infections in wild and zoo populations. We performed a comparative genomic analysis of 24 elephant isolates from three different zoos in Germany, to achieve a comprehensive characterization. Elephant isolates showed pronounced phylogenetic divergence from isolates of other host species, while also forming clusters based on their zoo of origin and their genotypes (MLST profiles).

Across all plant groups, the phytohormone auxin controls meristem maintenance, represses the emergence of new meristems (apical dominance) and mediates cellular reprogramming when new meristems regenerate following damage to existing meristems. The liverwort Marchantia produces clonal propagules (gemmae) featuring two meristematic apical notches, presenting a tractable experimental system to study meristem biology. I used laser ablation microscopy to precisely disrupt these apical notches, finding that the first apical cell layer is indispensable for meristem maintenance. Within this layer, a contiguous quorum of cells is required for meristem activity, depending on the status of surrounding meristems. Apical notches reorientate in response to damage, demonstrating that the apical cells act as a communicating population. Unlike the current model, where a single Apical Cell at the apex (centre) of the notch produces and is surrounded by subapical cells, this updated model shows that feedback from the apical cell population is necessary to maintain meristem activity and to define the apex of the notch. These experiments show communication between notches and regenerating meristems, with heterogeneity across the gemma tissue for carrying these signals. The apical dominance signal represses cell division and requires both sources and sinks, features of auxin-mediated communication. I present a model of Marchantia meristem organization, involving intra-, inter- and extra-meristem communication. This provides a framework for further study of meristem communication, formation and maintenance in Marchantia and improving knowledge of plant meristems more widely.

Significance StatementMeristems are the growth centres of plants. Understanding how meristems function, how existing meristems stop new meristems emerging (apical dominance) and how cellular reprogramming regenerates meristems is central to understanding plant development. The liverwort Marchantia is an increasingly important model plant, as it offers a streamlined system whose evolutionary position makes its biology relevant to all plant groups. Marchantia apical notch meristems display regenerative and dominance behaviour typical of plant meristems. I used laser ablation to make precise disruptions to the apical notch, producing an improved model of Marchantia meristem organization involving intra- and inter-meristem communication characteristic of the hormone auxin. This will inform future Marchantia research and provide a simplified experimental framework for the study of complex meristematic processes.",NA,biorxiv

This phenomenon reduces the efficacy of drug therapies and thus compromises patient health. In spatially heterogeneous drug environments, recent evidence shows that migration can either promote or decelerate the evolution of antibiotic resistance, thereby affecting the rate of resistant phenotype emergence. However, another important quantitative aspect of resistance evolution--bacterial phenotypic diversity--has often been overlooked and remains challenging to investigate in spatially extended systems, both experimentally and clinically. In order to study how diversity is reshaped by migration across space, here we designed a minimal 2-well experimental system with spatial drug asymmetry. One well contained a bacteriostatic drug (Linezolid) at the minimum inhibitory concentration, while the other well served as a sanctuary with just media. We found that the relationship between diversity and migration follows the ""Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis"" (IDH), with migration as the disturbance to each well. By varying the selective drug concentrations, we observed that the diversity-migration relationship changes, and IDH can disappear. This behavior was explained by an asymmetry parameter derived from a two-phenotype growth-migration dynamic model.

To further validate how different spatial drug asymmetries modulate the diversity-migration relationship through this asymmetry parameter, we applied another bactericidal drug, Ampicillin, and observed similar results. In a more complex scenario involving both Linezolid and Ampicillin, four distinct phenotypes, including cross-resistant variants, emerged. Our asymmetry parameter successfully explained the diversity-migration relationship, with unique diversity dynamics such as multiple peaks appearing from the model. The minimal generalist-specialist framework predicted these unique behaviors through global fitness advantages. Our findings provide experimental support and theoretical explanations for the emergence of phenotypic diversity in clinical settings, such as gut-lung translocation. These insights may pave the way for improved clinical strategies to manage antibiotic resistance evolution.",NA,biorxiv

Subsequently the centriole undergoes conversion to a centrosome requiring its radial expansion and elongation, mediated by a network requiring interactions between Cep135, Ana1/Cep295, and Asterless/Cep152. Here we show that mutant alleles encoding overlapping N- and C-terminal parts of Ana1 are capable of intragenic complementation to rescue radial expansion. This permits recruitment of Asl and thereby centriole duplication and mechanosensory cilia formation to restore the coordination defects of these mutants. This genetic combination also rescues centriole duplication in the male germ line but does not rescue the elongation of the triplet microtubule-containing centrioles of primary spermatocytes and consequently these males are coordinated but sterile. Such centriole elongation is rescued by the continuous, full-length Ana1 sequence. We define a region that when deleted within otherwise intact Ana1 does not permit primary spermatocyte centrioles to elongate but still allows recruitment of Asl. Our findings point to differing demands upon the physical organization of Ana1 for the distinct processes of radial expansion and elongation of centrioles.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes a photosensitizer and light to generate cytotoxic reactive species that are efficacious against bacteria. We sought to determine whether PDT could effectively eliminate bacteria isolated from the peritoneal cavities of pediatric patients with perforated appendicitis.

HypothesisIn monoculture planktonic samples, PDT achieves a minimum of 99.9% bacterial cell kill (3 log10 growth reduction per mL).

MethodsAfter IRB approval, bacterial subcultures from 30 pediatric surgical patients with PA were developed as planktonic monocultures. Samples were derived from standard clinical collection of peritoneal fluid in patients undergoing surgery for PA. Cultures were incubated with the photosensitizer methylene blue (MB) and exposed to a 665 nm laser to perform PDT. Control conditions were MB alone, laser alone, or no MB and no laser. Log reductions in bacterial growth between groups were compared using two-way ANOVA.

ResultsBacteria were isolated from 28 (93.3%) specimens, and 26 (86.7%) were polymicrobial. The most prevalent organisms included Escherichia coli (76.7%), the Streptococcus anginosus group (56.7%), Bacteroides fragilis (46.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.7%), with antibiotic resistance common among E. coli isolates.

For E. coli, MB-PDT caused a 5.86 {+/-} 0.39 log10 reduction compared to the no-treatment control (p<0.001). For S. anginosus and P. aeruginosa, MB-PDT resulted in reductions of 5.91 {+/-} 0.88 log10 and 2.23 {+/-} 0.64 log10, respectively (all p<0.001). PDT showed comparable efficacy in isolates with multiple antibiotic resistance relative to those that were antibiotic pan-susceptible for E. coli (p=0.760), S. anginosus group (p>0.999), and P. aeruginosa (p=0.991).

ConclusionsPDT application to bacterial isolates from patients with perforated appendicitis achieved >99.9% bacterial kill in all isolated strains other than P. aeruginosa, regardless of antibiotic susceptibility, suggesting that PDT may be a viable adjunct to in vivo antimicrobial therapy.",NA,biorxiv

Overlooking this variation not only weakens our analyses but also risks selecting inaccurate models, generating false precision in parameter estimates, and creating artificial patterns. Furthermore, the complexity of uncertainty extends beyond traditional ""measurement error,"" encompassing various sources of intraspecific variance. To address this, we propose the term ""tip fog"" to describe the variance between the true species mean and what is recorded, without implying a specific mechanism. We show why accounting for tip fog remains critical by showing its impact on continuous comparative models and discrete comparative and diversification models. We rederive methods to estimate this variance and use simulations to assess its feasibility and importance in a comparative context. Our findings reveal that ignoring tip fog substantially affects the accuracy of rate estimates, with higher tip fog levels showing greater biases from the true rates, as well as affecting which models are chosen. The findings underscore the importance of model selection and the potential consequences of neglecting tip fog, providing insights for improving the accuracy of comparative methods in evolutionary biology.",NA,biorxiv

MethodsWe tested Type I (bind kinase active conformation) and Type II (bind kinase inactive conformation) JAKinibs in vitro using mesenchymal stromal cells and endothelial cells. We translated our findings in vivo studying NK cells from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with Type I JAKinibs or methotrexate.

ResultsType I JAKinibs (ruxolitinib and baricitinib) increased phosphoJAK1 (pJAK1) and pJAK2 of IFN{gamma}-stimulated MSCs and HUVECs in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with effect peaking after 24 hours. As expected, pSTAT1 was completely suppressed by JAKinibs. We found a marked and rapid increase of pSTATs upon discontinuation of Type I JAKinibs, that occurred to a lesser extent after Type II JAKinib withdrawal. Type I JAKinib withdrawal increased interferon and urokinase expression when compared to Type II JAKinib withdrawal. We found NK cells from RA patients taking Type I JAKinibs had a pro-inflammatory profile after JAKinib withdrawal compared to patients on methotrexate.

ConclusionsType I JAKinibs paradoxically accumulate functionally defective pJAK. Upon withdrawal, the primed pJAKs are de-repressed and initiate a pSTAT signaling cascade, resulting in high interferon and urokinase. Type II JAKinibs do not cause pJAK accumulation, pSTAT cascade, and subsequent pro-inflammatory transcripts. The resultant cytokines and proteins produced from this cascade might be associated with adverse cardiac outcomes. Thus, JAKinib withdrawal is a possible mechanism contributing to the major adverse cardiac events described with JAKinib therapy.",NA,biorxiv

This study presents six high-quality amoeba genomes from known and potential giant virus hosts belonging to two distinct eukaryotic clades: Amoebozoa and Discoba. We employ their genomic data to investigate the predictability of giant virus host range. Using a combination of long and short-read sequencing, we obtained highly contiguous and complete genomes of Acanthamoeba castellanii, Acanthamoeba griffini, Acanthamoeba terricola, Naegleria clarki, Vermamoeba vermiformis, and Willaertia magna, contributing to the collection of sequences for the eukaryotic tree of life. We found that the six amoebae have distinct codon usage patterns and that, contrary to other virus groups, giant viruses often have different and even opposite codon usage with their known hosts. Conversely, giant viruses with matching codon usage are frequently not known to infect or replicate in these hosts. Interestingly, analyses of integrated viral sequences in the amoeba host genomes reveal potential novel virus-host associations. Matching of codon usage preferences is often used to predict virus-host pairs. However, with the broad-scale analyses performed in this study, we demonstrate that codon usage alone appears to be a poor predictor of giant virus host range. We discuss the potential strategies that giant viruses employ to ensure high viral fitness in non-matching hosts. Moreover, this study emphasises the need for more high-quality protist genomes.

In epilepsy, BDNF exhibits a dual role, exerting both antiepileptic and pro-epileptic effects. The cleavage of its main receptor, full-length tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB-FL), was suggested to occur in status epilepticus (SE) in vitro. Moreover, under excitotoxic conditions, TrkB-FL was found to be cleaved, resulting in the formation of a new intracellular fragment, TrkB-ICD. Thus, we hypothesized that TrkB-FL cleavage and TrkB-ICD formation could represent an uncovered mechanism in epilepsy.

We used a rat model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) induced by kainic acid (KA) to investigate TrkB-FL cleavage and TrkB-ICD formation during SE and established epilepsy (EE). Animals treated with 10 mg/kg of KA exhibited TrkB-FL cleavage during SE, with hippocampal levels of TrkB-FL and TrkB-ICD correlating with seizure severity. Notably, TrkB-FL cleavage and TrkB-ICD formation were also detected in animals with EE, which exhibited spontaneous recurrent convulsive seizures, neuronal death, mossy fiber sprouting, and long-term memory impairment. Importantly, hippocampal samples from patients with refractory epilepsy also showed TrkB-FL cleavage with increased TrkB-ICD levels. Additionally, overexpression of TrkB-ICD in the hippocampus of healthy rodents resulted in long-term memory impairment.

Our findings suggest that TrkB-FL cleavage and the subsequent TrkB-ICD production occur throughout epileptogenesis, with the extent of cleavage correlating positively with seizure occurrence. Moreover, we found that TrkB-ICD impairs memory. This work uncovers a novel mechanism in epileptogenesis that could serve as a potential therapeutic target in mTLE, with implications for preserving cognitive function.",10.1016/j.phrs.2025.107707,biorxiv

Here, we profiled single-cell transcriptional signatures in placental layers comprising the maternal-fetal interface and deep placenta, then searched for genes associated with preeclampsia. To investigate the underlying principle of the failure of immune tolerance, we started by clarifying the systemic framework, comprising models of immune interaction frequency (IIF) and specific triggers (i.e., influencers) of tolerance (IT). We generated single-cell transcriptional profiles of normal term (Norms) and preeclampsia preterm (PePT) parturitions. Fetal and maternal cells are admixed across the placenta, for both Norms and PePTs, rejecting the IIF model of immune failure during pregnancy posed by excessive interactions between fetomaternal cells. Whereas placental layers are well mixed with maternal cells, we identified a conserved gradual immune transition of fetal T-cells in both PePT and Norm, disproving the IIF model. To search for influencers of PePT in the IT model, we established and validated a classification model for PePT and Norm immune cells, including T-cells, and then prioritized major contributors to the classifier model, which are highly enriched in ligands and receptors (p = 5.98e-5). Among the prioritized ligand receptors, SPP1 and CD44 are suggested as influencers of inflammation signatures and were experimentally validated by the exclusive colocalization of SPP1- and CD44-expressing cells in the PePT placentas. Different interleukin-4 and interferon-{psi} levels in the serum and urine of PePTs further support the contribution of SPP1 to associated pathways, including allograft rejection.

Here, we show that PHF6 is a transcriptional repressor that suppresses a stemness gene network, and that PHF6 missense mutations, classified by current clinical algorithms as variants of unknown significance, produce unstable or non-functional protein. We present multiple lines of evidence converging on a critical mechanistic connection between PHF6 and PHIP.

Far less studied with realistic body models is how the brain and motor systems work together to perform hierarchical sensorimotor control. Here we present NeuroMechFly v2, a framework that expands Drosophila neuromechanical modeling by enabling visual and olfactory sensing, ascending motor feedback, and complex terrains that can be navigated using leg adhesion. We illustrate its capabilities by first constructing biologically inspired locomotor controllers that use ascending motor feedback to perform path integration and head stabilization. Then, we add visual and olfactory sensing to this controller and train it using reinforcement learning to perform a multimodal navigation task in closed loop. Finally, we illustrate more biorealistic modeling in two ways: our model navigates a complex odor plume using a Drosophila odor taxis strategy, and it uses a connectome-constrained visual system network to follow another simulated fly. With this framework, NeuroMechFly can be used to accelerate the discovery of explanatory models of the nervous system and to develop machine learning-based controllers for autonomous artificial agents and robots.",NA,biorxiv

To do so, we develop a computational model for structural plasticity in the olfactory bulb and show that it is the maturation process of adult-born neurons that enables the bulb to learn quickly and forget slowly. Particularly important are the transient enhancement of the plasticity, excitability, and susceptibility to apoptosis that characterizes young neurons.

Here we show that varying the electrical potential across the sensory hair-cell epithelium continuously modulates the gating force, by up to {+/-}100%. Our observations also revealed an abrupt transition between states of weak and strong gating force at a threshold potential, so that strong gating forces associated to high mechanosensitivity are observed only when the calcium influx through the channels is large enough, but not too large. Gating-force changes, remarkably enough, were explained by the modularity of the gating swing, ranging from values comparable to the channel pore size to nearly tenfold larger.

One prominent difference is that orientation selectivity is found in mouse superficial superior colliculus (SC), but is not commonly observed in primate SC. Nevertheless, there may be conservation of computational principles if orientation selectivity in mouse superficial SC displays similar properties to primate primary visual cortex (V1), such as invariance to differences in other stimulus dimensions. However, a recent calcium (Ca2+) imaging study revealed a population map for stimulus orientation in mouse superficial SC that changed with stimulus properties such as size, shape and spatial frequency, in apparent contradistinction to computational principles for orientation selectivity in primates. To reconcile mouse and primate mechanisms for orientation selectivity, we constructed computational models of mouse superficial SC populations with fixed, stimulus-invariant receptive fields (RFs) classically used to describe neural RFs in monkey lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and V1. At preferred spatial frequencies, model RFs exhibited stronger responses where the aperture and gratings were differently oriented, while at non-preferred frequencies, orientation selectivity reversed, matching the imaging data. We provide an intuitive explanation by visualizing stimulus-RF interactions in the spatial frequency domain. Intrinsically oriented RFs were unnecessary to explain much of the imaging data, but modeling of single units suggests a possible subpopulation of intrinsically orientation-selective cells. In summary, our population modeling approach provides a parsimonious explanation for stimulus-dependent orientation selectivity consistent with well-established results from sensory neurophysiology. More broadly, we provide a population modeling framework for establishing shared computations across species.",NA,biorxiv

In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), alternative alleles at the gene vgll3 have been found to associate with a large proportion of the variation in maturation age, yet the molecular and physiological mechanisms of this association are still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which genetic variation in this major age-at-maturity gene translated into phenotypic variation. We established a time series of gonadal vgll3 mRNA expression in male and female Atlantic salmon in a common garden setting, starting at the prepubertal stage and spanning multiple spawning seasons. We found that vgll3 mRNA expression is reduced in early-maturing males and females. However, for the second spawning season, vgll3 expression increased with gonadal development in males, but eventually decreased in females. Expression of vgll3 had context-dependent correlations with expression of amh and lhr. We also found signs of reduced testicular vgll3 expression in a low-fat feed treatment. By significantly widening the scope of our knowledge on temporal vgll3 expression dynamics, our results exemplify that major-effect genes may use different pathways in sexes but achieve similar outcomes.",NA,biorxiv

Unexpectedly, the effective glycan-glycan interactions decay logarithmically as the separation between them increases. Strikingly, this finding coincides exactly with the predicted interaction, which is entropic in origin, between two star polymers, consisting of long flexible polymers grafted onto colloidal particles. The weak repulsive interaction, which extends beyond the size of a glycan, is sensitive to the relative orientation of the glycans. The effective long-range repulsive interaction vanishes if the charges on water are turned off, thus establishing that electrostatic interactions, arising in part due to the persistent hydrogen bonds between water and the glycans, are responsible for the inter-glycan repulsion.",10.1021/jacs.5c04126,biorxiv

The metabolic constraints created by the tumor microenvironment can lead to vulnerabilities in cancers. Identifying the metabolic constraints of the tumor microenvironment and the vulnerabilities that arise in cancers can provide new insight into tumor biology and identify promising antineoplastic targets. To identify how the microenvironment constrains the metabolism of pancreatic tumors, we challenged pancreatic cancer cells with microenvironmental nutrient levels and analyzed changes in cell metabolism. We found that arginine limitation in pancreatic tumors perturbs saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis by suppressing the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1. Synthesis of these fatty acids is critical for maintaining a balance of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes. As a consequence of microenvironmental constraints on fatty acid synthesis, pancreatic cancer cells and tumors are unable to maintain lipid homeostasis when exposed to polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to cell death by ferroptosis. In sum, arginine restriction in the tumor microenvironment constrains lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancers, which renders these tumors vulnerable to polyunsaturated-enriched fat sources.",NA,biorxiv

In the current study, we used pupil dilation as a time-resolved readout of subcortical neuromodulation during patch-leaving. We hypothesised that leave decisions will be preceded by a transient pupil dilation. Participants harvested from exponentially depleting patches (blueberry bushes) with three initial reward values, in two environments, which differed in the variability of initial reward values. Behavioural results show that, as predicted by the mathematically optimal solution, participants adjusted their decisions based on the instantaneous reward rate, but also displayed a bias to overharvest (stay longer in compared to the optimum), which was more pronounced in the high variability environment. Pupil size was overall larger in the high variability environment, associated with increased uncertainty.

In this study, isolated Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440 was cultured in lab-scale reactors to mimic the WWTP environment. The degradation of this isolated strain towards different groups of CECs were studied over a 24-hour period using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics was also performed at different sampling points to establish a linkage between the enzyme expression profile of this strain and its degradation of CECs via bioinformatics analysis. The results of this study demonstrated that Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is capable of degrading atrazine, acetamiprid, carbendazim, diclofenac acid, erythromycin, and sulfamethazine at lab scale.

However, the generation of high-quality spectral libraries for DIA data analysis remains a challenge, particularly because most such libraries are generated directly from data-dependent acquisition (DDA) data or are from in silico prediction using models trained on DDA data. In this study, we developed Carafe, a tool that generates high-quality experiment-specific in silico spectral libraries by training deep learning models directly on DIA data. We demonstrate the performance of Carafe on a wide range of DIA datasets, where we observe improved fragment ion intensity prediction and peptide detection relative to existing pretrained DDA models.",NA,biorxiv

Many studies have explored different materials and active cues to guide neural regeneration, with some success. However, none have demonstrated a comparable or better functional recovery than the clinical standard autograft. Autografts are often insufficient for reconstruction of an injury to long nerves such as the sciatic or brachial plexus. Synthetic nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) have been investigated for these injuries to guide axonal regeneration and lead to functional recovery. We have designed a biologics-free hydrogel-based multi-channel conduit with defined microscale features to guide axonal outgrowth. To investigate extraneural vascular infiltration and its effects on functional recovery, we also designed a multi-microchannel conduit with defined regularly spaced micropores, orthogonal to the axon guidance channels. Using our custom-built Rapid Projection, Image-guided, Dynamic (RaPID) bioprinting system, we are able to fabricate each hydrogel conduit within minutes from a milliliter-volume prepolymer vat. With our state-of-the-art printing platform, we have achieved NGCs with a consistent channel wall width of 10 microns. We implanted the NGCs for 17 weeks in a murine sciatic nerve transection injury model. We assessed the functional recovery by dynamic gait analysis throughout the recovery period and by compound muscle action potential (CMAP) electrophysiology before NGC harvesting. Both the non-porous and micro-porous conduit groups led to functional nerve regeneration on par with the autograft group. Further, both conduit groups resulted in restoration of bulk motor function to pre-injury performance.

Translational Impact StatementWe have developed a synthetic therapeutic that can be implanted to aid nerve regeneration after a debilitating injury that performs similarly to the current clinical standard treatment. One major hurdle to clinically translating an implantable therapeutic is needing to include biologics such as cells or active biomolecules, which increases the regulatory burden. With this in mind, we systematically developed a biologics-free synthetic hydrogel nerve guidance conduit, composed of polymer backbones that have been used in many FDA-approved applications, capable of restoring motor function.",NA,biorxiv

The bat wing is characterized by an extreme elongation of the second to fifth digits and a wing membrane called chiropatagium connecting them. Here we investigated the developmental and cellular origin of this structure by comparing bat and mouse limbs using omics tools and single-cell analyses. Despite the substantial morphological differences between the species, we observed an overall conservation of cell populations and gene expression patterns including interdigital apoptosis. Single-cell analyses of micro-dissected embryonic chiropatagium identified a specific fibroblast population, independent of apoptosis-associated interdigital cells, as the origin of this tissue. These distal cells express a conserved gene program including the transcription factors MEIS2 and TBX3, which are commonly known to specify and pattern the early proximal limb. Transgenic ectopic expression of MEIS2 and TBX3 in mouse distal limb cells resulted in the activation of genes expressed during wing development and phenotypic changes related to wing morphology, such as the fusion of digits. Our results elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms of bat wing development and illustrate how drastic morphological changes can be achieved through repurposing of existing developmental programs during evolution.",NA,biorxiv

Cells must therefore translate growth into a proportional signal that can be used to determine when there has been sufficient growth for cell cycle progression. In budding yeast, the protein kinase Gin4 is required for normal control of cell growth and undergoes gradual hyperphosphorylation and activation that are dependent upon growth and proportional to the extent of growth, which suggests that Gin4 could function in mechanisms that measure cell growth. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive hyperphosphorylation of Gin4 are poorly understood. Here, we used biochemical reconstitution and genetic analysis to test hypotheses for the mechanisms that drive phosphorylation of Gin4. We ruled out a previous model in which phosphatidylserine delivered to sites of plasma membrane growth binds Gin4 to initiate autophosphorylation. Instead, we show that Elm1, a homolog of the mammalian Lkb1 tumor suppressor kinase, is sufficient to promote hyperphosphorylation of Gin4 in vitro, likely via initiation of Gin4 autophosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that casein kinase I is required for growth-dependent hyperphosphorylation of Gin4 and also for normal regulation of Elm1. Together, these discoveries lead to new insight into mechanisms that link cell cycle progression to cell growth.",NA,biorxiv

However, many SRT platforms lack single-cell resolution, necessitating cell-type deconvolution methods to estimate cell-type proportions in SRT spots. Despite advancements in existing tools, these methods have not addressed biases occurring at three scales: individual spots, entire tissue samples, and discrepancies between SRT and reference scRNA-seq datasets. These biases result in overbalanced cell-type proportions for each spot, mismatched cell-type fractions at the sample level, and data distribution shifts across platforms. To mitigate these biases, we introduce HarmoDecon, a novel semi-supervised deep learning model for spatial cell-type deconvolution. HarmoDecon leverages pseudo-spots derived from scRNA-seq data and employs Gaussian Mixture Graph Convolutional Networks to address the aforementioned issues. Through extensive simulations on multi-cell spots from STARmap and osmFISH, HarmoDecon outperformed 11 state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, when applied to legacy SRT platforms and 10x Visium datasets, HarmoDecon achieved the highest accuracy in spatial domain clustering and maintained strong correlations between cancer marker genes and cancer cells in human breast cancer samples. These results highlight the utility of HarmoDecon in advancing spatial transcriptomics analysis.",NA,biorxiv

Despite their therapeutic importance, key aspects of AAV natural biology remain obscure, complicating efforts to explain rare AAV-associated diseases and optimize gene therapy vectors. By analyzing sequence data from virus isolates and endogenous viral elements (EVEs), I reveal a striking evolutionary pattern: while AAV sub-lineages, defined by the replication-associated (rep) gene, have broadly co-diverged with host groups over millions of years, capsid (cap) diversity has been shaped by extensive recombination. In particular, one capsid lineage, Mammalian-wide (M-wide), has spread horizontally across diverse rep lineages and host taxa through multiple recombination events. Furthermore, several AAVs with M-wide capsids - including AAV-4, AAV-12, and bovine AAV (BAAV) - originate from historical adenovirus (Ad) stocks, raising the possibility that laboratory conditions contributed to capsid transfer. Distinguishing natural from laboratory-driven recombination is essential for understanding AAV ecology and its implications for gene therapy. A systematic sequencing effort in human and primate populations is needed to assess the extent of recombinant capsid acquisition, determine the impact of laboratory-driven recombination on circulating AAV diversity, and track ongoing recombination events that could affect vector safety and efficacy.",NA,biorxiv

Understanding the cellular processes that occur in the later stages of life is essential to address age-related diseases. Although aging is a global process that affects the entire body, the brain is one of the most sensitive organs and is affected by numerous degenerative diseases. In this study, we investigate cell types and genes that are particularly sensitive to the aging process. To this end, we performed a time-course single-cell RNAseq experiment series in the brain of the killifish, the vertebrate model with the shortest lifespan, which makes it an excellent model for aging studies. Our analysis reveals that non-glial progenitor cells are among those populations that change the most between young and old animals. Furthermore, we identify specialized stromal clusters that seem to support a primitive hematopoietic program in the brain, which is active only during the embryonic stages in other vertebrate species. Our results show that the expression of embryonic genes in the adult brain appears to be a general feature in killifish, and that several cell populations in the adult killifish brain show a higher level of similarity to the zebrafish embryonic populations than to adult ones. Our study suggests that adult killifish maintain a neotenic gene expression status in the brain that may help in sustaining their characteristic high proliferation and metabolic rates, as well as combat the detrimental effects of this high metabolism on cells, especially at advanced ages.",NA,biorxiv

Such studies require modeling of low-occupancy species, for instance time-evolving intermediates and bound ligands. In protein crystallography, difference maps that compare paired perturbed and reference datasets are a powerful way to identify and aid modeling of low-occupancy species. Current methods to generate difference maps, however, rely on manually tuned parameters and, in cases of weak signal due to low occupancy, can fail to extract clear, chemically interpretable signals.

We address these issues, first by showing negentropy is an effective metric to assess difference map quality and can therefore be used to automatically determine parameters needed during difference map calculation. Leveraging this, we apply total variation denoising, an image restoration technique that requires a choice of regularization parameter, to crystallographic difference maps. We show that total variation denoising improves map signal-to-noise and enables us to estimate the latent phase contribution of low-occupancy states. This technology opens new possibilities for time-resolved and ligand-screening crystallography in particular, allowing the detection of states that previously could not be resolved due to their inherently low occupancy.",NA,biorxiv

In nucleic acid sequencing, nucleotide sequences stored in the FASTQ format are widely shared, but FASTQ files are generated from platform-specific raw data outputs, which vary depending on the sequencing platform used. The raw data produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing devices contain valuable biological information and are also useful to improve data processing methods, which includes basecaller optimisation and modification detection. Increasing attention goes to exploring these raw signals to develop algorithms that could improve ONT device portability and enhance target enrichment efficiency through adaptive sampling. Despite these benefits, the storage and sharing of raw nanopore data remain limited due to technical constraints and the lack of appropriate, standardised and centralised infrastructure. To address this challenge, we developed SquiDBase (https://squidbase.org), a dedicated repository to collect raw microbial nanopore sequencing data. To maximise the utility of SquiDBase from its inception, we built SquiDPipe, a Nextflow pipeline for the automated removal of human or unwanted reads from raw nanopore data. Additionally, we sequenced 24 clinically relevant viruses and incorporated them into SquiDBase, significantly expanding the diversity of publicly available reference datasets.

Although it has been found that cell alignment exhibits a density-dependent collective behavior, the collective mechanisms within this process remain elusive. In this study, we present a model of collective cell alignment induced by uniaxial mechanical stretch and explore the mechanisms driving this phenomenon. We demonstrate that alignment occurs in a density-dependent manner, with dense cell populations aligning while sparse populations do not. Contrary to previous findings, our results show that this alignment is initiated by substrate deformation upon stretch, which biases cell orientations towards the stretched direction. This deformation-induced alignment occurs passively and simultaneously, allowing us to isolate and identify the factors contributing to the collective behavior. Importantly, we find that once stretched, cells in low-density cultures lose alignment over time, while cells in high-density cultures are able to maintain the alignment level, exhibiting positional adaptation. Furthermore, we observe a self-organization process in high-density cultures, where cells actively reorient towards the stretched direction through cell-cell interactions, enhancing the overall alignment level over time. The emergence of the alignment response has implications for how cell alignment is achieved and sheds light on the cooperative mechanisms underlying collective cell behaviors. Additionally, our findings introduce a novel methodology for aligning cells that could be used for biomedical and tissue engineering applications.",NA,biorxiv

The ice-binding helices feature an ordered array of TXXXAXXXAXX motifs, spaced to match the pyramidal {201} and secondary prism plane {110} ice lattice facets, and engineered with a 98.2{degrees} turn angle per residue to orient threonines uniformly towards the ice surface. iTHR proteins show high solubility, thermostability, and produce varied ice crystal morphologies depending on their intended target facet. Crucially, iTHRs exhibit ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) at critical concentrations comparable to those of many native globular ice-binding proteins. Extensive site-specific mutagenesis shows that ice-binding activity in iTHR proteins is robust, remaining largely unaffected by changes in chemical composition. Variation in the repeat number reveals a non-monotonic relationship to IRI activity.

An eight-pattern solution was selected for closer examination based on its high reproducibility of the occurrence rates (r=0.86) and the spatial topography (r=0.79) between sessions. Dynamic AC patterns successfully captured interindividual variability, as indicated by significantly higher variability between than within individuals for the AC pattern occurrence rates and spatial topographies.

Furthermore, the occurrence rates of AC patterns identified in the task data, using pattern templates derived from resting-state data, correlated with specific task contrast regressors. Our results indicate that the AC function can be characterized by a set of dynamically varying coactivation patterns that are consistently observed during resting state and auditory stimulation, and that get synchronized with auditory input.

Culex pipiens is a widespread mosquito species and an important vector of zoonotic pathogens in Europe, including West Nile virus. Understanding Cx. pipiens distribution is essential to orient monitoring and mitigation strategies for vector-borne disease risk. Here, we employed an ensemble modelling framework to investigate the climatic and environmental determinants of Cx. pipiens distribution in continental Europe. We integrated high-resolution occurrence data from entomological surveillance with bioclimatic, topographic, and anthropogenic variables. Our findings identified imperviousness as the most influential predictor of Cx. pipiens distribution, with a strong association with human-modified low-elevation areas that reflects its adaptability to anthropogenic environments. The ensemble prediction approach we employed demonstrated higher predictive accuracy and transferability compared to individual models during independent block validation. These results emphasize the need to incorporate anthropogenic factors into disease vector distribution models to support evidence-based surveillance and control strategies, while also offering updated, robust, and spatially explicit predictions of the habitat suitability for Cx. pipiens in Europe. Overall, this study highlights the role of human modification of the natural environment in shaping Cx. pipiens distribution, extending previous knowledge on the role of urban areas.",NA,biorxiv

Machine learning models have demonstrated significant potential for predicting enzyme kinetic parameters in recent years. Despite this promise, these methods face challenges, including limited training data, inadequate sensitivity to subtle mutations, and poor alignment with practical enzyme engineering contexts. Here, we introduce SAKPE (Site Attention Kinetic Parameters Prediction Method for Enzyme Engineering), a novel machine-learning framework designed to predict enzyme kinetic parameters with enhanced accuracy in practical application scenarios. By incorporating protein representation, substrate representation, and protein representation with weights for important sites, SAKPE significantly outperforms existing methods in predicting enzymatic kinetic parameters, including turnover number (kcat), Michaelis constant (Km), and inhibition constant (Ki). Incorporating protein representation with weights for important sites enables SAKPE to effectively capture the impact of mutations, especially mutations of important sites and their surrounding amino acids of interest in enzyme engineering, on enzyme kinetics parameters. SAKPE offers a robust and practical tool for predicting enzyme kinetic parameters, providing a superior tool for enzyme engineering scenarios such as enzyme design, directed evolution, and industrial applications.",NA,biorxiv

However, this function can be detrimental during allergic reactions, since vagal nociceptors can contribute to immune cell infiltration, bronchial hypersensitivity, and mucus imbalance, in addition to causing pain and coughing. Despite this, the specific mechanisms by which nociceptors acquire pro-inflammatory characteristics during allergic reactions are not yet fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular profile of airway nociceptor neurons during allergic airway inflammation and identify the signals driving such reprogramming. Using retrograde tracing and lineage reporting, we identified a unique class of inflammatory vagal nociceptor neurons that exclusively innervate the airways. In the ovalbumin mouse model of airway inflammation, these neurons undergo significant reprogramming characterized by the upregulation of the NPY receptor Npy1r. A screening of cytokines and neurotrophins revealed that IL-1{beta}, IL-13 and BDNF drive part of this reprogramming. IL-13 triggered Npy1r overexpression in nociceptors via the JAK/STAT6 pathway. In parallel, sympathetic neurons and macrophages release NPY in the bronchoalveolar fluid of asthmatic mice, which limits the excitability of nociceptor neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung immune cells has revealed that a cell-specific knockout of Npy1r in nociceptor neurons in asthmatic mice leads to an increase in airway inflammation mediated by T cells. Opposite findings were observed in asthmatic mice in which nociceptor neurons were chemically ablated. In summary, allergic airway inflammation reprograms airway nociceptor neurons to acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype, while a compensatory mechanism involving NPY1R limits nociceptor neurons activity.",NA,biorxiv

However, the definition and role of the morphology of gastric slow-wave signals have remained limited. This study aimed to investigate the potential of gastric slow-wave morphology as an actionable biomarker.

MethodsData were repurposed from a study where, following ethical approval, a control cohort (n=9) and a pathological cohort of patients with chronic unexplained nausea and vomiting (CUNV; n=8) underwent intra-operative high-resolution serosal electrical mapping (96-256 electrodes, 4.0-5.2 mm spacing). Slow waves were identified using validated software, and spatiotemporally averaged waveforms were compared between cohorts. These waveforms were replicated in a computational model of gastric slow-wave propagation to explore potential functional implications.

ResultsThe slow-wave morphology of the CUNV cohort exhibited a more gradual recovery stroke compared to controls, which manifested as an increase in the normalized recovery stroke area [0.206 (95% CI: 0.169-0.247) vs. 0.134 (95% CI: 0.106-0.166); p=0.011]. Computational modeling showed that these morphological differences could drive spatial slow-wave dysrhythmias. Considering the evident functional importance of gastric slow-wave morphology, we highlighted the three typical morphological features: 1) rapid, brief upstroke, 2) downstroke, and 3) biphasic recovery stroke.

ConclusionAltogether, this study presents a case for gastric slow-wave morphology as a biomarker of gastric health and disease and lays a foundation for the standardization of future slow-wave morphology research.

Because homologous recombination occurs at a constant, low level, populations of BtE264 are always heterogeneous, but cells containing two or more copies of the region (Dup+) have an advantage, and hence predominate, during biofilm growth, while those with a single copy (Dup-) are favored during planktonic growth. Moreover, only Dup+ bacteria form  efficient biofilms within 24 hours in liquid medium. We determined that duplicate copies of a subregion containing genes encoding an archaic chaperone-usher pilus (aplFABCDE) and a two-component regulatory system (bubSR) are necessary and sufficient for generating efficient biofilms and for conferring a selective advantage during biofilm growth. BubSR functionality is required, as deletion of either bubS or bubR, or a mutation predicted to abrogate phosphorylation of BubR, abrogates biofilm formation. However, duplicate copies of the aplFABCDE genes are not required. Instead, we found that BubSR controls expression of aplFABCDE and bubSR by activating a promoter upstream of aplF during biofilm growth or when the 208.6 kb region, or just bubSR, are duplicated. Single cell analyses showed that duplication of the 208.6 kb region is sufficient to activate BubSR in 75% of bacteria during planktonic (BubSR  OFF) growth conditions. Together, our data indicate that the combination of deterministic two-component signal transduction and stochastic, duplication-mediated activation of that TCS form a bet-hedging strategy that allows BtE264 to survive when conditions shift rapidly from those favoring planktonic growth to those requiring biofilm formation, such as may be encountered in the soils of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Our data highlight the positive impact that transposable elements can have on the evolution of bacterial populations.

Author summaryTransposable elements naturally accumulate within genomes in all kingdoms of life. When present in the same orientation, a pair of homologous elements can act as substrates for DNA recombination reactions that can duplicate and delete intervening sequences - giving rise to genetically heterogenous populations. We showed here that Burkholderia thailandensis strain E264 uses this mechanism to amplify genes encoding a two-component regulatory system and an archaic chaperone usher pilus, priming the cells for rapid biofilm formation. The formation of a small subpopulation of biofilm-ready bacteria serves as a bet- hedging strategy, ensuring overall population survival should conditions change rapidly from those in which planktonic growth is optimal to those in which adherence and biofilm formation is required.",NA,biorxiv

The occupancy of transcription factors (TFs) from ChIP-seq agrees well with an alternative method, chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC-seq2). However, ChIP-seq and ChEC-seq2 reveal strikingly different patterns of enrichment of yeast RNA polymerase II. We hypothesized that this reflects distinct populations of RNAPII, some of which are captured by ChIP-seq and some of which are captured by ChEC-seq2. RNAPII association with enhancers and promoters - predicted from biochemical studies - is detected well by ChEC-seq2 but not by ChIP-seq. Enhancer/promoter bound RNAPII correlates with transcription levels and matches predicted occupancy based on published rates of enhancer recruitment, preinitiation assembly, initiation, elongation and termination. The occupancy from ChEC-seq2 allowed us to develop a stochastic model for global kinetics of RNAPII transcription which captured both the ChEC-seq2 data and changes upon chemical-genetic perturbations to transcription. Finally, RNAPII ChEC-seq2 and kinetic modeling suggests that a mutation in the Gcn4 transcription factor that blocks interaction with the NPC destabilizes promoter-associated RNAPII without altering its recruitment to the enhancer.",NA,biorxiv

These proximal clusters, which have been labeled as cis-regulatory domains (CRDs), are thought to reflect topological features of the genome and may demarcate functional units linking genetic variation to transcriptional regulation. The problem of distinguishing CRDs from background variation is computationally difficult and current methods rely on greedy approaches with ad-hoc parameters and do not provide an assessment of statistical significance, an important consideration for investigating CRDs in small sample cohorts.

ResultsWe developed a software package, PEAS (Proximal Enrichment by Approximated Sampling), to identify CRDs from a small number of samples (as few as two distinct genetic backgrounds) using a robust statistical approach. PEAS uses methods for efficient and accurate estimation of empirical distributions to quantify the significance of enriched regions, followed by a dynamic programming algorithm to identify the minimum likelihood set of non-overlapping enriched regions. We used it to identify clusters of proximally-enriched differences in the histone mark H3K27ac between two mouse strains as well as proximally-enriched regions of correlation in this mark across five mouse strains.

Intermediates are important for folding fidelity; however, their structures have remained elusive. Here, we have structurally characterised two coTF intermediates of an immunoglobulin-like domain by developing comprehensive 19F NMR analyses using chemical shifts, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), and protein engineering. We integrated these experimental data with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain atomistic structures of the folding intermediates on the ribosome. The resulting intermediate structures are distinguished by native-like folds initiated from either their N-or C-termini, and reveal parallel folding pathways, which are structurally conserved within the protein domain family, in contrast to their in vitro refolding mechanisms.

The fusion of satellite cell-derived mononucleated muscle cells (SCMs) is indispensable for the generation of multinucleated, contractile myofibers during muscle repair. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying SCM fusion during muscle regeneration remain poorly understood. In this study, we uncovered an essential role for branched actin polymerization in SCM fusion. Using conditional knockouts of the Arp2/3 complex and its actin nucleation-promoting factors, N-WASP and WAVE, we demonstrated that branched actin polymerization is required for the SCM fusion, but not for satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. We showed that the N-WASP and WAVE complexes have partially redundant functions in regulating SCM fusion. Furthermore, we showed that branched actin polymerization is essential for generating invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapses in SCMs. Taken together, our study has identified new components of the myoblast fusion machinery in skeletal muscle regeneration and demonstrated a critical role for branched actin-propelled invasive protrusions in this process.",NA,biorxiv

ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify transdiagnostic patient clusters based on disease severity and explore the underlying biological mechanisms independently of the traditional categorical classification.

DesignWe utilized data from 443 participants diagnosed with SMD of the PsyCourse Study, a longitudinal study with deep phenotyping across up to four visits. We performed longitudinal clustering to group patients based on symptom trajectories and cognitive performance. The resulting clusters were compared on cross-sectional variables, including independent measures of severity as well as polygenic risk scores, serum protein quantification, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation.

ResultsWe identified two distinct clusters of patients that exhibited marked differences in illness severity but did not differ significantly in age, sex, or diagnostic proportions. We found 19 serum proteins significantly dysregulated between the two clusters. Functional enrichment pointed to a convergence of immune system dysregulation and neurodevelopmental processes.

ConclusionThe observed differences in serum protein expression suggest that disease severity is associated with the convergence of immune system dysregulation and neurodevelopmental alterations, particularly involving pathways related to inflammation and brain plasticity. The identification of pro-inflammatory proteins among the differentially expressed markers underscores the potential role of systemic inflammation in the pathophysiology of SMD. These results highlight the importance of considering illness severity as a core dimension in psychiatric research and clinical practice and suggest that targeting immune-related mechanisms may offer promising new therapeutic avenues for patients with SMD.

Key points

QuestionCan analyzing symptom trajectories and cognitive profiles across diagnostic categories reveal clinically relevant subgroups in severe mental disorders?

FindingsIn this longitudinal study of 443 individuals with severe mental disorders, two distinct clusters emerged, differing significantly in illness severity, with the more severe group displaying elevated pro-inflammatory serum proteins, suggesting an association between disease severity and inflammation.

MeaningThese findings suggest that transdiagnostic clustering clarifies shared mechanisms, underscores the importance of inflammation in severe mental disorders, and highlights a promising avenue for novel therapeutic approaches.",NA,biorxiv

The operating conditions for the bioreactor and the ecological interactions among functional populations are crucial in controlling this process, but they have not been completely ascertained. Here, we unraveled two operating conditions (i.e., environmental factors): (1) the substrate ratio of ethanol and lactate as co-electron donors, and (2) the temperature, which affected both the product specificity (i.e., function) and microbial dynamics of chain-elongating microbiomes in a continuously fed bioreactor with product extraction. Specifically, we found that the increase in the substrate ratio of ethanol to lactate shifted the microbiomes toward n-caprylate (C8) production, while the slightly higher operating temperatures of 37{degrees}C or 42{degrees}C were advantageous to n-caproate (C6) production. We detected a core microbiome that was similar for all environmental conditions and the two bioreactors, consisting of populations from Sphaerochaeta spp., Caproiciproducens spp., and Oscillospiraceae. Besides the core microbiome, we observed positive correlations between Erysipelaclostridiaceae UCG-004, Bacteroides spp., Oscillospiraceae NK4A214, Rikenellaceae RC9, and Pseudoclavibacter spp. with n-caprylate production. Similar populations compared to the core microbiome were positively correlated with n-caproate production. We showed that we can steer microbiomes toward a high specificity of certain medium-chain carboxylates.

Traditional approaches, including statistical, pedigree-based, and read-based phasing, face challenges such as limited accuracy for rare variants, reliance on external reference panels, and constraints in regions with sparse genetic variation.

To address these limitations, we developed TinkerHap, a novel and unique phasing algorithm that integrates a read-based phaser, based on a pairwise distance-based unsupervised classification, with external phased data, such as statistical or pedigree phasing. We evaluated TinkerHaps performance against other phasing algorithms using 1,040 parent-offspring trios from the UK Biobank (Illumina short-reads) and GIAB Ashkenazi trio (PacBio long-reads). TinkerHaps read-based phaser alone achieved higher phasing accuracies than all other algorithms with 95.1% for short-reads (second best: 94.8%) and 97.5% for long-reads (second best: 95.5%). Its hybrid approach further enhanced short-read performance to 96.3% accuracy and was able to phase 99.5% of all heterozygous sites. TinkerHap also extended haplotype block sizes to a median of 79,449 base-pairs for long-reads (second best: 68,303 bp) and demonstrated higher accuracy for both SNPs and indels. This combination of a robust read-based algorithm and hybrid strategy makes TinkerHap a uniquely powerful tool for genomic analyses.",NA,biorxiv

A substantial proportion of its 235kb genome is dedicated to manipulating host immunity through targeting antiviral host proteins for degradation or relocalisation. Quantitative proteomics of the infected cell has extensively characterised these processes, but the cell-free virion has been less well studied. We therefore carried out proteomic analysis of a clinical HCMV strain virion. This revealed multiple novel components, including the viral protein gpUL141, which is recognised as an NK immune-evasin that targets several host proteins (CD155, CD112, and TRAILR) when expressed in the cell. Co-Immunoprecipitation of gpUL141 from virions identified interactions with viral entry glycoproteins from the trimer (gH/gL/gO), pentamer (gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A), and gH/gpUL116 complexes, as well as gB. These interactions occurred via direct interactions between gpUL141 and either gH or gB. Analysis supported a model in which gpUL141 homodimers independently interacted with separate gB/gH-containing complexes. gpUL141 encodes an ER retention domain that restricts trafficking through the ER/golgi, and limited the transport of glycoprotein complexes bound by gpUL141. As a result, gpUL141 reduced levels of multiple glycoprotein complexes on the infected cell surface as well as in the virion. This reduced syncytia formation, inhibited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and reduced susceptibility to neutralising antibodies. Thus, gpUL141 represents an immune-evasin that not only targets host proteins to limit NK-cell attack, but also alters the trafficking of multiple viral glycoprotein complexes in order to evade humoral immunity.

SignificanceThe large number of immune-evasins encoded by HCMV has led to it becoming a paradigm for pathogen-mediated immune-modulation. These mechanisms have informed on virus pathogenesis, revealed the underlying function of human immunology, and identified therapeutic targets. Previously discovered immune-evasins functioned by modifying host proteins, gpUL141 represents a novel strategy in which multiple immunological functions are targeted through manipulating eight different viral entry glycoproteins, via interactions with two proteins common to multiple complexes. Entry glycoproteins define virus tropism, mechanisms of infection and spread, and susceptibility to neutralising and non-neutralising antibody activities, yet UL141 is frequently mutated in passaged HCMV strains. Since vaccines and immunotherapies exploit these functions, it is critical that gpUL141 activity is accounted for when assessing preclinical efficacy.",NA,biorxiv

The pathogen has already shown signs of host shift eastward to the hybrid populations between lodgepole pine and jack pine (Pinus contorta x P. banksiana), and possibly into pure jack pine. However, we have little knowledge about mechanisms of resistance to D. septosporum, especially the underlying genetic basis of variation in pines. In this study, we conducted controlled inoculations to induce infection by D. septosporum and performed a genome-wide case-control association study with pooled sequencing (pool-seq) data to dissect the genetic architecture underlying response in lodgepole pine, jack pine, and their hybrids. We identified candidate genes associated with D. septosporum response in lodgepole pine and in hybrid samples. We also assessed genetic structure in hybrid populations and inferred how introgression may affect the distribution of genetic variation involved in D. septosporum response in the studied samples.

Employing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we focus on elucidating the molecular intricacies of these secondary processes beyond primary nucleation. Central to our investigation is the analysis of a freely diffusing Abeta42 monomer on pre-formed fibril structures. We conduct detailed calculations of the monomers diffusion coefficient on fibril surfaces (as a one-dimensional case), along with various monomer orientations. Our findings reveal a strong and consistent correlation between the monomers diffusion coefficient and its orientation on the surface. Further analysis differentiates the effects of parallel and perpendicular alignments with respect to the fibril axis. Additionally, we explore how different fibril surfaces influencemonomer dynamics by comparing the C-terminal and N-terminal surfaces. We find that the monomer exhibits lower diffusion coefficients on the N-terminal surface. Differences in surface roughness (SR), quantified using root-mean-square distances, significantly affect monomer dynamics, thereby influencing the secondary aggregation process. Importanly, this study underscores that fibril twisting acts as a regulatory niche, selectively influencing these orientations and their diffusion properties necessary for facilitating fibril growth within biologically relevant time scales. This discovery opens new avenues for targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at manipulating fibril dynamics to mitigate the progression of Alzheimers disease.

To address this, there is growing interest in uncovering novel chemicals with analogous protective qualities. This may not only enhance vitrification efficacy but also mitigate toxic effects. In the current study, we employed a high throughput method to assess the toxicity of 21 compounds at room temperature, both individually and in binary combinations. Our analysis revealed that toxicity increases with both exposure duration and concentration, and that several CPA combinations result in reduced overall toxicity.

Adipose tissue has been proposed as a potential reservoir for viral persistence and tissue dysfunction contributing to symptomology seen in Long COVID. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from two cohorts: participants with subacute COVID-19 (28-89 days post-infection) compared to pre-pandemic controls, and participants with Long COVID compared to those with those classified as ""indeterminate"" based on the RECOVER-Adult Long COVID Research Index (12-47 months post-infection). We found no evidence of persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA in adipose tissue in any participant.

Simultaneously, the thioredoxin antioxidant system was upregulated, likely to limit oxidative damage. Additionally, we observed an integrated upregulation of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway during the initial regrowth phases, possibly to provide energy and supplying NADPH for biosynthesis and antioxidant responses. We show that this metabolic reprogramming is evolutionarily conserved, as a comparable one occurs in the pro-regenerative mammalian Pten and Socs3 co-deletion model.

Myxococcus xanthus, a soil-dwelling bacterium, employs aggregative multicellularity to form multicellular fruiting bodies that produce spores in response to starvation. Studies of natural fruiting bodies show that this process is restricted to close kin or clonemates. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying kin recognition during development in M. xanthus. By co-culturing two distantly related M. xanthus strains under vegetative and starvation conditions, we observed that the strains segregate in both contexts. During vegetative growth, one strain antagonized the other using the type VI secretion system (T6SS). T6SS-mediated antagonism was also observed during development, resulting in monoclonal fruiting bodies when WT strains were mixed. In contrast, mixtures of T6SS knockout strains formed chimeric fruiting bodies, that produced viable spores from both strains. These findings suggest that T6SS is the primary mechanism of kin discrimination in distantly related M. xanthus strains, and its use ensures the development of monoclonal fruiting bodies and social integrity.",NA,biorxiv

Facial movements are controlled, according to the dominant neuropsychological schema, by two separate circuits, one originating in medial frontal cortex controlling emotional expressions, and a second one originating in lateral motor and premotor areas controlling voluntary facial movements. Despite this functional dichotomy, cortical anatomy suggests that medial and lateral areas are directly connected and may thus operate as a single network. Here we test these contrasting hypotheses through structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) guided electrical stimulation and simultaneous multi-channel recordings from key face motor areas in the macaque monkey brain. These areas include medial face motor area M3 (located in the anterior cingulate cortex); two lateral face-related motor areas: M1 (primary motor) and PMv (ventrolateral premotor); and S1 (primary somatosensory cortex). Cortical responses evoked by intracortical stimulation revealed that medial and lateral areas can exert significant functional impact on each other. Simultaneous recordings of local field potentials in all face motor areas further confirm that during facial expressions, medial and lateral face motor areas significantly interact, primarily in the alpha and beta frequency ranges. These functional interactions varied across different types of facial movements. Thus, contrary to the dominant neuropsychological dogma, control of facial movements is not mediated through independent (medial/lateral) functional streams, but results from an extensive interacting sensorimotor network.",NA,biorxiv

ABR recordings showed similar hearing thresholds with peak sensitivity between 8 to 46 kHz for both species. We found that amplitude of ABR wave I and IV increased significantly with increasing intensity, while no main effect of species was detected. Latency of wave I and IV significantly decreased with increasing intensity in both species. Finally, we observed longer latencies of the binaural interaction component (BIC) at longer interaural time differences (ITDs) in P. leucopus, while no differences were observed across relative BIC amplitude between species. These results provide additional ABR related data that expands the use of both Peromyscus species as future models for auditory research.",NA,biorxiv

Recent advances in synthetic biology have enabled tools to reprogram entire developmental pathways; however, the complexity of designing synthetic genetic programs and the inherent interactions between various signaling processes remains a critical challenge. Here, we leverage Type-B response regulators to modulate the expression of genes involved in cytokinin-dependent growth and development processes. We rationally engineered these regulators to modulate their transcriptional activity (i.e., repression or activation), potency, and sensitivity to cytokinin. By localizing the expression of these engineered TFs using tissue-specific promoters, we can precisely tune cytokinin-regulated traits. As a proof of principle, we deployed this synthetic system in Arabidopsis thaliana to either decrease or increase the number of lateral roots. The simplicity and modularity of our approach makes it an ideal system for controlling other developmental phenotypes of agronomic interest in plants.",NA,biorxiv

Using zebrafish oocytes, eggs and embryos as a model system, we discovered PITHD1 as an endogenous inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. Our high-resolution cryoEM structure reveals that PITHD1 simultaneously blocks three crucial functional sites on the 19S regulatory particle which are required for ubiquitin recognition, processing, and substrate translocation. This triple-lock mechanism effectively prevents protein degradation in dormant cells. Given PITHD1s evolutionary conservation across species, this mechanism likely represents a general strategy for reversible proteasome regulation during cellular dormancy.

Insular populations are particularly interesting as they have often persisted at low population sizes and higher inbreeding than their mainland counterparts. While the genome-wide consequences of inbreeding in threatened insular species have received some attention, comparative genomics between insular and mainland populations of wide-spread and genetically diverse species have rarely been performed. Yet, they are particularly well suited to inform about the consequences of drastic population declines from initially large populations - a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly common. The spot-nosed monkey (Cercopithecus petaurista), the Campbells monkey (Cercopithecus campbelli) and the green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) are common and genetically diverse West African primates. Insular populations can be found at the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau. Here, we assessed the genome-wide diversity, inbreeding, genetic load and adaptive variation using whole genome sequencing data from insular and mainland populations. In the three species, island populations showed lower genome-wide diversity and higher inbreeding. Genetic drift has likely promoted the conversion of masked genetic load into realized load without increased purging of deleterious variation. Additionally, we found no evidence for accumulation of deleterious variation, suggesting that these populations are not yet at risk of extinction by genetic factors and may act as reservoirs of mainland genetic diversity. We highlight, however, that other anthropogenic factors are threatening these insular primates and therefore conservation management should target their immediate threats and safeguard against additional loss of diversity.",NA,biorxiv

LON-1 is a secreted protein with a conserved CAP domain and a C-terminal unstructured domain with no homology to other proteins. In this study, we report that the C-Terminal Domain (CTD) of LON-1 is dispensable for its function. Instead, key conserved residues located in the CAP domain are critical for LON-1 function in vivo.

TrAEL-seq is a robust method for profiling DNA replication genome-wide that works in unsynchronised cells and does not require treatment with drugs or nucleotide analogues. Here, we provide an updated method for TrAEL-seq including multiplexing of up to 6 samples that dramatically improves sample quality and throughput, and we validate TrAEL-seq in multiple mammalian cell lines. The updated protocol is straightforward and robust yet provides excellent resolution comparable to OK-seq in mammalian cell samples. High resolution replication profiles can be obtained across large panels of samples and in dynamic systems, for example during the progressive onset of oncogene induced senescence. In addition to mapping zones where replication initiates and terminates, TrAEL-seq is sensitive to replication fork speed, revealing effects of both transcription and proximity to replication Initiation Zones on fork progression. Although forks move more slowly through transcribed regions, this does not have a significant impact on the broader dynamics of replication fork progression, which is dominated by rapid fork movement in long replication regions (>1Mb). Short and long replication regions are not intrinsically different, and instead replication forks accelerate across the first [~]1 Mb of travel such that forks progress faster in the middle of regions lying between widely spaced Initiation Zones. We propose that this is a natural consequence of fewer replication forks being active later in S phase when these distal regions are replicated and there being less competition for replication factors.",NA,biorxiv

The HERG channel plays a critical role in the repolarization of the myocardial action potential, and loss-of-function mutations prolong cardiac repolarization.

MethodsIn this study, we investigated the efficacy and underlying molecular mechanism of ICA-105574, an HERG activator, in shortening the duration of cardiac repolarization in severe LQT2 variants. We characterized the efficacy of ICA-105574 in vivo, using an animal model to assess its ability to shorten the QT interval and in vitro, in cellular models mimicking severe HERG channel mutations (A561V, G628S, and L779P) to evaluate its impact in enhancing IKr current. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the molecular mechanism of ICA-105574 action.

ResultsIn vivo, ICA-105574 significantly shortened the QT interval. LQT2 mutations drastically reduced IKr amplitude and suppressed tail currents in cellular models. ICA-105574 restored IKr in A561V and G628S. Finally, in silico data showed that ICA-105574 stabilizes a pattern of interactions similar to gain-of-function SQT1 mutations and can reverse the G628S modifications, through an allosteric network linking the binding site to the selectivity filter and the S5P turret helix, thereby restoring its K+ ion permeability.

ConclusionsOur results support the development of HERG activators like ICA-105574 as promising pharmacological molecules against some severe LQT2 mutations and suggest that molecular dynamics simulations can be used to test the ability of molecules to modulate HERG function in silico, paving the way for the rational design of new HERG activators.",NA,biorxiv

Wild-type fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, can gain resistance to insults such as caffeine and antifungal compounds through reversible epimutations. Resistant epimutants exhibit histone H3K9 methylation-dependent heterochromatin islands at various chromosomal locations, reducing expression of underlying genes. Two genes whose heterochromatin island-induced repression causes resistance encode mitochondrial proteins: the LYR domain protein Cup1 and the Cox1 translation regulator Ppr4. Genetic mutations, cup1-tt and ppr4{Delta}, that phenocopy their respective epimutants, cause mitochondrial dysfunction, including respiratory deficiency, poor growth on non-glucose carbon sources, and elevated reactive oxygen species. RNA-Seq analyses indicate that cup1-tt and ppr4{Delta} cells activate the mitonuclear retrograde pathway and the Pap1 transcription factor-dependent oxidative stress response pathways. Both mutants show increased nuclear localisation of Pap1 and its recruitment to promoters of genes encoding oxidoreductases and membrane transporters, causing increased efflux activity. cup1 and ppr4 epimutants also show mitochondrial dysfunction phenotypes and increased efflux, explaining how heterochromatin-island epimutations cause drug resistance. Thus, wild-type cells harness epimutations that impose mitochondrial dysfunction to bypass external insults. As mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to antifungal resistance in several fungi, similar epimutations likely contribute to development of resistance in fungal pathogens.",NA,biorxiv

Effector CD4+ T cells (CD4+ Teffs) are critical for antitumor immunity, but their function is often inhibited by regulatory T cells (Tregs), which accumulate in lung tumors and perform suppressive functions through multiple mechanisms. This suppression leads to tumor progression and poor patient outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying Treg-mediated suppression are not fully understood. Here, we identify the extracellular ATP receptor P2RX7 as a key regulator of Treg function in lung tumors. Using a murine lung cancer model induced by Lewis lung carcinoma cells, we demonstrate that P2RX7 enhances the suppressive capacity of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, promoting tumor growth. In T cell-specific P2RX7-KO mice, reduced Treg infiltration was accompanied by increased CD4+ Teff accumulation and improved tumor control. Treg-specific P2RX7-KO mice exhibit reduced tumor growth, confirming a cell-intrinsic role of P2RX7 in Tregs. Suppression assays revealed that tumor-infiltrating WT Tregs have greater suppressive activity compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs, which failed to inhibit type 1 and Tfh-like responses. This was associated with increased tumor-specific IgG production by lung B cells in P2RX7-KO mice. We also observed that WT Tregs express higher levels of the immunosuppressive surface molecule CTLA-4 when compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs. In summary, we show that P2RX7 expression on Tregs is essential for their suppressive function in lung cancer, and targeting of P2RX7 may constitute a novel strategy to improve lung cancer treatment by alleviating Treg-mediated immune suppression.",NA,biorxiv

We compiled demographic time series from 87 populations for 66 animal species spanning 12 taxonomic classes to test whether sociality promotes demographic buffering and whether this relationship depends on environmental context. Using stochastic elasticities and phylogenetically comparative analyses, we find broad support for the social buffering hypothesis: more social species exhibit lower sensitivity of population growth to vital rate variance (lower stochastic elasticity to vital rate variances, |T{sigma}|), particularly in juvenile survival and reproduction. Contrary to expectations, juvenile vital rates, but not adult survival, showed the strongest buffering patterns in social taxa, suggesting life-stage-specific social mechanisms. Furthermore, we show that social species invest more in maximising the average performance of adult survival and reproduction (higher stochastic elasticity to vital rate means, T), consistent with adaptive strategies favouring canalisation of fitness-related traits. This buffering benefit is especially relevant in highly unpredictable environments: in climates with erratic precipitation, social species have greater demographic advantages, exhibiting even lower T{sigma} values. Together, these findings provide support for the social buffering hypothesis, especially in highly stochastic environments. Social traits confer some demographic stability under moderate climatic conditions, but may become more relevant under extreme stochasticity--an insight particularly important for understanding population resilience in a rapidly changing world.",NA,biorxiv

To understand the mechanisms of early pathogenesis for both fungi, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of infected hAECs. Analysis revealed that both fungi induced cellular stress and cytokine production. However, the cell subtypes affected and specific pathways differed between fungi, with A. fumigatus and C. posadasii triggering protein-folding-related stress in ciliated cells and hypoxia responses in secretory cells, respectively.

This quick protocol employs the efficient single-stranded DNA annealing protein (SSAP) CspRecT to incorporate (libraries of) DNA oligos harboring the desired mutations into a target plasmid in E. coli.

Progress in the field however has been hampered by the lack of openly available datasets that can be exploited by researchers across disciplines to develop methods that would address the unique challenges associated with imaging and analysing functional brain in utero, such as unconstrained head motion, dynamically evolving geometric distortions, or inherently low signal-to-noise ratio. Here we describe the developing Human Connectome Projects release of the largest open access fetal fMRI dataset to date, containing 275 scans from 255 fetuses and spanning the period of 20.86 to 38.29 post-menstrual weeks. We present a systematic approach to its pre-processing, implementing multi-band soft SENSE reconstruction, dynamic distortion corrections via phase unwrapping method, slice-to-volume reconstruction and a tailored temporal filtering model, with attention to the prominent sources of structured noise in the in utero fMRI. The dataset is accompanied with an advanced registration infrastructure, enabling group-level data fusion, and contains outputs from the main intermediate processing steps. This allows for various levels of data exploration by the imaging and neuroscientific community, starting from the development of robust pipelines for anatomical and temporal corrections to methods for elucidating the development of functional connectivity in utero. By providing a high-quality template for further method development and benchmarking, the release of the dataset will help to advance fetal fMRI to its deserved and timely place at the forefront of the efforts to build a life-long connectome of the human brain.",10.1162/imag_a_00512,biorxiv

To promote the expression of target genes, two ChREBP-MLX heterodimers form a heterotetramer to bind a tandem element with two adjacent E-boxes, called Carbohydrate Responsive Element (ChoRE). How the ChREBP-MLX hetero-tetramerization is achieved and regulated, remains poorly understood. Here we show that MLX phosphorylation on an evolutionarily conserved motif is necessary for the heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE and the transcriptional activity of the ChREBP-MLX complex. We identified CK2 and GSK3 as MLX kinases that coordinately phosphorylate MLX. High intracellular glucose-6-phosphate accumulation inhibits MLX phosphorylation and heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE, impairing ChREBP-MLX activity. Physiologically, MLX phosphorylation is necessary in Drosophila to maintain sugar tolerance and lipid homeostasis. Our findings suggest that MLX phosphorylation is a key mechanism for the ChREBP-MLX heterotetramer formation to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.",NA,biorxiv

The interaction between plants aboveground has been studied and incorporated into breeding programs that select for plants that reduce aboveground competition between plants. However, few studies have focused on belowground interactions, and these looked at combined interactions and root partitioning in the soil. This study focuses on the developmental and physiological responses of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) genotypes to neighboring sorghum plants. In this study, we used two growing methods: i) a focal plant surrounded by neighboring plants in the same pot but without shading, and ii) a focal plant grown either alone or surrounded by neighbors, irrigated with nutrient solution passed through pots (leachates) with or without plants. Our results showed that the presence of neighbors in the same pot led to reduced size-dry weight height, and leaf area of the focal plant. In addition, the presence of neighbors reduced stomatal conductance and PSII quantum yield. While the response direction was similar across tested genotypes, the magnitude varied. The results were repeated when neighboring plants were not grown in the same pot, but the nutrient solution passed through the root system of plants of the neighboring genotype. Furthermore, we saw a reduction in assimilation rate and stomatal conductance when plants were exposed to either the physical presence of neighbors or leachate. We did not find differences in root architecture in either treatment. These results show plants change their growth in response to neighbors and that the signal is carried through the liquid phase of the soil. Our findings provide insights into sorghum plants responses to below-ground signaling from neighboring plants and lay the foundation for future studies enabling increased crop performance under high-density planting conditions.",NA,biorxiv

Based on gene expression profiling, B-ALL can be classified into distinct transcriptional subtypes with differing disease outcomes. Many of these transcriptional subtypes are defined by mutations in transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes, but how such diverse mutations lead to distinct transcriptional subtypes remains unclear. To illuminate the chromatin regulatory landscape in B-ALL, we analyzed 3D genome organization, open chromatin, and gene expression in 53 primary patient samples. At the level of 3D genome organization, we identified chromatin interactions that vary across transcriptional subtypes. These sites of variable 3D chromatin interactions correlate with local gene expression changes and are enriched for core drivers of B-ALL observed in genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screens. Sites of variable 3D genome interactions are frequently shared across multiple transcriptional subtypes and are enriched for open chromatin sites found in normal B-cell development but repressed in mature B-cells. Within an individual patient sample, the chromatin landscape can resemble progenitor chromatin states at some loci and mature B-cell chromatin at others, suggesting that the chromatin in B-ALL patient tumor cells is in a partially arrested immature state. By analyzing transcriptomic data from large cohorts of B-ALL patients, we identify gene expression programs that are shared across transcriptional subtypes, associated with B-cell developmental stages, and predictive of patient survival. In combination, these results show that the 3D genome organization of B-ALL reflects B-cell developmental stages and helps illustrate how B-cell developmental arrest interacts with transcriptional subtypes to drive B-ALL.",NA,biorxiv

Further analyses examined the relationship between seizure durations, inter-seizure intervals, and dominant EEG power.

However, integrating data sets from different studies remains a challenging problem because of severe batch effects, unobserved confounding variables, and high heterogeneity across data sets. We propose a new data integration method called MetaDICT, which initially estimates the batch effects by weighting methods in causal inference literature and then refines the estimation via novel shared dictionary learning. Compared with existing methods, MetaDICT can better avoid the overcorrection of batch effects and preserve biological variation when there exist unobserved confounding variables, data sets are highly heterogeneous across studies, or the batch is completely confounded with some covariates. Furthermore, MetaDICT can generate comparable embedding at both taxa and sample levels that can be used to unravel the hidden structure of the integrated data and improve the integrative analysis. Applications to synthetic and real microbiome data sets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of MetaDICT in integrative analysis. Using MetaDICT, we characterize microbial interaction, identify generalizable microbial signatures, and enhance the accuracy of outcome prediction in two real integrative studies, including an integrative analysis of colorectal cancer metagenomics studies and a meta-analysis of immunotherapy microbiome studies.",NA,biorxiv

In humans, mutations in telomere regulatory genes lead to short or long telomere syndromes. These syndromes often show genetic anticipation, where disease has earlier onset and a more severe manifestation in each new generation. Later generations inherit not only the mutation affecting telomere length, but also abnormal length telomeres.

Many aspects of telomere length homeostasis are conserved between mammals and yeast. Here we explored telomere length inheritance patterns through the sexual cycle in yeast. Analysis of single telomeres, rather than bulk telomeres, shows that if haploid yeast with short telomeres mate with wild-type yeast creating diploids, short telomere lengths rapidly normalize (within 30 cell divisions). However, long telomeres inherited from one parent can persist for more than 200 mitotic cell divisions. Long telomere can also be transmitted through more than one round of meiosis, independently of mutations that cause long telomeres. These patterns, along with haploinsufficiency effects, show that even in yeast there is a complex relationship between telomere length, telomere length inheritance, and mutations that affect telomere length. Our findings may have implications for families affected by telomere syndromes.

Article summaryTelomeres protect the ends of chromosomes from DNA damage responses. In humans, mutations causing short or long telomeres, lead to inherited disease syndromes, often showing evidence of genetic anticipation. Here we show that in budding yeast, long telomeres can be transmitted through several generations in the absence of mutations causing the long telomere phenotype. Therefore, even in a simple single-celled eukaryotic organism, complex patterns of telomere length inheritance occur.

Its strict intracellular lifestyle and challenges in in vitro cultivation have impeded detailed metabolic characterization. In this study, we present iTP251, the first genome-scale metabolic model of T. pallidum, reconstructed and extensively curated to capture its unique metabolic features. These refinements included the curation of key reactions such as pyrophosphate-dependent phosphorylation and pathways for nucleotide synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and cofactor metabolism. The model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, validated by a MEMOTE score of 92%. To further enhance its predictive capabilities, we developed ec-iTP251, an enzyme-constrained version of iTP251, incorporating enzyme turnover rate and molecular weight information for all reactions having gene-protein-reaction associations. Ec-iTP251 provides detailed insights into protein allocation across carbon sources, showing strong agreement with proteomics data (Pearsons correlation of 0.88) in the central carbon pathway. Moreover, the thermodynamic analysis revealed that lactate uptake serves as an additional ATP-generating strategy to utilize unused proteomes, albeit at the cost of reducing the driving force of the central carbon pathway by 27%. Subsequent analysis identified glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an alternative electron sink, compensating for the absence of a conventional electron transport chain while maintaining cellular redox balance. These findings highlight T. pallidums metabolic adaptations for survival and redox balance in intracellular environments, providing a foundation for future research into its unique bioenergetics.

Although significant functional coupling (i.e. cortico-muscular coherence [CMC]) has been shown between cortical and lower-limb muscle activity during steady-state walking, little is known about CMC in locomotor adaptation. Therefore, we investigated the adaptation-dependent modulation of the CMC between the sensorimotor region and the tibialis anterior muscle using a split-belt locomotor adaptation paradigm that can impose an asymmetric perturbation. We hypothesized that the CMC would temporarily decrease after exposure to the asymmetric perturbation and removal of the perturbation because of a mismatch between the predicted and actual sensory feedback. We also hypothesized that the CMC would increase as adaptation and de-adaptation to perturbation progressed because the motor system could become able to predict sensory feedback. Our findings revealed that the CMC temporarily decreased after exposure to and removal of the perturbation. Moreover, the CMC increased with adaptation and de-adaptation to perturbation. Although these results depend on the leg, frequency bands, and gait phases, they partially support our hypothesis. These findings suggest that flexible updating of cortico-muscular coupling in the motor system is a key mechanism underlying locomotor adaptation in humans.

However, the strategies employed by soybean to tolerate such conditions remain poorly understood. This study elucidates the interactions of host factors, and microbial associations using multi-omics approaches in Clark (tolerant) and Arisoy (sensitive) genotypes exposed to Fe deficiency and drought. Clark exhibited resilience to stress through sustained osmotic regulation, nutrient uptake, and photosynthetic activity, in contrast to Arisoy. Particularly, Fe retention in Clark, accompanied by the upregulation of ferritin-like proteins, may mitigate oxidative stress by reducing Fenton reactions. Furthermore, higher jasmonic and salicylic acid levels in Clark may contribute to its enhanced stress adaptation compared to Arisoy. RNA-seq analysis revealed 818 and 500 upregulated, along with 931 and 361 downregulated genes, in the roots of Clark and Arisoy, respectively, under stress. We observed the upregulation of symbiotic genes, such as Chalcone-flavonone isomerase 1 and SWEET10, accompanied by increased rhizosphere siderophore and root flavonoid in Clark. This indicates a significant role of microbes in mediating differential stress tolerance in soybean. Particularly, the combined stress led to distinct root and nodule microbiome dynamics, with Clark recruiting beneficial microbes such as Variovorax and Paecilomyces, whereas Arisoy exhibited the opposite pattern. In addition, Clark maintained nodule Bradyrhizobium and tissue nitrogen status, supported by ammonium retention and induction of Ammonium transporter 1 in the roots. Furthermore, in vitro compatibility between V. paradoxus and P. lilacinus suggests a synergistic interaction, with their localized signals benefiting Clark. Remarkably, enriched microbiomes significantly improved growth parameters, accompanied by elevated rhizosphere siderophore in sensitive genotypes under stress. This study is the first to uncover mechanisms of dual stress tolerance in soybean that may offer promising targets for breeding programs and microbiome-based biofertilizer strategies to improve combined stress tolerance in soybean and other legumes.

Fusogenic proteins are classified into structural classes that function with remarkable mechanistic similarities. Fusion proceeds through coordinated movements of protein domains in a sequence of orchestrated steps. Structures for the initial and final conformations are available for several fusogens, but folding intermediates have largely remained unresolved and interdependency between regions that drive conformational rearrangements is not well understood. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) particles display heterodimers of envelope proteins E1 and E2 associated as trimeric spikes that respond to acidic pH to trigger fusion. We have followed experimental evolution of CHIKV under the selective pressure of a novel small-molecule entry inhibitor. Mutations arising from selection mapped to two residues located in distal domains of E2 and E1 heterodimer and spikes. Here, we pinpointed the antiviral mode of action to inhibition of fusion. Phenotypic characterization of recombinant viruses indicated that the selected mutations confer a fitness advantage under antiviral pressure, and that the double-mutant virus overcame antiviral inhibition of fusion while single-mutants were sensitive. Further supporting a functional connection between residues, the double-mutant virus displayed a higher pH-threshold for fusion than single-mutant viruses. Finally, mutations implied distinct outcomes of replication and spreading in mice, and infection rates in mosquitoes underscoring the fine-tuning of envelope protein function as a determinant for establishment of infection. Together with molecular dynamics simulations that indicate a link between these two residues in the modulation of the heterodimer conformational rearrangement, our approach captured an otherwise unresolved interaction.

ImportanceCHIKV is a reemergent pathogen that has caused large outbreaks in the twenty years. There are no available antiviral therapies and a vaccine has only recently been approved. Here, we describe the mode of action of a novel inhibitor designed against CHIKV envelope proteins heterodimer that blocks entry at the stage of fusion between virus and host membranes. Fusion is common to the entry of enveloped viruses. Virus envelope proteins drive fusion undergoing a series of transitions from an initial metastable conformational state to a more stable post-fusion state. Intermediate conformations are transient and have mostly remained inaccessible to structure determination. In this study, directed evolution of resistance to antiviral inhibition of fusion uncovered a functional interaction between two residues residing in domains that are apart in both the pre-fusion and post-fusion states. Thus, our approach allowed gaining insight into the molecular detail of the inner working of virus fusion machinery.",NA,biorxiv

Dynamic alteration of the tRNA modifications, particularly under stress, are conserved gene regulatory mechanisms employed by cells across the kingdoms of life. The malaria-causing Plasmodium falciparum, which has a highly AT-biased genome, is reliant on a non-redundant set of tRNA genes to decode distinct and codon-skewed transcriptomes across its developmental stages. This genomic feature highlights the regulatory potential of tRNA modifications and warrants studies on how the tRNA epitranscriptome can impact gene regulatory function in this parasite.

We replicate work from rodents showing amplified low-frequency oscillations, but extend these findings with novel tools for characterising the organisation and dynamics of complex low-frequency spatiotemporal fields of neural activity. We find that 5-MeO-DMT radically reorganises low-frequency flows of neural activity, causing them to become incoherent, heterogeneous, viscous, fleeting, nonrecurring, and to cease their typical travelling forwards and backwards across the cortex compared to resting state. Further, we find a consequence of this reorganisation in broadband activity, which exhibits slower, more stable, low-dimensional behaviour, with increased energy barriers to rapid global shifts. These findings provide the first detailed empirical account of how 5-MeO-DMT sculpts human brain dynamics, revealing a novel set of cortical slow wave behaviours, with significant implications for extant neuroscientific models of serotonergic psychedelics.",NA,biorxiv

However, estimates of real-world fitness impact have been lacking. To address this gap, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian phylodynamic model to quantify contributions of resistance determinants to strain success in a 20-year collection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates. Fitness contributions varied with antibiotic use, and genetic pathways to phenotypically identical resistance conferred distinct fitness effects. These findings were supported by in vitro and experimental infection competition. Quantifying these fitness contributions to lineage dynamics reveals opportunities for investigation into other genetic and environmental drivers of fitness. This work thus establishes a method for linking pathogen genomics and antibiotic use to define factors shaping ecological trends.",NA,biorxiv

However, the underlying mechanisms of allospecific vocal imitation are poorly understood. Parrots and corvids are well known for their imitation abilities, but imitation accuracy has not yet been studied across species in a comparative context. We compared imitation accuracy between nine parrot species and European starlings based on imitation of monophonic and multiphonic sounds, produced by the Star Wars droid R2-D2. Our results show that starlings were better at imitating multiphonic sounds than parrots. However, no difference in imitation accuracy was found between parrots and starlings when imitating monophonic sounds. The differences in imitating accuracy are likely based on a physiological difference in syrinx anatomy, rather than on perceptual or cognitive differences between starlings and parrots. Between our nine tested parrot species, we found that parrots with larger brains (e.g., African greys and amazon parrots) were less accurate at imitating monophonic sounds than smaller brained budgerigars and cockatiels. The use of citizen science in our study shows the great potential this has to expand data collection beyond traditional studies. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolution of communication complexity in vocal learners.

Significance StatementVocal imitation is a hallmark of complex communication in animals, yet the mechanisms driving species differences remain poorly understood. By comparing vocal imitation across nine parrot species and European starlings, we demonstrate, for the first time, that differences in syrinx anatomy, rather than cognitive or perceptual capacities, underlie species-specific variation in imitation accuracy. Contrary to traditional expectations, smaller-brained parrots outperformed larger-brained species in monophonic sound imitation. These findings challenge assumptions that brain size is directly linked to imitation accuracy and offer insights into the evolution of complex communication. We used citizen science to create a uniquely large dataset of species imitating the same source, demonstrating the powerful potential of this approach to broaden research in comparative cognition and vocal learning.",NA,biorxiv

Many pathways, for example, generate either sustained or pulsatile responses depending on the context, and such diverse temporal behaviors have a profound impact on cell fate. Here we focus on how molecular pathways can convert the temporal features of dynamic signals, in particular how they can convert transient signals into persistent downstream events and vice versa. We describe this type of behavior as temporal dose inversion, and we demonstrate that it can be achieved through adaptive molecular circuits. We consider motifs known as incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL) and negative feedback loop (NFL), and identify parametric conditions that enable temporal dose inversion. We next consider more complex versions of these circuits that could be realized using enzymatic signaling and gene regulatory networks, finding that both circuits can exhibit temporal dose inversion. Finally, we consider a generalized IFFL topology, and we find that both the time delay in the inhibition pathway and the relative signal intensities of the activation and inhibition signals are key determinants for temporal dose inversion. Our investigation expands the potential use of adaptive circuits as signal processing units and contributes to our understanding of the role of adaptive circuits in nature.",NA,biorxiv

Parthenium beetle (Zygogramma bicolorata) exhibits an extremely high mating rate, with each mating typically lasting several hours. We investigated mating behaviour in this beetle to assess if there is sexual conflict. Theories of sexual conflict predict that such mating behaviour, while being beneficial to the males, should be detrimental to the females with regard to reproduction and/or survival. We experimentally manipulated the length and number of matings, and examined the effect on fecundity and survivorship of the females. While long mating has previously been identified as a mate-guarding strategy that benefits the males, our data reveal that it is detrimental to female fitness, supporting the sexual conflict hypothesis. Further, we checked natural variation in mating duration and its correlation with key fitness components. Our results show that female longevity is negatively correlated to reproductive rate, but positively correlated to lifetime reproduction. We argue that such a pattern is consistent with sexual conflict. While being the first clear demonstration of sexual conflict in this species, we discuss its significance, including a potential role in reducing its efficacy as a biocontrol.",NA,biorxiv

Here we assessed how learned sound-safety association alters neuronal activity in tail of the striatum (TS), where auditory cortical and thalamic inputs converge. Prior to training, foot shock elicited responses by TS direct and indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs), while sound tones produced no response. However, once the sound association was learned, sound tones strongly activated TS SPNs, even when the animal was under anesthesia. This conditioned auditory response occurred concurrently with alterations of direct pathway SPNs in the TS, including increased responses to cortical and auditory thalamic inputs, increased excitatory response with an enhanced ratio of NMDA to AMPA receptors, decreased responses to inhibitory input, and increased dendritic spines. This convergence of postsynaptic changes provides responses to relevant auditory cues during associative learning.

The radiobiological factors unique to carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT), such as high linear energy transfer (LET) and less dependence on oxygen, make it well-suited to overcome the PDAC TME. Here, we utilized clonal syngeneic KPC pancreatic tumor cell lines and tumors to examine this postulate and to identify underlying factors that impact the response of PDAC to CIRT. While KPC cell lines exhibited radiobiologic effectiveness (RBE) greater than 3, subcutaneous tumors in the mouse hind leg showed lower RBEs - 1.3 based on quintupling time - at a LET of 75 keV/m. Four days after CIRT, we observed widespread transcriptomic changes in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME), suggesting increased infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells, elevated expression of anti-tumor T cell cytokines, MHC class I molecules, and co-stimulatory signals. Fewer immunologic changes were observed following photon irradiation. By seven days after CIRT, tumor-supportive transcriptomic programs characterized by pro-tumor cytokines, M2 macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) emerged, promoting resistance and limiting the durability of tumor growth delay. These findings suggest that CIRT may offer a favorable platform compared to conventional photon radiation therapy for combining with immunotherapies.

Here we investigate the presence and distribution of a subclass of IS5 elements throughout genomes of Pseudomonas syringae, by querying complete genomes for the presence of InsH (the main transposase found within these IS5 elements). We report that this one subclass of IS5 elements appears to have recently undergone multiple independent expansions in P. syringae clades and find that a majority of IS5 insertion sites are not conserved across three closely related P. syringae pv. lachrymans genomes. We present further evidence, as has been shown for other members of the IS5 family in different taxa, that elements from this IS5 subclass can drive the expression of downstream genes in P. syringae.

To explore its physiological responses to extreme cold, uncover functional genes, and clarify their ecological roles, efficient genetic tools are essential. However, existing genetic manipulation methods in Pseudoalteromonas rely on traditional homology-based recombination, which is inefficient and time-consuming. Consequently, improving editing efficiency is crucial for advancing both basic research and applied potential. Here, we introduced the CRISPR/Cas9 system into Pseudoalteromonas for the first time, and conducted an extensive investigation into the application of the Type II CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene editing in Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea, a representative species thriving in the frigid polar oceans. To validate the feasibility of the CRISPR/Cas system in P. fuliginea, multiple genes were selected as targets and confirmed the gene editing effects through phenotypic changes or gene expression. We have successfully achieved both gene knockouts and insertions in P. fuliginea, encompassing the deletion of genes such as fliJ, indA, and genes encoding Pf sRNAs, as well as the in vivo insertion of 3xflag and the gfp gene. The average CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing efficiency in P. fuliginea exceeded 70% (range: 73.3%-95.8%), which is significantly higher than the traditional homology-based approach (less than 0.1%). In summary, we developed an efficient CRISPR/Cas9-based editing system in P. fuliginea, which can be utilized to accelerate the development of Pseudoalteromonas as a model system for addressing fundamental questions related to extreme environmental adaptation and to fulfill its potential biotechnological applications.

IMPORTANCEPseudoalteromonas fuliginea is a marine bacterium with great potential for ecological and biotechnological research, yet its genetic manipulation has long been a technical challenge. In this study, we developed a gene editing system based on CRISPR technology that enables efficient and precise genome modification in this organism. Using this system, we successfully deleted, inserted, and tagged multiple genes, including regulatory and non-coding elements, with high success rates. Notably, several of these genes are linked to key traits such as motility and stress response, which contribute to microbial adaptation in polar environments. This tool allows researchers to directly test gene function and study microbial adaptation in cold marine environments. The ability to perform reliable genetic edits in Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea opens new possibilities for its use as a model organism and will support future advances in microbial ecology, environmental microbiology, and marine biotechnology.",NA,biorxiv

Feeding HTL process water to anaerobic digestion (AD) is a promising approach for maximizing resource recovery, enabling the conversion of the retained carbon into biogas. However, various toxic and poorly biodegradable compounds in HTL process water make its treatment with AD challenging. Presently, the underlying mechanisms remain often unclear. We investigated the impact of HTL process water from two different feedstocks - a food-waste proxy (i.e., dog food, rich in proteins) and wheat straw (rich in lignocellulose) - on the different trophic groups in the food web of AD. We found that methanogens rather than acidogens were inhibited by HTL process water. Comparative toxicity and biodegradability analyses showed that wheat-straw process water had a higher biodegradability regardless of its higher toxicity to acetoclastic methanogens than food-waste process water, due to its higher content in toxic but easily degradable aromatic compounds. Microaeration enhanced the biodegradation and methane yields of food-waste process water, particularly under anoxic conditions. However, microaeration was ineffective for wheat-straw process water.

Here, we estimated functional dispersion during naturalistic movie watching in both younger (N=72, 34 female, 19-36 yrs) and older (N=68, 36 female, 65-82 yrs) adult groups with 7T MRI scanner and assessed their emotion regulation difficulties, anxiety, and depression symptoms as indicators of mental health status. The results demonstrated that greater FPN dispersion (i.e., more dissimilar connectivity) was linked to increased depressive symptoms in older adults and highlighted emotion regulation difficulties as a full mediator of this relationship. Moreover, FPN dispersion could distinguish emotionally resilient from vulnerable older individuals. These findings suggest that functional dedifferentiation of the FPN during ecologically valid emotional context constitutes a promising neural signature of affective vulnerability in older adults.

While determining error rates is illuminating, understanding why certain mistranslation events are enriched requires further exploration, particularly in relation to the translation-accuracy hypothesis. We found that codons favored in highly expressed genes are not predictive of translational fidelity and are not selected for translational accuracy. We evaluated our method using historically characterized ribosomal variants of Escherichia coli reported to differ in translation fidelity. However, we found no significant differences among their overall translation-error rates, estimated here to be [~]2 per 1,000 amino acids. Instead they each exhibited unique mistranslation profiles, which likely led to prior overestimates of the translation error-rate in the putative error-prone variant.

As a motivating example, recent work suggested applying sex-stratified meta-analysis to correct for participation bias, without considering that men and women from the same population will be highly related. Our theory demonstrates how cryptic relatedness results in correlated test statistics between studies, inflating meta-analysis. We characterize the effects of different between-study relatedness scenarios, particularly population structure and recent family relatedness, on meta-analysis type I error control and power. We simulated data with (1) no family relatedness between subpopulations, (2) family relatedness within subpopulations, (3) family relatedness across subpopulations, and (4) single population with family relatedness. We run joint and meta-analyses on simulations using both binary and quantitative traits. In scenarios with family relatedness, sex-stratified meta-analysis exhibits severe inflation and lower AUC compared to joint and subpopulation meta-analyses. Remarkably, genomic control succeeds in correcting inflation in these cases, but does not alter calibrated power. Analysis of real datasets confirms severe inflation for sex-stratified meta-analysis in family studies, but a negligible effect for population studies with up to 10,000 individuals. Our theoretical framework demonstrates that the inflation factor increases as the sample size increases. We recommend against meta-analyzing studies that share the same populations, which increases the risk of inflation due to cryptic relatedness between studies.",NA,biorxiv

The PTSNtr is comprised of three enzymes: first PtsP, then the PtsO phosphocarrier, and the final PtsN phosphoacceptor. We previously showed that ptsP inactivation increases LasI-LasR quorum sensing, a system by which P. aeruginosa regulates genes in response to population density. LasI synthesizes a diffusible autoinducer that binds and activates the LasR receptor, which activates a feedback loop by increasing lasI expression. In this study, we examined the impact of the PTSNtr on quorum sensing. Disruption of ptsP increased the expression of some, but not all, tested quorum-controlled genes, including lasI, phzM (pyocyanin biosynthesis), hcnA (hydrogen cyanide biosynthesis), and, to a lesser extent, rsaL (quorum sensing regulator). Expression of these genes remained dependent on LasR and the autoinducer, whether provided endogenously or exogenously. Increased lasI expression in {Delta}ptsP (or {Delta}ptsO) cells was partly due to the presence of unphosphorylated PtsN, which alone was sufficient to elevate lasI expression. However, we observed residual increases in {Delta}ptsP or {Delta}ptsO cells even in the absence of PtsN, suggesting that PtsP and PtsO can regulate gene expression independent of PtsN. Indeed, genetically disrupting the PtsO phosphorylation site impacted gene expression in the absence of PtsN, and transcriptomic evidence suggested that PtsO and PtsN have distinct regulons. Our results expand our view of how the PTSNtr components function both within and apart from the classic phosphorylation cascade to regulate key virulence behaviors in P. aeruginosa.

IMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa often causes severe and difficult-to-treat infections. P. aeruginosa virulence requires the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system (PTSNtr), which comprises the phosphocarrier proteins PtsP and PtsO and the final phosphoacceptor, PtsN. The PTSNtr is known to modulate quorum sensing, but little is known about the mechanism of regulation. Here, we examined quorum sensing regulation by the PTSNtr. We showed that the PTSNtr increases quorum sensing-mediated activation of certain genes through the additive effects of both PtsO and PtsN. We also used transcriptomics to determine the regulons of PtsO and PtsN and found that they are largely nonoverlapping. The results position PtsO and PtsN as independent effectors in the Nitro-PTS and shed new light on virulence regulation in this important pathogen.",NA,biorxiv

Neuronal activity was recorded simultaneously from over 46,000 electrodes interfaced with brain organoids, allowing for the identification of single-cell firing events and the assessment of neuronal network connectivity based on individual spikes. In midbrain organoids, administration of L-DOPA revealed both excitatory and inhibitory cellular responses, with a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of excitatory responses, suggesting enhanced network connectivity. Capitalizing on the spatial and temporal resolution of UHD-CMOS-MEAs, we introduced new endpoints for network activity: propagation velocity and propagation area. In cortical organoids, application of the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin led to increased propagation velocity, whereas the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 resulted in a broad reduction of propagation area, along with localized increases. As FPI enables direct recording of electrical potential waveforms, frequency-domain analyses were also conducted. Spontaneous activity in cortical organoids exhibited region-specific frequency distributions, with gamma-band activity displaying distinct patterns compared to other frequency bands. Additionally, in midbrain-striatal assembloids, electrophysiological activity was observed in both regions.

In absence of a natural microbiota, the hosts development can be disturbed, but how developmental programs are affected by the microbiota is still poorly understood. Removing the microbiota from Hydra, a classic model animal in developmental biology, causes drastic developmental malformations and leads to polyps that temporarily lack the ability to bud. Recolonizing non-budding germfree Hydra with bacteria reverses this budding inhibition. Single-nucleus ATAC-seq detected a unique chromatin landscape associated with the non-budding phenotype. Single-cell RNA-seq and trajectory-based differential expression analysis showed that epithelial stem cell decision making is disturbed in non-budding polyps, whereby key developmental regulators are not expressed. This process is reversible by adding back bacteria. Transcriptionally silencing of one of the genes that failed to be activated in non-budding animals, GAPR1, led to polyps that have a significantly reduced budding capacity. The results show that maintaining a species-specific microbiota may enable the animal host to maintain its developmental program.

Significance StatementAnimal developmental programs work within the context of coevolved associations with microbes. Here, we provide mechanistic evidence of the involvement of the microbiota in maintaining the pattern formation program of Hydra with the asexual formation of buds in the lower part of the body column. We demonstrate that in the absence of bacteria both the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape is changed and that key regulatory factors are not expressed, causing changes in stem cell trajectories that result in loss of budding capacity. This study provides a new perspective on the role that microbiota plays during animal development and evolution.

This sets up a feedback loop that can enable the coexistence of alternative dormancy strategies. Over longer timescales, we show that evolution of dormancy to an evolutionary stable state can drive populations to the edge of stability, where dynamics are only weakly stabilized. We briefly consider how these conclusions are likely to apply in more complex community contexts. Our results suggest that chaos and high-amplitude population cycles are highly vulnerable to invasion and subsequent stabilization by dormancy, potentially explaining their rarity.

In both cases, changes in genotype or environment can cause sharp, nonlinear phenotypic shifts, hinting at shared underlying features of development that may link dominance and plasticity.

In most species, the Dark allele is dominant, but two species--D. jambulina and D. cf. bocqueti--have been reported to have dominant Light alleles. We show that in both Dark-dominant and Light-dominant species, the color dimorphism is linked to the same locus: the POU domain motif 3 (pdm3) transcription factor. We then demonstrate that the interspecific differences in dominance relationships between pdm3 alleles are due to changes in phenotypic plasticity. In the Dark-dominant species D. rufa and D. burlai, the Dark allele is dominant across all developmental temperatures. In contrast, in both Light-dominant species, dominance is temperature-dependent, with the Light allele becoming increasingly dominant at higher temperatures. These results suggest a mechanistic connection between the evolution of dominance and phenotypic plasticity. We propose this connection may emerge from threshold-like properties of developmental systems.

Teaser textThis study reveals a direct relationship between the evolution of dominance and phenotypic plasticity in a Mendelian, female-limited color dimorphism. This trait is linked to the same transcription factor gene, pdm3, in multiple species of the Drosophila montium lineage. However in some species, the Light pdm3 allele becomes increasingly dominant at higher temperature, while in others the Dark allele is fully dominant under all conditions. Based on these results, we propose that the evolution of dominance and plasticity may be connected by threshold-like properties of developmental systems.",NA,biorxiv

Computational methods that exploit different signals of positive selection in the pattern of mutations observed in genes across tumors have been developed to this end. One such signal of positive selection is clustering of mutations in areas of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the protein above the expectation under neutrality. Methods that exploit this signal have been hindered by the paucity in proteins with experimentally solved 3D structures covering their entire sequence. Here, we present Oncodrive3D, a computational method that by exploiting AlphaFold 2 structural models extends the identification of proteins with significant mutational 3D clusters to the entire human proteome. Oncodrive3D shows sensitivity and specificity on par with state-of-the-art cancer driver gene identification methods exploiting mutational clustering, and clearly outperforms them in computational efficiency. We demonstrate, through several examples, how significant mutational 3D clusters identified by Oncodrive3D in different known or potential cancer driver genes can reveal details about the mechanism of tumorigenesis in different cancer types and in clonal hematopoiesis.",NA,biorxiv

Ostensibly, the cellular response is dependent on interactions between extracellular matrix deformations and the cell adhesome. Low-intensity vibration (LIV) induces sinusoidal mechanical accelerations that stimulate mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) anabolism despite generating minimal matrix strain. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that accelerations of less than 1g cause nuclear motions relative to the cell membrane in adherent cells, resulting in elevated stresses in the cytoskeleton that promote transcriptional activity. Coupling a piezoelectric vibration platform with real-time microscopy, we applied a 0.7g, 90Hz LIV signal that oscillates the cell with displacements of up to {+/-}11 {micro}m. Live-cell tracking revealed that the sinusoidal vibrations caused the nucleus to move {+/-}1.27 {micro}m (17% of total displacement) out of phase with the cell membrane. Disruption of the LINC complex, which mechanically couples the nucleoskeleton to the cytoskeleton, doubled the magnitude of this relative motion, indicating that the nucleo-cytoskeletal configuration plays a major role in regulating nuclear motion. Consistent with a previously reported increase in nuclear stiffness caused by LIV, machine-learning-based image segmentation of confocal micrographs showed that LIV increased both apical and basal F-actin fiber numbers, generating a denser, more branched actin network near the nucleus. Following six 20 min bouts of LIV applied to MSC, RNA sequencing identified 372 differentially expressed genes. Upregulated gene sets were linked to F-actin assembly and focal adhesion pathways. Finite element simulations showed that nuclear stresses increased by LIV up to 18% were associated with nuclei flattening and a 30-50% increase in actin-generated forces. These findings demonstrate that low-intensity accelerations, independent of matrix strain, can directly activate a response of the nucleus, leading to cytoskeletal reorganization and heightened nuclear stresses. Thus, even very small oscillatory mechanical signals can markedly influence cell outcomes, establishing a mechanosensing pathway independent of extracellular strains.",NA,biorxiv

Endogenous electric fields, generated by the disruption of the transepithelial potential across the skin, help to guide the movement of immune and skin cells toward the wound site. However, the mechanisms by which cells sense these physical cues remain largely unknown. Through a CRISPR-based screen, we identified Galvanin, a previously uncharacterized single-pass transmembrane protein that is required for human neutrophils to change their direction of migration in response to an applied electric field. Our results indicate that Galvanin rapidly relocalizes to the anodal side of a cell on exposure to an electric field, and that the net charge on its extracellular domain is necessary and sufficient to drive this relocalization. The spatial pattern of neutrophil protrusion and retraction changes immediately upon Galvanin relocalization, suggesting that it acts as a direct sensor of the electric field that then transduces spatial information about a cells electrical environment to the migratory apparatus. The apparent mechanism of cell steering by sensor relocalization represents a new paradigm for directed cell migration.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we use lipid nanoparticle (LNP) systems based on clinically approved formulations for the efficient intracellular delivery of mRNAs encoding for intrabodies targeting mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), key mediators of the necrotic cell death modalities, necroptosis and pyroptosis, respectively.

We find that reducing inter-ligand spacing to [~]7.5 nm enhances T cell activation by up to eightfold compared to wider spacing ([~]22.5 nm), and that as few as six pMHC-I molecules are sufficient to elicit a robust response.

To overcome this challenge, we develop sex-specific emulators for the real-time prediction of QT interval prolongation, with separate models for each sex. Building an extensive dataset from 900 simulations allows us to show the superior sensitivity of 3D models over 0D single-cell models in detecting abnormal electrical propagation in response to drug effects as the risk level increases. The resulting emulators trained on this dataset showed high accuracy level, with an average relative error of 4% compared to simulation results. This enables global sensitivity analysis and the replication of in silico cardiac safety clinical trials with accuracy comparable to that of simulations when validated against in vivo data. With our emulators, we carry out in silico clinical trials in seconds on a standard laptop, drastically reducing computational time compared to traditional high-performance computing methods. This efficiency enables the rapid testing of drugs across multiple concentration ranges without additional computational cost. This approach directly addresses several key challenges faced by the biopharmaceutical industry: optimizing trial designs, accounting for variability in biological assays, and enabling rapid, cost-effective drug safety evaluations.

In this study, we exposed murine neonatal primary microglial cultures to external signals that mimic the in vivo stimuli caused by pathogens, injury, or toxic agents. In the presence of benzoyl ATP (bzATP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we observed a coordinated increase in the expression of interleukins and chemokines. We focused on the dynamics of the differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) that are statistically significant (DEMs) and tracked their post-activation dynamics. Monitoring miRNAs 3 and 8 hours (h) post-activation revealed robust changes in 33 and 57 DEMs, most of which were upregulated. The DEMs exhibiting the strongest temporal regulation included miR-155, miR-132, miR-3473e, miR-222, and miR-146b. Additionally, a strong downregulation of miR-3963 was attributed to the exposure to bzATP. Through their regulation of TNF and NF{kappa}B signaling pathways, the identified DEMs reflect the cellular response to inflammatory signals. We incubated the activated cells with ladostigil, a neuroprotective compound that has been shown to reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and cognitive decline. While there was no significant effect 3 h post-activation, at 8 h, a few miRNAs implicated in inflammation suppression such as miR-27a, miR-27b, and miR-23b were upregulated in a ladostigil-dependent manner.

The same phenotypic pattern has conflicting interpretations at different evolutionary scales. Macroevolutionary patterns are thought to reflect greater evolutionary potential in later-forming segments, but microevolutionary patterns are thought to reflect less evolutionary potential and greater phenotypic plasticity. We address this conflict by recalculating evolutionary potential (evolvability) from a systematic review of published mammalian molar sizes, then directly measure phenotypic plasticity from a controlled feeding experiment. Effects on lengths and widths are discordant in a way that suggests general growth pathways have a role in phenotypically plastic dental responses to nutrition. Effects on successive trait means do not necessarily increase downstream, contrary to long-standing hypotheses. We confirm prior findings of increasing non-inherited variance downstream, showing decoupling between effects on trait mean and variance. These patterns can be explained by a cascading model of tooth development compounding the effect of developmental instability as an influence separate from general environmental effects on the developing embryo.

This human propensity to coordinate movement with the rhythm of music requires multiscale temporal integration, allowing fast sensory events composing rhythmic input to be mapped onto slower internal templates such as periodic beats. Relatedly, beat perception has been shown to involve a selective enhancement of the beat periodicities in the neural response to rhythm. However, the extent to which this ability to move to the beat, and the related periodized neural representation, are shared across the senses beyond audition remains unknown. Here we addressed this question using acoustic and tactile rhythms, while recording separately the electroencephalography (EEG) responses and finger tapping to these rhythms in healthy volunteers. Consistent with previous studies, EEG responses to the acoustic rhythm featured significant enhancement of the beat, and this periodized neural representation was specifically concentrated within a low-frequency range below 15 Hz. In contrast, the same rhythm conveyed with tactile inputs elicited responses over a broader frequency range, up to 25Hz, with no significant periodization, and resulted in less stable tapping. Together, these findings indicate that low-frequency neural activity preferentially supports behavior-relevant internal representation of rhythmic input. However, this neural representation is not necessarily shared across the senses, as well as the ability to move to the beat, corroborating multimodal differences in beat perception. This low-frequency neural representation may thus reflect a process of multiscale temporal integration allowing the auditory system to go beyond mere tracking of onset timing and support higher-level internal representation and motor entrainment to rhythm.

Significance statementIntegrating the fast sensory events composing music into slower temporal units is a cornerstone of beat perception and social interaction through music. The current study shows that this ability critically relies on brain activity concentrated in a lower frequency range - below the recurrence of sensory events - in response to acoustic rhythm. In contrast, when the rhythm is conveyed through touch, brain responses comparatively exhibit higher frequency activity corresponding to the faithful tracking of each individual events of the tactile rhythm. Most importantly, these auditory-specific slow fluctuations feature a periodization of rhythmic inputs, compatible with behavior. This higher-level neural processing of rhythmic input could thus reflect internal representations of the beat that are not necessarily shared across sensory modalities, in line with the concept of auditory dominance in temporal event perception and motor entrainment to rhythm. The current study thus opens a promising avenue to gain fundamental knowledge on high-level multimodal perception and motor entrainment processes specific to humans.",NA,biorxiv

The life cycle of G. duodenalis is comprised by 2 stages: trophozoite (vegetative, ploidy: 4N) and cyst (infective, ploidy: 8-16N) and the transition from one to another requires a precise coordination as well as the support of the DNA repair machinery. While DNA homologous recombination DNA repair has recently been characterized, NER and BER are pathways that had not been explored. Most of the structure specific enzymes (SSE) participate in a variety of processes like DNA replication stress, DNA adduct repair, Holliday junction processing. In an effort to explore these kinds of enzymes in G. duodenalis, a minimalist parasite, we aimed at characterizing the Fen1 enzyme by cloning its gene to study its catalytic properties (binding and nuclease) using flap and bubble DNA substrates. Unexpectedly, we found that GdFen-1 is able to cleave bubble DNA, then to shed light on which domains of this enzyme are responsible for this activity, giardial acid block and a portion of a cap region were substituted by their human counterparts, and while acid block substitution did not affect this activity, the modification in the cap region did. The possible implications of these findings are addressed.

Contrary to the common assumption that PGCs directly develop into germline stem cells (GSCs), recent mammalian data and our zebrafish observations suggest a more complex picture. We hypothesized that individual PGCs contribute differentially to gonad development. To test this hypothesis, we developed two Cre-based lineage tracing systems and demonstrate that PGCs give rise to at least four distinct clone types in zebrafish. We observed no restriction in clone type localization along the anterior-posterior axis, suggesting these differences are PGC intrinsic or locally determined. Further examination of the ovarian reserve revealed functional evidence that some PGCs generate self-renewing GSCs, while others produce non-renewing progenitors that are depleted with successive matings. Collectively, our findings propose a revised model of vertebrate germline establishment with implications to reproductive lifespan. This model suggests that differentiation potential varies among PGCs, allowing individual PGCs to directly differentiate into multiple distinct germ cell types, including renewing GSCs and transient populations that contribute to an early wave of gametes.",NA,biorxiv

Our strategy gave 100% transmission of heterozygous (NTN1T2A-eGFP/+) embryos in which GFP localisation faithfully replicated endogenous NTN1 expression in the optic fissure and neural tube floorplate. Furthermore, all NTN1T2A-eGFP/+ embryos and hatched birds appeared phenotypically normal. We applied this resource to a pertinent developmental context - coloboma is a structural eye malformation characterised by failure of epithelial fusion during optic fissure closure (OFC) and NTN1 is specifically expressed in fusion pioneer cells at the edges of the optic fissure. We therefore optimised the isolation of GFP expressing cells from embryonic NTN1T2A-eGFP/+ eyes using spectral fluorescence cell-sorting and applied transcriptomic profiling of pioneer cells, which revealed multiple new OFC markers and novel pathways for developmental tissue fusion and coloboma.

While conventional multivariate approaches often simplify statistical assumptions and estimate one-dimensional independent sources shared across modalities, the relationships between true latent sources are likely more complex - statistical dependence may exist within and between modalities, and span one or more dimensions. Here we present Multimodal Subspace Independent Vector Analysis (MSIVA), a methodology to capture both joint and unique vector sources from multiple data modalities by defining both cross-modal and unimodal subspaces with variable dimensions. In particular, MSIVA enables flexible estimation of varying-size independent subspaces within modalities and their one-to-one linkage to corresponding sub-spaces across modalities. As we demonstrate, a main benefit of MSIVA is the ability to capture subject-level variability at the voxel level within independent subspaces, contrasting with the rigidity of traditional methods that share the same independent components across subjects. We compared MSIVA to a unimodal initialization baseline and a multimodal initialization baseline, and evaluated all three approaches with five candidate subspace structures on both synthetic and neuroimaging datasets. We show that MSIVA successfully identified the ground-truth subspace structures in multiple synthetic datasets, while the multimodal baseline failed to detect high-dimensional subspaces. We then demonstrate that MSIVA better detected the latent subspace structure in two large multimodal neuroimaging datasets including structural MRI (sMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), compared with the unimodal baseline. From subsequent subspace-specific canonical correlation analysis, brain-phenotype prediction, and voxelwise brain-age delta analysis, our findings suggest that the estimated sources from MSIVA with optimal subspace structure are strongly associated with various phenotype variables, including age, sex, schizophrenia, lifestyle factors, and cognitive functions. Further, we identified modality- and group-specific brain regions related to multiple phenotype measures such as age (e.g., cerebellum, precentral gyrus, and cingulate gyrus in sMRI; occipital lobe and superior frontal gyrus in fMRI), sex (e.g., cerebellum in sMRI, frontal lobe in fMRI, and precuneus in both sMRI and fMRI), schizophrenia (e.g., cerebellum, temporal pole, and frontal operculum cortex in sMRI; occipital pole, lingual gyrus, and precuneus in fMRI), shedding light on phenotypic and neuropsychiatric biomarkers of linked brain structure and function.",NA,biorxiv

Seed coat darkening is caused by an elevated accumulation and oxidation of proanthocyanidins (PAs). In common bean, the major color gene P encodes for a bHLH protein with its Psdallele controlling the postharvest slow darkening seed coat trait. In the present investigation, we determined that P, PvMYB3A, and PvWD9 are the essential components that form a protein complex and regulate PA biosynthesis in pinto beans. P does not bind with the PA biosynthetic gene Anthocyanin Reductase (PvANR) promoter but regulates its expression by interacting with PvMYB3A, which directly binds to the PvANR promoter. PvWD9 is an essential member of the core protein complex, which requires one or more additional plant components in order to interact with its partner proteins P and PvMYB3A and create a functioning complex. The Psd isoform affects the accumulation of PA by functioning in a similar manner to its isoform P, albeit at a lower efficiency. Understanding the regulation of PA biosynthesis in common beans helps to explain variances in seed coat color and issues associated with darkening after harvest.

HighlightColor and pattern of the common bean seed coat are important traits in bean breeding, which is determined by level of proanthocyanidins (PA). This study provides experimental evidence for the regulation of PA biosynthesis in common beans by the P-PvMYB3A-PvWD9 complex together with some yet unknown associated protein(s).

Thus, characterizing cancers ecological dynamics is crucial to understanding cancer evolution and can lead to discovering novel biomarkers to predict disease progression. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is an early-stage breast cancer characterized by abnormal epithelial cell growth confined within the milk ducts. In this study, we show that ecological habitat analysis of hypoxia and acidosis biomarkers can significantly improve prediction of DCIS upstaging. First, we developed a novel eco-evolutionary designed approach to define habitats in the tumor intraductal microenvironment based on oxygen diffusion distance. Then, we identify cancer cells with metabolic phenotypes attributed to their habitat conditions, such as the expression of CA9 indicating hypoxia responding phenotype, and LAMP2b indicating the acid adaptation. Traditionally these markers have shown limited predictive capabilities for DCIS upstaging, if any. However, when analyzed from an ecological perspective, their power to differentiate between pure DCIS and upstaged DCIS increased significantly. Second, using eco-evolutionary guided computational and digital pathology techniques, we discovered distinct niches with spatial patterns of these biomarkers and used the distribution of such niches to predict patient upstaging. The niches patterns were characterized by pattern analysis of both cellular and spatial features. With a 5-fold validation on the biopsy cohort, we trained a random forest classifier to achieve the area under curve (AUC) of 0.74. Our results affirm the importance of using eco-evolutionary-designed approaches in biomarkers discovery studies in the era of digital pathology by demonstrating the role of tumor ecological habitats and niches.",NA,biorxiv

Blocking experiments using overlapping peptide library of SRCR domain of DMBT1 showed that CQGRVEVLYRGSWGTV peptide, which contains bacteria-binding VEVLXXXXW motif, could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Author SummaryWe discovered that a protein named as DMBT1, which is found in our mucous membranes, plays a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. DMBT1 is a large glycoprotein that has previously reported linked to tumor suppression and HIV-1 infection. Our single-cell sequencing analysis revealed that DMBT1 is most abundant in the airway submucosal glands. In our study, we found that when DMBT1 is overexpressed in cells, it enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a peptide library from DMBT1, we pinpointed a specific peptide, CQGRVEVLYRGSWGTV, which can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. At high concentrations, it significantly reduces the viruss ability to replicate in hamsters. These findings suggest that DMBT1 on the cell membrane can promote SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight DMBT1 as a potential target for developing antiviral treatments.",NA,biorxiv

Specifically, we uncover how a pulse of histone deacetylase inhibition translates to changes in histone acetylation and methylation, as well as global and local genome folding. While most epigenomic and transcriptional changes are readily reversible once the perturbation is removed, genome architecture partially maintains its perturbed conformation. This is significant, as a second transient pulse of hyperacetylation induces continued gene expression deregulation at hundreds of loci. Using ultra-deep Micro-C, we associate memory of gene expression with enhancer-promoter contacts and repressive chromatin topology mediated by Polycomb.

Protoneuromast formation is initiated by Fgf signaling at the trailing zone of the migrating primordium in response to Fgfs produced by Wnt active cells in a leading zone. Progressive restriction of an initially broad Wnt signaling domain to a smaller leading zone allows new Fgf signaling-dependent protoneuromasts to form in the wake of the shrinking Wnt system. We show Sox2 and Sox3 are expressed in nascent and maturing protoneuromasts in a trailing part of the primordium in a pattern that is complementary to Wnt activity in a leading domain, where Sox1a, is expressed. Together, these SoxB1 factors help inhibit Wnt signaling to determine effective maturation of trailing protoneuromasts and the timely deposition of stable neuromasts. Using dkk1b and atoh1b to monitor initiation and subsequent maturation of protoneuromasts, respectively, we show how Wnt signaling regulates the pace of protoneuromast maturation in the migrating primordium, and how its inhibition by SoxB1 family members ensures maturation and deposition of stable neuromasts. Together, our observations define three steps in the periodic formation of neuromasts: first, polarization of Wnt activity in the primordium; second, pattern forming step that determines periodic formation of protoneuromasts in the context of polarized Wnt activity; and third, inhibition of Wnt signaling, which is essential for stabilizing nascent neuromasts formed in the earlier pattern forming stage.",NA,biorxiv

One of the most difficult problems to solve has been resolution of discrete conformational states of transmembrane ion channel proteins. An example is KV11.1 (hERG), comprising the primary cardiac repolarizing current, Ikr. hERG is a notorious drug anti-target against which all promising drugs are screened to determine potential for arrhythmia. Drug interactions with the hERG inactivated state are linked to elevated arrhythmia risk, and drugs may become trapped during channel closure. While prior studies have applied AlphaFold to predict alternative protein conformations, we show that the inclusion of carefully chosen structural templates can guide these predictions toward distinct functional states. This targeted modeling approach is validated through comparisons with experimental data, including proposed state-dependent structural features, drug interactions from molecular docking, and ion conduction properties from molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, AlphaFold not only predicts inactivation mechanisms of the hERG channel that prevent ion conduction but also uncovers novel molecular features explaining enhanced drug binding observed during inactivation, offering a deeper understanding of hERG channel function and pharmacology. Furthermore, leveraging AlphaFold-derived states enhances computational screening by significantly improving agreement with experimental drug affinities, an important advance for hERG as a key drug safety target where traditional single-state models miss critical state-dependent effects. By mapping protein residue interaction networks across closed, open, and inactivated states, we identified critical residues driving state transitions validated by prior mutagenesis studies. This innovative methodology sets a new benchmark for integrating deep learning-based protein structure prediction with experimental validation. It also offers a broadly applicable approach using AlphaFold to predict discrete protein conformations, reconcile disparate data, and uncover novel structure-function relationships, ultimately advancing drug safety screening and enabling the design of safer therapeutics.",NA,biorxiv

In viticulture and winemaking, the resulting distinct microbial biogeographic patterns influence wine characteristics - a well-established concept termed microbial terroir. Yet, due to the complexity of interactions, the specific environmental drivers shaping these microbiomes remain poorly understood.

We conducted a multi-year, large-scale survey (N = 680 samples) of Swiss vineyards (N = 95 sites), following a subset (N = 12, within 2.46 km) longitudinally over 3 years. We integrate microbiome (bacterial and fungal marker-gene sequencing), untargeted metabolomics (GC-MS and LC-MS/MS), environmental monitoring, and sensory data to disentangle abiotic factors influencing community assembly and interactions in vineyards and in wine fermentations.

Results show that topography and climate collectively structure microbial communities, yet exhibit distinct influences on soil- and plant-associated microbiomes. Berry-associated fungal communities exhibit the strongest site-specific imprint, enabling machine-learning-based prediction of even subtle microclimatic differences. Climatic factors and berry chemistry exhibit an inverse relationship, selectively favoring either Hanseniaspora sp. or Saccharomyces cerevisiae - each correlating with distinct metabolite and aroma profiles. Additionally, plant stress-response metabolites were associated with shifts in microbial composition and fermentation outcomes.

By integrating multi-omics and machine learning approaches, this study enhances our understanding of microbial biogeography and its role in winegrowing. Our findings highlight the need for further research on microbial transmission, vineyard management, and implications for wine quality, offering a foundation for a more precise, science-driven approach to terroir expression.

Graphical AbstractWe sampled a total of 95 vineyards, with longitudinal sampling of 12 over three years, controlling for cultivar while capturing variations in topography, soil properties, and microclimate. Data collected in vineyards further included berry chemistry, vineyard management, and phenology. We sequenced microbial communities in both vineyard and fermentation samples, and the wines were additionally analysed with three different untargeted metabolomics approaches. Supervised and unsupervised modeling revealed spatio-temporal variability, the influence of environmental factors on microbial communities, and their impact on wine characteristics.

The increasing availability of bioactivity data has improved compound representations to include biological effects, although bioactivity descriptors are often limited to a few well-documented molecules. To address this issue, we implemented a collection of deep neural networks able to leverage the experimentally determined bioactivity data associated to small molecules and infer the missing bioactivity signatures for any compound of interest. However, unlike static chemical descriptors, these bioactivity signatures dynamically evolve with new data and processing strategies. Here, we present a computational protocol to modify or generate novel bioactivity spaces and signatures, describing the main steps needed to leverage diverse bioactivity data with the current knowledge, as catalogued in the Chemical Checker (CC), using the predefined data curation pipeline. We illustrate the functioning of the protocol through four specific examples, including the incorporation of new compounds to an already existing bioactivity space, a change in the data pre-processing without altering the underlying experimental data, and the creation of two novel bioactivity spaces from scratch, which are completed in under 9 hours using GPU computing. Overall, this protocol offers a guideline for installing, testing and running the CC data integration approach on user-provided data, with the aim of extending the annotation presented for a limited number of small molecules to a larger chemical landscape.

Key pointsO_LIThe Chemical Checker is a large collection of processed, harmonized and integrated bioactivity signatures for over 1 million small molecules. Data are organized into 5 levels of increasing biological complexity and curation degrees: from chemical properties to clinical outcomes and from raw data representing explicit knowledge to embedded signatures inferred from observed bioactivity patterns.
C_LIO_LIThe Chemical Checker package provides a predefined and versatile framework to integrate user-provided data to the Chemical Checker universe of small molecules and generate novel customized bioactivity signatures.

Here, using computational modelling we show that LMCs experience elevated fluid shear stress that is significantly higher than that in other blood vessels during ischaemic stroke in animals and humans. We take advantage of this to selectively enhance flow in LMCs using shear-activated nanoparticle aggregates carrying the vasodilator nitroglycerin (NG-NPAs) that specifically release drug in regions of vessels with high shear stress ([&ge;]100 dyne/cm2). The NG-NPAs significantly increased LMC-mediated penumbral perfusion, decreased infarct volume, and reduced neurological deficit without altering systemic blood pressure in a rat ischaemic stroke model. The NG-NPAs also did not cause known common side effects of systemic nitrate administration, such as systemic hypotension, cerebral vascular steal, cortical vein dilation, or intracranial pressure elevation. Systemic administration of free NG at the maximal tolerated dose, which was ten times higher than the dose of NG used in the NG-NPAs, did not enhance LMC perfusion and dropped blood pressure. Thus, packaging NG within shear-activated NPAs can potentially enable this widely available vasodilator to become a highly effective therapeutic for ischaemic stroke.",NA,biorxiv

Currently there are no clinically approved vaccines or therapeutics to target infection. Nipah is an enveloped virus with two surface glycoproteins, the trimeric fusion (F) and tetrameric attachment glycoprotein (G). G is responsible for cellular attachment via binding to ephrin B2/B3. Glycosylation of Nipah G and its effects on receptor engagement has not previously been studied but is important as glycosylation impacts immunogenicity, receptor binding and structural conformations for other enveloped virus glycoproteins. Our phylogenetic and mass spectrometry analysis of site-specific N-glycans of the Nipah G Malaysia strain revealed how N-glycosylation has evolved since the appearance of the virus in 1998. We discovered that the N481 N-glycosite is not conserved and although the glycan does not directly contribute to receptor binding, the threonine/serine in the glycosylation sequon is critical for maintaining long-range stability of individual G subunits that facilitates ephrin B2 binding affinity. Together, these data reveal plasticity of N-glycosylation sites across Nipah species and the presence of hydrogen bonding networks that contribute to G stability and host engagement, which is valuable information for understanding virus attachment/entry mechanisms as well as the rationale design of structure-based vaccines.

ACE inhibition is a frontline, FDA-approved, therapy for cardiovascular diseases yet is associated with significant side effects, including higher rates of lung cancer. To date, structural studies have been confined to individual domains or partially denatured cryo-EM structures. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the glycosylated full sACE dimer. We resolved four structural states at 2.99 to 3.65 [A] resolution which are primarily differentiated by varying degrees of solvent accessibility to the active sites and reveal the full dimerization interface. We also employed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and heterogeneity analysis in cryoSPARC, cryoDRGN, and RECOVAR to elucidate the conformational dynamics of sACE and identify key regions mediating conformational change.

We developed a probabilistic approach for inferring clonal phylogeny from single-cell and matched whole-exome data. Distantly related genetic clones in the peritoneum express the lipid metabolism program, likely due to signaling by the adipocyte-rich peritoneum environment, and cells in most clones express multiple programs, suggesting that transcriptomic plasticity is a prevalent feature of metastatic cells.

Thus, unique insights into growth dynamics can be obtained without much need of a calculus background.

Using spatial multi-omics, in vivo functional assays, and systems-level analysis, we delineate the diverse metabolic and immune architecture of GBM. We identify a lipid-dependent lineage of treatment-resistant persister cells (TRPCs) that engage tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in a spatially organized, metabolically specialized crosstalk. TRPCs co-opt CCR2, CSF1R, CD163+ TAMs for lipid scavenging and acquisition, promoting a pro-tumorigenic and immunosuppressive microenvironment. This cooperative axis is critically dependent on lipid chaperones like FABPs, whose targeting disrupts TAM recruitment, remodels immune composition, and suppresses tumor growth. Retrospective clinical analyses reveal that elevated TRPC-associated transcriptome may serve as stratification criteria to identify patients benefiting from lipid-lowering therapies like statins. Our findings uncover a targetable immunometabolic circuit between TRPCs and TAMs and support the development of precision therapies that disrupt lipid-fueled tumor-immune cooperation in GBM.

In briefTreatment-resistant persister cells (TRPCs) in glioblastoma spatially engage TAMs to facilitate lipid transfer, thereby sustaining tumor growth and promoting immune evasion. Targeting this TRPC-TAM metabolic axis reprograms the immunosuppressive microenvironment and improves therapeutic outcomes, revealing a clinically actionable metabolic vulnerability with potential for precision immune-metabolic interventions in GBM.

Commercial hydrogels like Matrigel that simulate basement membrane are ill-defined, dilute, variable and contain murine proteins.

To obtain a holistic understanding of cell state, computational methods are needed that carefully integrate the different views to capture shared information as well as tease apart modality-specific information. We present a computational framework that automatically learns partial information sharing between multiple modalities by using an Autoencoder with a Partially Overlapping Latent space learned through Latent Optimization (APOLLO). On paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data (SHARE-seq) and paired scRNA-seq and surface protein data (CITE-seq), we demonstrate that APOLLO comprehensively and automatically identifies and distinguishes between information captured by both modalities, in the shared latent space, and modality-specific information. Beyond sequencing modalities, large-scale multiplexed single-cell imaging datasets, such as the Human Protein Atlas, are becoming available that allow studying how protein localization relates to function. While chromatin, microtubules or ER are standardly stained as a reference, little is known about the information shared between these stains. We found that APOLLO enables the prediction of missing modalities, such as unmeasured protein stains, and allows disentangling which modality or cellular compartment is linked with a specific phenotype, such as the variability in protein localization observed across single cells. Collectively, APOLLO enables explicit learning of shared and modality-specific information leading to a more holistic understanding of cell state and the underlying regulatory mechanisms. APOLLO is a general framework that can be applied to any multi-modal data well beyond the single-cell domain including, for example, large-scale medical biobanks.",NA,biorxiv

We introduce scTransient, a trajectory-inference pipeline integrated into our cloud-based single-cell analysis platform PSCS. scTransient transforms single-cell expression profiles into continuous pseudotime signals and couples them with wavelet-based signal processing to isolate short-lived but biologically meaningful bursts of activity. After ordering cells with unsupervised graph trajectories or supervised psupertime, scTransient windows expression values along pseudotime, applies a continuous wavelet transform, and assigns every gene a Transient-Event Score (TES) that rewards sharp, isolated coefficients while penalizing background fluctuations. Synthetic benchmarks show TES robustly recovers transient events across a wide range of cell numbers, signal-to-noise ratios, and event widths. Applying scTransient to three public datasets-- hematopoietic differentiation, monocyte-to-macrophage maturation, and single-cell proteomic cell-cycle progression--uncovers previously unreported, process-specific expression spikes. These include erythropoiesis regulators (e.g., Nfe2), membrane-raft remodeling proteins during macrophage differentiation, and S-phase DNA-replication factors in A549 cells. Functional enrichment confirms that top-scoring genes cluster into pathways directly pertinent to each transition.

Plexins stand out because they can directly bind with both Rho- and Ras-family small GTPases through their intracellular domains when these GTPases are in their active, GTP-bound states. This binding occurs via intracellular regions which include a Rho-GTPase Binding Domain (RBD) and a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) segment. Studies have shown that Rho and Ras GTPases play vital roles in plexin signaling and activation. However, the structural dynamics of plexins and GTPases and how these conformational changes affect interactions when plexin is bound with both Ras and Rho-GTPases or bound to only one specific GTPase has remained unclear.

In this study, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on six distinct plexin-GTPase bound systems to investigate the differences in conformations and dynamics between Plexin-B1 and three GTPases: Rap1b, Rnd1, and Rac1. Our analysis revealed that dynamics with Rac1 are more altered, compared to Rnd1 depending on whether plexins GAP domain is bound or unbound to Rap1b. In addition, we further investigated alterations in network centralities and compared the network dynamics of the Plexin-GTPases complexes, focusing on the differences when Plexin is bound to both Ras (Rap1b) and Rho-GTPases (Rnd1/Rac1) versus when it is bound to only one GTPase. Our study revealed that Rnd1 exhibits stronger and more stable interactions with Plexin-B1 in the absence of Rap1b, while Rac1 shows fewer and less stable connections in comparison. These computational models have features that broadly agree with experimental results from hydrogen-deuterium exchange detected by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). Such insights provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Plexin-GTPase interactions and the complexities of signaling mechanisms involving GTPases in general.",NA,biorxiv

One prominent example is that CNNs trained on ImageNet exhibit an image texture bias, while humans exhibit a strong bias toward object shape. Although CNN shape bias can be increased in various ways, e.g., using data augmentation or additional training techniques, it remains unclear what causes the strong discrepancy between human and CNN object recognition strategies. Developmental research suggests that one factor driving human shape bias is that during early childhood, toddlers tend to fill their field-of-view with close-up objects. Here, we operationalize this close-up as a zoom-in on objects during CNN training which we show increases shape bias without any additional training or data augmentation. We provide further evidence for the advantage of closeup object vision by systematically manipulating the background-object ratio during CNN training, and demonstrate a strong (inverse) correlation with shape bias. Moreover, zooming-in on objects, thereby more closely emulating child vision, not only increases shape bias but also concurrently aligns classification accuracy and shape bias between humans and CNNs. Finally, we achieve a near human-like shape bias when using a developmentally-inspired background-object ratio for training and shape bias assessment. In sum, from a simple adjustment to common image datasets - zooming-in on objects - human-like shape bias can emerge. These results suggest that taking inspiration from human learning strategies is a promising avenue for building human-aligned, efficient, and more robust vision CNNs.",NA,biorxiv

Airspace monocytes, precursors of the differentiated AM, are found in increased numbers in the lungs of smokers yet little is known about their metabolic regulation and function. Here, we develop a click chemistry-based single cell analysis platform to characterise human airspace monocytes and AM ex vivo, identifying distinct metabolic profiles and a key role for oxidative phosphorylation in supporting phagocytic function. While blood and newly recruited CD93+ airspace monocytes show low mitochondrial dependency, AM rely heavily on oxidative phosphorylation. Acute succinate supplementation enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and phagocytosis in monocytes and promoted their differentiation into highly oxidative macrophages with enhanced function. Succinate emerges as a promising candidate to restore lung immune function, particularly in the smokers lung where airspace monocytes are enriched. Overall, we identify mitochondrial metabolism as a key modulator of lung immune function and a target for therapeutic intervention, with potential applications in systemic monocyte-targeted therapies and metabolic preconditioning for adoptive cell therapies.

The multifunctional ability of AoDHP is presently a rare observation, and there exists a limitation for how novel dehaloperoxidases can be identified from macrobenthic infauna. In order to discover more infaunal DHP-bearing candidates, we have devised a facilitated method for an accurate taxonomic identification that places visual and molecular taxonomic approaches in parallel. Traditional visual taxonomic species identification by the non-specialist, at least for A. ornata, or even for other marine worms, is a very difficult and time-consuming task since a large diversity is present and the method is restricted to adult worm specimens. The work herein aimed to describe a method that particularly simplifies the taxonomic identification of A. ornata through the assessment of its mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene by employing the DNA barcoding technique. Furthermore, whole worm specimens of A. ornata were used to extract and purify AoDHP followed by an H2O2-dependent peroxidase activity assay evaluation against substrate 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. AoDHP isoenzyme A was also overexpressed as the recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, and its peroxidase activity parameters were compared to AoDHP from the natural source. The activity assay assessment indicated a tight correlation for all Michaelis-Menten parameters evaluated. We conclude that the method described herein exhibits a streamlined approach to identify the polychaete A. ornata, which can be adopted by the non-specialist, and the full procedure is predicted to facilitate the discovery of novel dehaloperoxidases from other marine invertebrates.",NA,biorxiv

It comprises several members, among which IFN-2 and IFN-{beta} are the most extensively studied, with important antiviral and immune-modulatory functions. Recent findings linking autoantibodies against type-I interferons to severe COVID-19 suggest a potential role for IFN-{omega} in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, little is known about human IFN-{omega}, as most research on this interferon has been conducted in feline models. Here, we demonstrate that human IFN-{omega} is secreted at levels comparable to those of IFN-2 or IFN-{beta} upon stimulation with inflammatory agonists and triggers a robust antiviral response, inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Moreover, IFN-{omega} enhances the effector functions of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells primed de novo from healthy donor cells, highlighting its capacity to promote strong cellular immunity. Our results position IFN-{omega} as a key member of the type-I interferon family, with promising potential for therapeutic and vaccine applications.

Author SummaryType-I interferons are pleiotropic cytokines, including IFN- and IFN-{beta}, which are well known for their antiviral activities. Here, we report on the functional characteristics of human IFN-{omega}, a neglected member of the type-I IFN family, which has primarily been studied in feline models. We show here that human IFN-{omega} induces intense downstream signaling in cells resulting in the upregulation of antiviral genes, and efficient restriction of SARS-CoV-2 replication. IFN-{omega} also promotes the acquisition of strong cytolytic functions by antigen primed CD8+ T cells. Overall, our findings portray human IFN-{omega} as a major antiviral molecule, similar to the well-studied and highly effective IFN-2. The secretion of IFN-{omega} upon infection is likely to be crucial for effective control of multiple viruses, advocating for its use in therapeutic approaches in humans.",NA,biorxiv

However, the optimal condition of brain function to study between-person differences in cognition remains unclear. Additionally, there is a lack of objective biomarkers to accurately predict cognitive function, with brain age emerging as a potential candidate. Recent research suggests that brain age offers minimal additional information on cognitive decline beyond what chronological age provides, prompting a shift toward approaches focused directly on cognitive prediction. Using a novel deep learning approach, we evaluated the predictive power of the functional connectome during various states (resting state, movie-watching, and n-back) on episodic memory and working memory performance. Our findings show that while task-based connectomes, especially during movie watching, better predict working memory, resting state connectomes are equally effective in predicting episodic memory. Furthermore, individuals with a negative brain-cognition gap (where brain predictions underestimate actual performance) exhibited lower physical activity, lower education, and higher cardiovascular risk compared to those with a positive gap. This shows that knowledge of the brain-cognition gap provides insights into factors contributing to cognitive resilience. Further lower PET-derived measures of dopamine binding were linked to a greater brain-cognition gap, mediated by regional functional variability. Together, our study introduces the brain-cognitive gap, as a new marker, modulated by the dopamine system, to identify individuals at risk of compromised brain function.",NA,biorxiv

Integration of these techniques would be groundbreaking for the study of alcohol use disorder (AUD). AUD is rooted in significant neural adaptations that could be functionally monitored and manipulated at the single-cell level across development of dependence in rodents. However, 2P imaging and related methodologies often require or are facilitated by head-fixation, and a lack of head-fixed models have hindered their integration for the study of alcohol dependence.

MethodsWe developed a head-fixed model in which animals learned to self-administer ethanol across [~]14 days. Active lever responding resulted in a tone cue and ethanol reward, whereas responding on the inactive lever resulted in neither cue nor ethanol reward. Following acquisition, animals extinguished lever pressing across a minimum of 10 days. And finally, animals were tested separately for both cue- and ethanol-induced reinstatement of lever pressing.

ResultsHere we show, for the first time, that in our head-fixed ethanol self-administration model male and female mice reliably pressed an active, but not inactive, lever for an oral ethanol reward. Ethanol rewards positively correlated with blood ethanol concentrations, at pharmacologically relevant levels. Furthermore, mice extinguished ethanol self-administration when the ethanol reward and cue were omitted, suggesting active lever pressing was ethanol directed. Following extinction, presentation of the ethanol-associated cue or priming with ethanol itself invigorated reinstatement of ethanol seeking, modeling relapse in a manner that replicates decades of work in freely-moving rodent studies.

ConclusionsOverall, our head-fixed ethanol self-administration model will allow for incorporation of novel technologies that require or are greatly facilitated by head-fixation, improving our ability to study and understand the neural adaptations and computations that underlie alcohol dependence.",NA,biorxiv

While plants actively synthesize ascorbate during the day, its degradation becomes prominent under prolonged dark conditions. Since ascorbate degradation begins with its oxidized form, dehydroascorbate (DHA), this process inherently requires ascorbate oxidation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying dark-induced ascorbate oxidation and subsequent degradation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of intracellular and extracellular ascorbate redox regulation in controlling this process. Using Arabidopsis knockout mutants for key enzymes involved in ascorbate oxidation and recycling, including ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and ascorbate oxidase (AO), as well as NADPH oxidases (rbohD and rbohF), we found that none of these enzymes significantly influenced the dark-induced decrease in ascorbate levels. Notably, ascorbate levels decreased similarly in newly generated multiple mutants, including a quintuple mutant ({Delta}dhar pad2 mdar5), which has severely impaired ascorbate recycling capacity, and the ao2 rbohD double mutant, which is strongly expected to exhibit a highly altered apoplastic redox state. Furthermore, we examined the potential involvement of senescence signaling, including ORESARA1 and ethylene signaling components, but found no evidence for their contribution. These findings indicate that the dark-induced decrease in ascorbate levels is not governed by conventional pathways for ascorbate oxidation and recycling or senescence signaling processes, suggesting an unidentified regulatory mechanism.",NA,biorxiv

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) on testicular tissues from patients with obstructive azoospermia(OA) and NOA. HE staining confirmed the structural abnormalities of the seminiferous tubules in NOA patients. We identified 12 germ cell subtypes (spermatogonial stem cell-0 (SSC0), SSC1, SSC2, diffing-spermatogonia (Diffing-SPG), diffed-spermatogonia (Diffed-SPG), pre-leptotene (Pre-Lep), leptotene-zygotene (L-Z), pachytene (Pa), diplotene (Di), spermatids-1 (SPT1), SPT2, and SPT3) and 8 Sertoli cell subtypes (SC1-SC8). Among them, three novel Sertoli cell subtypes phenotypes were identified, namely SC4/immature, SC7/mature, and SC8/further mature Sertoli cells. For each germ or Sertoli cell subtype, we identified unique new markers, among which immunofluorescence confirmed co-localization of ST3GAL4, A2M, ASB9, and TEX19 and DDX4 (classical marker of germ cell). PRAP1, BST2, and CCDC62 were co-expressed with SOX9 (classical marker of Sertoli cell) in testes tissues also confirmed by immunofluorescence. The interaction between germ cell subtypes and Sertoli cell subtypes exhibits stage-specific-matching pattern, as evidenced by SC1/2/5/7 involving in SSC0-2 development, SC3 participating in the whole process of spermiogenesis, SC4/6 participating in Diffing and Diffed-SPG development, and SC8 involving in the final stage of SPT3. This pattern of specific interactions between subtypes of germ cell and Sertoli cell was confirmed by immunofluorescence of novel markers in testes tissues. The interaction was mainly contributed by Notch1/2/3 signaling. Our study profiled the single-cell transcriptome of human spermatogenesis and provided many potentials molecular markers for developing testicular puncture specific marker kits for NOA patients.

In this paper we employ bond graph approaches to develop models of SLC transporters that conserve mass, charge and energy, respectively, and which can be parameterised for a specific cell and tissue type for which the experimental kinetic data is available. We show how analytic expressions that preserve thermodynamic consistency can be derived for a representative four- or six-state model, given reasonable assumptions associated with steady-state flux conditions. We present details on fitting parameters for SLC2A2 (a GLUT transporter) and SLC5A1 (an SGLT transporter) to experimental data and show how well the steady-state flux expressions match the full kinetic analysis. Since the bond graph approach will not be familiar to many readers, we provide a detailed description of the approach and illustrate its application to a number of familiar biophysical processes.

SIGNIFICANCEPhysiological systems typically involve coupled mechanical, electrical and chemical processes, with energy acting as a universal currency across these domains. We propose a new visual representation for all components of these processes using bond graphs. Bringing all physical processes under one consistent framework greatly simplifies the task of understanding multiscale physiological processes. This energy-based framework, which is the 0D version of a more general 3D port-Hamiltonian theory, can be used to model all lumped parameter physiological processes. A small number of bond graph templates can be used to model all members of the large SLC transporter family, and reduced thermodynamically consistent steady-state flux models provide a useful simplification for many situations. Glucose transport is chosen here to illustrate the bond graph approach because it represents the first step in cell metabolic processes, where energy conservation needs to be a fundamental characteristic of quantitative models. Our future work on cell metabolism will build on the foundation established here.",NA,biorxiv

Conversely, the least complex systems are ""green biofilms"" with a completely unexplored mycobiome. We describe here a new system intermediate between green biofilms and lichens - semilichens.
- Light and fluorescence microscopy, eDNA sequencing, molecular phylogeny, Chlorophyll a fluorescence and 13C labelling/metabolomics were used to study algal and fungal identity, morphology and physiology of the symbiosis.
- Tight contact between algae and a single predominant fungus (mycobiont) is revealed in semilichens. The algae are from the symbiotic lineages of Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvophyceae, the fungi belong to Arthoniomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Lecanoromycetes and Lichinomycetes. Algae are alive and perform substantial photosynthetic activity. 13C labelled photosynthates are partially converted into specific fungal polyols (arabitol, mannitol) demonstrating the C-flow from algae to fungi.
- The new symbiotic system was defined and compared with other terrestrial algal-fungal symbioses. It is characterized by minimalist environmental requirements and extremely low production of biomass. As a result, it also inhabits environments unfavourable for lichens.

Neurotrophic Factor-1/carboxypeptidase E (NF-1/CPE) gene therapy has been shown to prevent and reverse memory loss and pathology AD mouse models However, the mechanisms of action of NF-1/CPE are not fully understood. We investigated if a non-enzymatic form of NF-1/CPE-E342Q is efficient in reversing AD pathology and carried out a proteomic study to uncover the mechanisms of action of NF-1/CPE in AD mice.

MethodsAAV-human NF-1/CPE and a non-enzymatic form, NF-1/CPE -E342Q were delivered into hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice and effects on cognitive function, neurodegeneration, synaptogenesis and autophagy were investigated. A quantitative proteomic analysis of hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice with and without AAV-NF-1/CPE treatment was carried out.

ResultsHippocampal delivery of AAV-NF-1/CPE-E342Q prevented memory loss, neurodegeneration and increase in activated microglia in 3xTg-AD mice, indicating its action is independent of its enzymatic activity. Quantitative proteomic analysis of hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice that underwent NF-1/CPE gene therapy revealed differential expression of >2000 proteins involving many metabolic pathways. Of these, two new proteins down-regulated by NF-1/CPE: Nexin4 (SNX4) and Trim28 which increase A{beta} production and tau levels, respectively were identified. Western blot analysis verified that they were reduced in AAV-NF-1/CPE treated 3xTg-AD mice compared to untreated mice. Our proteomic analysis indicated synaptic organization as top signaling pathway altered as a response to CPE expression. Synaptic markers PSD95 and Synapsin1 were decreased in 3xTg-AD mice and were restored with AAV-NF-1/CPE treatment. Proteomic analysis hypothesized involvement of autophagic signaling pathway. Indeed, multiple proteins known to be markers of autophagy were down-regulated in 3xTg-AD mice, accounting for impaired autophagy. Expression of these proteins were upregulated in 3xTg-AD mice with NF-1/CPE gene therapy, thereby reversing autophagic impairment.

ConclusionsThis study uncovered vast actions of NF-1/CPE in restoring expression of networks of critical proteins including those necessary for maintaining neuronal survival, synaptogenesis and autophagy, while down-regulating many proteins that promote tau and A{beta} accumulation to reverse memory loss and AD pathology in 3xTg-AD mice. AAV-NF-1/CPE gene therapy uniquely targets many metabolic levels, offering a promising holistic approach for AD treatment.

In a northern Baltic Sea one-month mesocosm experiment, we therefore exposed a coastal microbial community to temperature and nutrient regimes representative of winter and early summer (i.e., 1{degrees}C and 10{degrees}C, with and without DOM additions) in a 2x2 factorial design. Midway through the experiment, specific growth rates were highest for the 10{degrees}C plus DOM treatment (TN; [~]2.5 day-1), comparable for the 1{degrees}C plus DOM (N) and the 10{degrees}C (T) treatments at [~]1.0 day-1; and low for the control (1{degrees}C, no DOM enrichment [C]; 0.2 day-1). Taxonomic analysis of metatranscriptomes uncovered broad treatment specific responses, and a PERMANOVA on the 182,618 transcribed genes revealed statistically significant effects of both temperature and DOM, and significant interaction effects between the two (altogether involving 18% of genes). Significant differences in transcription identified by EdgeR analysis included Nitrosopumilus genes for ammonium uptake and ammonia oxidation in the 1{degrees}C mesocosms (C, N), membrane transporters for small organic acids in the N-treatment, genes for nitrogen and phosphorus assimilation along with molecular chaperones in the T-treatment, and dominance of Oceanospirillales genes for energy and growth metabolism in the TN-treatment. These metatranscriptomic responses were associated with changes in e.g. prokaryotic growth rates and growth efficiency, providing clues to how successional changes in community composition and metabolism are directed by temperature and DOM as central factors underlying environmental change.

ImportanceIt is recognized that increases in temperature and dissolved organic matter loading are key to understanding how climate change will influence polar ecosystems. Still, little is known of the effects of these factors on the physiological responses of Arctic prokaryotes. Since prokaryotes are principal drivers of biogeochemical cycles, we investigated how temperature and dissolved organic matter influence prokaryotic transcriptional responses in taxonomy and metabolic pathways. The metatranscriptomics analyses uncovered broad treatment specific responses linked with changes in prokaryotic community composition, growth rates, and growth efficiency. Yet, and importantly, the expression of most metabolic functions remained stable, suggesting a pronounced functional resilience of the prokaryotic community enabled by shifts in the dominance of different taxa. This emphasizes the large potential and importance of identifying the metabolic functions that underlie the divergence of prokaryotic communities in response to environmental changes projected to alter some of the most vulnerable marine environments.",NA,biorxiv

However, the high sparsity, noise, and dropout events inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant challenges for accurate and reliable GRN inference. The rapid growth in experimentally validated transcription factor-DNA binding data (e.g., ChIP-seq) has enabled supervised machine learning methods, which rely on known gene regulatory interactions to learn patterns, and achieve high accuracy in GRN inference by framing it as a gene regulatory link prediction task. This study addresses the gene regulatory link prediction problem by learning informative vectorized representations at the gene level to predict missing regulatory interactions. However, a higher performance of supervised learning methods requires a large amount of known TF-DNA binding data, which is often experimentally expensive and therefore limited in amount. Advances in large-scale pre-training and transfer learning provide a transformative opportunity to address this challenge. In this study, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models, trained on extensive scRNA-seq datasets and known as single-cell foundation models (scFMs). These models are combined with joint graph-based learning to establish a robust foundation for gene regulatory link prediction.

ResultsWe propose scRegNet, a novel and effective framework that leverages scFMs with joint graph-based learning for gene regulatory link prediction. scRegNet achieves state-of-the-art results in comparison with nine baseline methods on seven scRNA-seq benchmark datasets. In addition, scRegNet is more robust than the baseline methods on noisy training data.

Sleep and pregnancy have been studied in many models, but most focus heavily on mammals. However, pregnancy is ubiquitous across the animal kingdom - a hallmark of convergent evolution; similarly sleep is a shared feature across diverse species. Here, we present an ideal model in which to study the dynamics between sleep and pregnancy in invertebrates. The Pacific beetle mimic cockroach, Diploptera punctata, is a viviparous cockroach species that uses milk proteins to nourish its young with a broodsac over a three month pregnancy. However, little is known about the relationship between this unique reproductive biology and daily rhythms of activity and sleep. We established that D. punctata displayed a peak in activity shortly following sunset, with males significantly more active than females. When scavenging behavior was examined, males and non-pregnant females emerged more often and traveled further from a shelter compared to pregnant females, suggesting reduced risk-taking behavior in late pregnancy. Chronic disturbance of sleep during pregnancy negatively impacted embryo development by increasing gestational duration and decreasing the transcription of milk proteins. These findings indicate that sleep is key to embryo development and that pregnancy has a significant impact on the daily rhythms of activity in Diploptera punctata. More broadly, we present a tractable invertebrate model for understanding the relationship between sleep and pregnancy, which will aid in the exploration of the poorly understood interface between these two ubiquitous and highly conserved traits.",NA,biorxiv

While fractionated radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy and immune involvement is clinically effective, its outcomes vary due to tumor heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment-induced resistance. This study develops a biologically grounded, lattice-based, agent-based model (ABM) of Stage III sigmoid colon cancer. The model simulates tumor cell proliferation, immune-tumor interactions, ATP-dependent metabolism, and oxygen diffusion via reaction-diffusion approximations. Tumor response to fractionated radiotherapy is governed by the Linear-Quadratic (LQ) model, with chemotherapy modeled as a radiosensitizer. Immune dynamics are represented both spatially and through a coupled ODE system. Simulations reveal progressive tumor volume reduction across radiotherapy fractions, emergence of resistant subclones in hypoxic zones, and variable immune infiltration based on comorbid factors. ATP levels regulate proliferation thresholds, while TCP/NTCP curves demonstrate dose-response windows. Survival fractions differ significantly between sensitive and resistant populations. This integrated ABM effectively captures the spatiotemporal evolution of CRC under radiotherapy and immune pressure. It provides a clinically meaningful platform to explore treatment outcomes, assess tumor control probabilities, and serve as a computational foundation for personalized therapy planning in colorectal cancer.",NA,biorxiv

While traditional computational models often rely on Boolean logic to describe immune decision-making, these binary representations oversimplify the nuanced, reversible and gradated nature of actual immune responses. To address this limitation, we present a multi-valued logic framework that models T cell activation using three discrete levels--low, intermediate, and high--for each regulatory input. Focusing on cytokine production as a functional readout, our model uses threshold-based logic rules to compute output levels based on combinations of TCR, co-stimulatory and inhibitory signals. We analyzed the system through both deterministic state-space exploration and stochastic asynchronous simulations, capturing both static outcomes and dynamic trajectories. Results reveal that cytokine output scales proportionally with activating inputs, while inhibitory signals modulate these responses in a graded, context-sensitive manner. The model avoids bi-stability or irreversible attractors, instead reflecting the flexible and reversible behavior observed in biological systems. Comparative analysis with experimental data from literature supports key assumptions of the model, including dose-dependent cytokine production and the enhancing effect of co-stimulation. In contrast to purely Boolean or continuous models, our multi-valued approach strikes a balance between interpretability and computational efficiency. It provides a flexible and tractable framework for representing immune logic and is well-suited for integration into larger, systems-level models of immune function.",NA,biorxiv

Glial cells such as astrocytes and microglia are known to respond to mechanical forces like fluid shear stress but the impact of this stress on their functionality and any subsequent impact on neurons remains poorly defined. To investigate how pathologically high fluid shear stress modulates astrocyte and microglia function and to determine whether glial responses to fluid shear influence neuronal survival and morphology, we applied low pathological levels of fluid shear stress (0.1 dynes/cm2) to cultured human astrocytes and microglia and assessed functional changes including metabolic activity, metabolite release, lipid droplet accumulation, and phagocytic activity. Conditioned media from these glia were then applied to differentiated SH-SY5Y neurons to evaluate effects on cell survival and neurite outgrowth. We then focused on identifying the soluble factor mediating the observed neurotoxicity. We found that fluid shear stress promotes distinct functional responses in astrocytes and microglia, including increased metabolic activity in astrocytes, increased lipid droplet accumulation in microglia, and heightened release of extracellular ATP in both cell types. Exposure to shear-conditioned glial media significantly reduced neuronal survival and neurite length. This neurotoxic effect was abolished by activated charcoal filtration but not by boiling and was prevented through P2x7 receptor inhibition in neurons, suggesting extracellular ATP as a causative agent. These findings indicate that high fluid shear stress promotes glial-mediated neurotoxicity via purinergic signaling. This study helps to characterize glial-neuronal mechanobiological interaction in the context of neuropathology and provides support for targeting purinergic signaling pathways as a therapeutic approach for neuropathologies associated with altered interstitial fluid flow.

Statement of significanceGlial cells, until recently merely considered to support neurons, are now known to play critical roles in neural tissue development and function. Astrocytes and microglia play diverse roles in the central nervous system, adopting phenotypes that both promote and resolve pathology. Within brain tissue, disruptions to interstitial fluid flow are associated with brain injury, ischemic stroke, and glioma. This study identifies fluid shear stress as a modulator of glial cell function with downstream neurotoxic consequences. Namely, we found that increased release of extracellular ATP by glial cells under high shear promotes neurotoxicity via P2x7 receptor signaling. These findings help to characterize mechanobiological glial-neuronal communication and lend support for the therapeutic efficacy of P2x7 receptor inhibition in the treatment of neuropathology.",NA,biorxiv

However, it still needs to be explored whether the same concept applies to preclinical, i.e. animal models of stroke recovery. To address this question, we investigated behavioral data from 125 adult male C57Bl/6J mice with photothrombotic strokes in the sensorimotor cortex. Lesion size and location were determined in the first week using in vivo T2-weighted MRI. Motor recovery was evaluated repeatedly over four weeks using the cylinder, grid walk, and rotating beam test. Recovery trajectories were analyzed using a newly formulated Mouse Recovery Rule (MRR), comparing it against the traditional PRR. Initial findings indicated variable recovery patterns, which were separated using a stepwise linear regression approach resulting in two clusters: 47% PRR and 53% MRR. No significant correlation was found between recovery patterns and lesion size or location, suggesting that other biological factors drive individual differences in recovery. Of note, in the MRR cluster, animals recovered to 90% of their initial behavioral state within the first four weeks post-stroke, which is higher than the 70% recovery usually reported in human PRR studies. This study demonstrates the complexity of translating the PRR to stroke recovery models in mice and underscores the need for species-specific recovery models.

Early exposure to microbes can have lasting influences on the assembly and functionality of the hosts microbiota, leaving a life-long imprint on host health and disease. Studies of the role played by parental care in microbial acquisition have primarily focused on humans and hosts with agricultural relevance. Anuran vertebrates offer the opportunity to examine microbial community composition across life stages as a function of parental investment. In this study, we investigate vertical transmission of microbiota during parental care in a poison frog (Family Dendrobatidae), where fathers transport their offspring piggyback-style from terrestrial clutches to aquatic nurseries. We found that substantial bacterial colonization of the embryo begins after hatching from the vitelline envelope, emphasizing its potential role as microbial barrier during early development. Using a laboratory cross-foster experiment, we demonstrated that poison frogs performing tadpole transport serve as a source of skin microbes for tadpoles on their back. To study how transport impacts the microbial skin communities of tadpoles in an ecologically relevant setting, we sampled frogs and tadpoles of sympatric species that do or do not exhibit tadpole transport in their natural habitat. We found more diverse microbial communities associated with tadpoles of transporting species compared to a non-transporting frog. However, we detected no difference in the degree of similarity between adult and tadpole skin microbiotas, based on whether the frog species exhibits transporting behavior or not. Using a field experiment, we confirmed that tadpole transport can result in the persistent colonization of tadpoles by isolated microbial taxa associated with the caregivers skin, albeit often at low prevalence. This is the first study to describe vertical transmission of skin microbes in anuran amphibians, showing that offspring transport may serve as a mechanism for transmission of parental skin microbes. Overall, these findings provide a foundation for further research on how vertical transmission in this order impacts host-associated microbiota and physiology.",NA,biorxiv

Extant eukaryotes share several classes of highly conserved lipid transfer proteins (LTP) that associate with donor membranes, bind individual lipid molecules, and shuttle them to acceptor membranes. Because cells lacking organelles do not require extensive lipid transport networks, it is not known if this machinery pre-dated eukaryotic organelles or had to evolve alongside them. Here we describe a class of putative lipid transporters in the Asgard archaeota superphylum that share a common ancestry with eukaryotic LTPs in the START domain superfamily. We identified three classes of Asgard START proteins, StarAsg1-3, which are conserved across most Asgard phyla. Of these, StarAsg1 family proteins contain the predicted structural features necessary for lipid transfer: large, hydrophobic binding pockets lined with amphipathic motifs for membrane docking. In contrast, StarAsg2 and StarAsg3 family proteins contain smaller binding cavities and minimal predicted membrane interactions. We found that StarAsg1 from Lokiarcheota interacts with anionic membranes both in vitro and in yeast cells and can transfer sterols between liposomes. Phylogenetic analysis of START domains across the tree of life indicates that eukaryotic LTPs share a common ancestry with StarAsg1 homologs, while StarAsg2 and StarAsg3 form a monophyletic group with eukaryotic heat shock protein cochaperones. We propose that the emergence of proteins for inter-membrane lipid transporters in the ancestors of eukaryotic cells could have facilitated the subsequent development of intracellular organelles.",NA,biorxiv

Comparison to other nanomaterials (polystyrene beads and graphene flakes) confirmed that cancer cells internalize materials similarly to non-cancer cells, indicating GO-specific interactions.

Our structural analysis reveals that GC-rich binding induces significant DNA bending, narrowing the major groove and enhancing peptide interactions. In contrast, AT-rich minor grooves are more extended and electronegative, allowing better stereochemical fitting with planar and aromatic guanidinium side groups of arginine.

In the absence of a ground-truth reference material for cell count, one cannot quantify the accuracy of any cell counting method, which limits method performance assessments and comparisons.

Here, we identify the effector EccB5, a component of the Mtb ESX-5 secretion system, as a key driver of pyroptosis and hyperinflammatory responses. EccB5 enhances Mtb virulence by inducing pyroptosis of macrophages, promoting bacterial dissemination and exacerbating lung pathology. Conditional knockdown EccB5 increases host cell viability. Mechanistically, EccB5 directly interacts with GSDMD, strengthens its association with caspase-1, and facilitates caspase-1-mediated cleavage of GSDMD both in vitro and in vivo.

Here we systematically identify genetic determinants of cancer cell sensitivity to anti-tumor immunity by performing whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screens in autologous tumoroid-T cell co-cultures, isogenic cancer cell models deficient in interferon signaling, and in the context of four cytokines. We discover that loss of CHD1 and MAP3K7 potentiates the transcriptional response to IFN-{gamma}, thereby creating an acquired vulnerability through sensitizing cancer cells to tumor-reactive T cells. Immune checkpoint blockade was more effective in a syngeneic mouse model of melanoma deficient in Chd1 and Map3k7 and was associated with elevated intra-tumoral CD8+ T cell numbers and activation. CHD1 and MAP3K7 are recurrently mutated in cancer and reduced expression in tumors correlates with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients, nominating these genes as potential biomarkers of immunotherapy response.",NA,biorxiv

This critical gap in genetic information poses a substantial barrier to HLA-based research on the continent. In this study, Class I HLA data from Eastern and Southern African populations were analysed to assess genetic diversity across the region. We examined allele and haplotype frequency distributions, deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), linkage disequilibrium (LD), and conducted neutrality tests of homozygosity across various populations. Additionally, the African HLA data were compared to those of Caucasian and African American populations using the Jaccard index and multidimensional scaling (MDS) methods. The study revealed that South African populations exhibited 50.4% more genetic diversity within the Class I HLA region compared to other African populations. Zambia showed an estimated 36.5% genetic diversity, with Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda showing 35.7%, 34.2%, and 31.1%, respectively. Furthermore, an analysis of in-country diversity among diferent tribes indicated an average Class I HLA diversity of 25.7% in Kenya, 17% in Rwanda, 2.8% in South Africa, 13.6% in Uganda, and 6.5% in Zambia. The study also highlighted the genetic distinctness of Caucasian and African American populations compared to African populations. Notably, the diferential frequencies of disease- promoting and disease-preventing HLA alleles across these populations emphasize the urgent need to generate high-quality HLA data for all regions of Africa and its major ethnic groups. Such eforts will be crucial in enhancing healthcare outcomes across the continent.

Author SummaryThis study investigated the diversity of class I HLA in the eastern and southern regions of the African continent using a population genetics approach. Analysis of HLA data at both country and tribal levels revealed significant genetic diferences and the unique characteristics of these populations compared to Caucasian and African American populations in the United States. The diferential frequencies of disease-promoting and disease-preventing HLA alleles across these populations suggest that large-scale vaccine administration may be inefective without a thorough understanding of the HLA composition of each population. This study highlights the urgent need to generate high-quality HLA data across all regions of Africa and its major ethnic groups. Such comprehensive data collection is essential for optimizing vaccine design, deepening our understanding of HLA-disease associations, and ultimately improving healthcare outcomes across the continent.",NA,biorxiv

We use a multi-criteria decision analysis framework to systematically examine the scientific and socioeconomic values and financial costs associated with biodiversity monitoring for vertebrates by scientists and local community members in six protected areas (PAs) in Madagascar, encompassing diverse ecosystems spanning tropical rainforests to spiny deserts. We compare the number of species observed during scientist and community surveys, identify the  ideal number of scientist and community surveys that would be required to maximize the scientific and socioeconomic values of monitoring efforts while minimizing financial cost, and compare monitoring plans across several conservation philosophies representing ""ecocentric"" and ""people-centered"" perspectives. Scientists generally observed more species than community members. However, including a greater proportion of surveys conducted by community members improves wildlife monitoring across PAs, taxonomic groups, and diverse conservation philosophies due to the lower financial cost of travel and compensation relative to monitoring exclusively conducted by scientists. While the valuation schemes we use are simplistic representations of the complex costs and values associated with CBM, this study indicates the benefits of community monitoring regardless of the conservation philosophy used to anchor valuation and decision-making. Increasing integration of CBM into existing conservation management could therefore offer a financially viable method to consistently monitor biodiversity and benefit local communities in the face of limited funding and global challenges.",NA,biorxiv

The model decomposes motion structures into individual and shared sources, highlighting a critical role of surround suppression in detecting global motion. This biologically plausible model sheds light on how the brain extracts the structure of motion and comprehends shared or coherent motion within the visual field. The results obtained from random dot stimuli underscore the delicate balance between sensory data and prior knowledge in coherent motion detection. Model testing across varying noise levels reveals longer convergence times with higher noise, consistent with psychophysical experiments showing that response duration (e.g., reaction time or decision-making time) also increases with noise levels. The model suggests that an excessive emphasis on prior knowledge extends the convergence time in motion detection. Conversely, for faster convergence, the model requires a certain level of prior knowledge to prevent excessive disturbance due to noise. These findings contribute to potential explanations for motion detection deficiencies observed in schizophrenia.",NA,biorxiv

The taxonomy of Eurytomidae, and in particular the large subfamily Eurytominae, needs major revisions as most large genera are recovered as para- or polyphyletic, and the erection of multiple new genera is required in the future to accommodate these taxa. Here, we synonymize the genera Cathilaria (C. certa, C. globiventris, C. opuntiae, and C. rigidae) and the monotypic Aiolomorphus rhopaloides within Tetramesa syn. nov., Parabruchophagus (P. kazakhstanicus, P. nikolskaji, P. rasnitsyni, P. saxatilis, and P. tauricus) and Exeurytoma (E. anatolica, E. caraganae, and E. kebanensis) within Bruchophagus syn. nov..

However, the data acquisition is limited by low spatial frequency EPI artifacts; termed here as Fuzzy Ripples. These artifacts limit the practical applicability of acquisition protocols with higher spatial resolution, faster acquisition speed, and they challenge imaging in lower brain areas.

MethodsWe characterize Fuzzy Ripple artifacts across commonly used sequences and distinguish them from conventional EPI Nyquist ghosts, off-resonance effects, and GRAPPA artifacts. To investigate their origin, we employ dual polarity readouts.

ResultsOur findings indicate that Fuzzy Ripples are primarily caused by readout-specific imperfections in k-space trajectories, which can be exacerbated by inductive coupling between third-order shims and readout gradients. We also find that these artifacts can be mitigated through complex-valued averaging of dual polarity EPI or by disconnecting the third-order shim coils.

ConclusionThe proposed mitigation strategies allow overcoming current limitations in layer-fMRI protocols:

O_LIAchieving resolutions beyond 0.8mm is feasible, and even at 3T, we achieved 0.53mm voxel functional connectivity mapping.
C_LIO_LISub-millimeter sampling acceleration can be increased to allow sub-second TRs and laminar whole brain protocols with up to GRAPPA 8.

We employed rarefaction methods to estimate effort-adjusted species richness due to unequal sampling effort across classes, and analysed community composition using Jaccard dissimilarity and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA). Natural habitats, primarily evergreen and moist deciduous forests, supported the most diverse and functionally specialised bird communities. In contrast, agricultural and urban areas were dominated by generalist guilds such as omnivores and granivores, indicating ecological simplification. Interestingly, tea plantations exhibited high rarefied richness despite lower overall diversity, likely due to uneven sampling patterns.

PWH smoke cigarettes at higher rates than the general population, possibly for self-medication given cognitive-enhancing and anti-inflammatory properties of nicotine, the primary psychoactive ingredient cigarette smoke. We hypothesized that chronic nicotine would improve cognition in a mouse model of HIV, gp120 transgenic (Tg) mice, and reduce neuroinflammation.

MethodsMale and female gp120-Tg mice (n=64) and littermate controls (n=67) were operantly trained then tested for effortful motivation in the progressive ratio breakpoint task (PRBT). Mice were counter-balanced into three groups for saline or nicotine minipump implantation (0, 14 or 40 mg/kg/day) then retested 25 days later in the PRBT, probabilistic reversal learning task (PRLT - reinforcement learning and cognitive flexibility), and Iowa Gambling Task (IGT - risk-based decision-making), with a subset tested for neuroinflammation (Iba-1 levels).

ResultsGp120-Tg mice exhibited worse PRLT performance, attenuated by nicotine. Furthermore, nicotine selectively optimized their response strategies in the PRLT and IGT, increasing loss sensitivity, shifting animals towards ""safer"" responses. No motivation effects were observed. Nicotine also reduced Iba-1 expression, suggesting that its cognitive-enhancing effects may relate to reduced neuroinflammation.

ConclusionGp120-Tg mice exhibited deficits in the PRLT, which are attenuated by chronic nicotine. Furthermore, nicotine improved reinforcement learning and risky decision-making supporting its therapeutic potential for cognitive deficits in PWH, possibly via reducing neuroinflammation. With potential negative consequences of long-term nicotine use, future studies should determine its mechanism of action to develop more targeted therapeutics.",NA,biorxiv

However, invading microbes rarely find novel territories uninhabited. In such a scenario, resident microbes can interact with the newcomers and, in many cases, impede their invasion - an effect known as  biotic resistance. Accordingly, invasions are shaped by the interplay between dispersal and resistance. However, these two factors are difficult to disentangle or manipulate in natural systems, making their interplay difficult to understand. To address this challenge, we tracked microbial invasions in the lab over space and time - first in a model system of two interacting microbes, then in a multi-strain system involving a pathogen invading resident communities. In the presence of biotic resistance, we observed three qualitatively different invasion regimes:  consistent,  pulsed, and  pinned, where, in the third regime, strong biotic resistance stalled the invasion entirely despite ongoing invader dispersal. Surprisingly, these rich invasion dynamics could be qualitatively predicted with a simple, parameter-free framework that ignores individual species interactions, even for rather complex communities. Moreover, we showed that this simple framework could accurately predict simulated invasions from different mechanistic models, indicating its broad applicability. Our work offers a thorough understanding of how biotic resistance impacts invasions and introduces a predictive tool to identify invasion-resistant communities.",NA,biorxiv

Spatial transcriptomic analysis further revealed the localization of these cell types and identified a third stromal population, osteogenic-lineage cells, exclusively present in the bone biopsy. Functional ex vivo assays using sorted stromal populations derived from B-ALL patient bone marrow aspirates demonstrated that both early mesenchymal and adipogenic progenitors secrete key niche-supportive factors, including CXCL12 and Osteopontin, and support leukemic cell survival and chemoresistance. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that B-ALL cells interact differently with stromal subtypes. Notably, adipogenic progenitors, but not early mesenchymal progenitors, provide support to leukemic cells through interleukin-7 and VCAM1 signaling. Stromal cells from B-ALL patients exhibited an enhanced adipogenic differentiation capacity compared to healthy controls. Moreover, co-culture experiments showed that B-ALL cells induce adipogenic differentiation in healthy MSCs through a cell contact-dependent mechanism.

Dried blood spot (DBS) microsampling offers a minimally invasive method for collecting and storing small blood volumes (<50 {micro}L), enabling decentralised and longitudinal sampling. However, its application in lipidomics for cardiometabolic phenotyping remains underexplored. In this study, 34 participants (17 diabetics, 17 non-diabetic controls) self-collected DBS samples using advanced microsampling devices (10 {micro}L, Capitainer(R)B). Lipid extracts were analysed using a validated liquid chromatography-trapped ion mobility-time-of-flight mass spectrometry method optimised for semi-quantitative DBS lipidomics. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences in lipidomic profiles (n = 432 lipids) between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals (R{superscript 2}Y = 0.82, Q{superscript 2}Y = 0.50, p = 0.05). Key discriminatory lipids (all VIP > 1.44), including HexCer(18:1;O2/24:0), HexCer(18:1;O2/22:0), LPC(16:0), PC(O-34:3), TG(18:0_18:1_20:3), and TG(18:1_18:1_22:6), were consistent with matched venous and capillary plasma samples. Lipid class and structural differences, including elevated long-chain triacylglycerols and reduced lysophosphatidylcholines reflected known dyslipidaemia in diabetes and demonstrate the capacity of DBS to capture biologically meaningful lipid perturbations. Participant-reported outcomes from Problem Areas In Diabetes (PAID-20), Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13), and microsampling perception questionnaires highlighted psychosocial and behavioural insights, and indicated strong support for DBS sampling over venepuncture, citing ease of use and reduced burden. These findings establish DBS lipidomics as a feasible and informative approach for stratifying cardiometabolic disease, supporting broader implementation in remote, personalised monitoring frameworks (Figure 1).

In bumblebees, for instance, females (workers) are the main foragers for the colony whereas males (drones) have minimal responsibility. When males leave the nest, however, they become solitary foragers while searching for mates for reproduction. This suggests that increased exploration and behavioural flexibility are crucial for their survival and reproduction success. Here, we compared the exploratory behaviour and behavioural flexibility of male bumblebees (B. terrestris) with that of female workers in a laboratory. We measured bees active time in a novel environment in an exploration task and their colour-reward associative learning ability and behavioural flexibility in a simultaneous two-choice discrimination-reversal colour learning task. As predicted, males were more active (thus explored more) in the novel environment than females. Performance of a colour-reward association learning was comparable between males and females, but males demonstrated enhanced behavioural flexibility when the reward contingency changed. Males used the  win-stay, lose-shift strategy, making fewer errors (being more flexible) than females. Males explorative behaviour may be related to their pre-mating patrolling behaviour in the wild. Their enhanced flexibility suggests their readiness to find profitable flowers when other flowers decrease in quality. These results highlight the importance of exploration and behavioural flexibility for males, which can increase their chance of attracting mates for reproduction and maximising their energy during foraging. Results provide insights into how different traits are related to sex roles in various fitness-related contexts.",NA,biorxiv

Cancer-associated hypomethylation does not occur across the whole genome but leads to the formation of partially methylated domains (PMDs). However, the mechanisms underpinning PMD formation remain unclear. PMDs replicate late in S-phase leading to the proposal that they become hypomethylated due to incomplete re-methylation by the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 during cell division. Here we investigate the role of DNMT1 in the formation of PMDs in cancer by conducting whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), repli-seq and ChIP-seq on DNMT1 knockout HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (DNMT1 KO cells). We find that DNMT1 loss leads to preferential hypomethylation in late replicating, heterochromatic PMDs marked by the constitutive heterochromatic mark H3K9me3 or the facultative heterochromatic mark H3K27me3. However, we also observe that a subset of H3K9me3-marked PMDs gain methylation in DNMT1 KO cells. We find that, in DNMT1 KO cells, these hypermethylated PMDs remain late replicating but gain DNMT3A localisation. This is accompanied by loss of heterochromatic H3K9me3 and specific gain of euchromatic H3K36me2. Our observations suggest that hypermethylated PMDs lose their heterochromatic state, enabling their methylation by DNMT3A and the establishment of a hypermethylated, non-PMD state, despite their late replication timing. More generally, our findings suggest that the de novo DNMTs play a key role in establishing domain level DNA methylation patterns in cancer cells.",NA,biorxiv

ESE was screened for antiviral activity by plaque reduction assays against influenza A viruses (IAV) H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. Time of addition assays and FACS analysis were used to help determine the modes of action. The therapeutic potential of ESE was then explored using differentiated human bronchiole epithelial cells at the air liquid interphase and a murine model challenged with IAV. The data indicates ESE primarily interacts directly with virions, preventing virus cell binding. Interestingly, ESE also inhibits early and late stage of the influenza A lifecycle when treatment occurs after cell binding. This inhibitory effect appears to prevent internalisation of virus and release of progeny virus by targeting neuraminidase activity. Intranasal administration of ESE in mice infected with IAV reduced viral load in lung tissue. ESE may be a promising broad acting antiviral agent in the treatment of influenza infections.",NA,biorxiv

Although ubiquitylation at these subcellular sites has been associated with regulating NF-{kappa}B-related innate immune signaling, the mechanisms of Golgi-localized polyubiquitin chain regulation of immune signaling is not well understood. We report here that the ubiquitin- and LC3B-binding proteins, TNIP1 and autophagy receptors p62, NBR1, NDP52, TAX1BP1, and OPTN associate with STING-induced ubiquitin and LC3B-labeled vesicles, and that p62 and NBR1 act redundantly in spatial clustering of the LC3B-labeled vesicles in the perinuclear region. We also find that while TBK1 kinase activity is not required for the recruitment of TNIP1 and the autophagy receptors, it also plays a role in sequestration of the LC3B-labeled vesicles. The ubiquitin binding domains, rather than the LC3B-interacting regions, of TNIP1 and OPTN are specifically important for their recruitment to Ub/LC3B-associated perinuclear vesicles, while OPTN is also recruited through a TBK1-dependent mechanism. Functionally, we find that TNIP1 and OPTN play a role in STING-mediated innate immune signaling, with TNIP1 acting as a significant negative regulator of both NF-{kappa}B- and Interferon-mediated gene expression.

Competition for ChME can lead to degradation of ELs, triggering large-scale changes in the cell fate information contained in EL. Predicting impending epigenetic tipping points (ETP) by identifying early warning signals (EWS) may help to anticipate the onset of cell identity loss during aging and cancer. We have developed a general mathematical framework that incorporates different connectivity patterns generated by the 3D chromatin folding structure to analyze competition-induced ETP in large EL. This framework allows us to measure the sensitivity and robustness of ETP to the availability of metabolic cofactors and to identify potential EWS. Using a dimension reduction method, we derived coarse-grained (CG) equations for the collective observables associated with chromatin modifications. Analysis of the CG system allows the prediction of global transitions that shape the large-scale features of EL, accurately reproduce the corresponding microscopic benchmarks, and reveal the existence of tipping points under conditions of ChME competition. We applied the CG method to predict ETP under different connectivity patterns, including heterogeneous profiles such as those found in Hi-C data. Although a robustness measure for stable EL was derived from the CG dynamics in bistable regimes, sensitivity analysis revealed that metabolic cofactors have the greatest impact on EL robustness. In particular, we identified the metabolic cofactors SAM and acetyl-CoA as potential EWS for the catastrophic loss of hyperacetylated EL induced by ChME competition. The ability to predict global ETP can facilitate the discovery of predictive biomarkers and inform metabolic interventions aimed at limiting and reversing pathological cell fate decisions.

Author summaryCells maintain their identity through specific patterns of gene expression controlled by structures called ""epigenetic landscapes"" (EL). Deterioration of these EL can occur over time as the enzymatic machineries responsible for maintaining them compete with each other. When this competition reaches a ""tipping point"", cells can undergo critical shifts in cell fate and lose their original identity, leading to aging and cancer. Using mathematical models, the researchers developed a way to accurately predict these tipping points early on, based on ""warning signals"" derived from the abundance levels of metabolites used by chromatin-modifying enzymes. This work could lead to new methods for detecting when cells are about to lose their identity and open the door to metabolic treatments that prevent or reverse this process in aging and cancer.",NA,biorxiv

Recent studies have suggested its dysregulation may contribute to Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis; however, the specific genes and regulatory mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood.

MethodsFour publicly available microarray datasets (GSE5281, GSE29378, GSE36980, and GSE138260) were utilized to investigate genes with differential expression between control and AD samples. Asparagine metabolism-related genes (AMGs) were retrieved from the GeneCards database, and their intersection with DEGs yielded candidate asparagine metabolism-related differentially expressed genes (AMG-DEGs). Functional enrichment analysis (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and centrality scoring identified hub genes. Regulatory mechanisms were investigated through construction of competing endogenous RNA and transcription factor networks. Potential therapeutic compounds were predicted via drug-gene enrichment and evaluated using molecular docking simulations.

ResultsThirty-nine AMG-DEGs were identified and found to be enriched in neurodevelopmental, synaptic transmission, and inflammatory signaling pathways. PPI analysis and centrality screening revealed seven hub genes (HPRT1, GAD2, TUBB3, GFAP, CD44, CCL2, and NFKBIA). Regulatory network analysis highlighted specific miRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and transcription factors involved in their modulation. Drug screening and docking identified Bathocuproine disulfonate, DL-Mevalonic acid, and Phenethyl isothiocyanate as promising compounds with strong binding affinities to hub proteins.

ConclusionThis study comprehensively maps the dysregulation of asparagine metabolism in Alzheimers disease and reveals a set of hub genes and regulatory elements potentially involved in disease progression. The predicted therapeutic compounds provide a foundation for further experimental validation and may contribute to the development of novel metabolism-targeted strategies for AD treatment.",NA,biorxiv

Within the greater Himalayas, Pakistan holds special significance as the north of the country represents a confluence of four major mountain ranges (Hindu Kush, Pamir, Karakoram, and Himalaya). However, robustly surveying and monitoring elusive, low-density species such as snow leopards has historically been difficult in the region. As a result, our understanding of the spatial patterns in density and overall population size of snow leopards has remained conjectural in the  highland crossroads of northern Pakistan. This lack of objective information is an obstacle to realizing effective conservation planning for the species in Pakistan, as well as the broader ecosystem within which it plays a key role. This study aimed to empirically derive population estimates for snow leopards in Pakistan, based on robust camera trapping. Extensive camera trapping was conducted covering about 39% of the snow leopard range in Pakistan from 2010 to 2019, spread across the four major mountain ranges in the north of the country. A total of 828 cameras were placed over 26,540 trap days, resulting in 4,712 photos of snow leopards obtained from 65 different locations. Among the 53 unique individuals identified, the majority (53%) were detected only once, with an overall recapture frequency of 2.28 times per individual. Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) was employed for population and density estimation. Model selection strongly favored a model in which density was positively associated with elevation, and camera type influenced baseline encounter rates. The estimated population size for snow leopards in this highland crossroads was 127 (95% CI 88-182) adult animals, with a mean density of 0.13 (95% CI 0.09-0.19) animals per 100 km{superscript 2}. Examination of the density predictions revealed that higher density areas were associated with protected areas and greater prey biomass, highlighting the importance of these two key factors. This research provides the first robust population estimate for snow leopards in this region, establishing a foundation for long-term population monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of conservation measures. We recommend the integration of complementary approaches, such as non-invasive genetic methods, to validate and refine population estimates.",NA,biorxiv

We identify broad alterations to core metabolic pathways including nutrient uptake, neutral lipid turnover, pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis. Lipidomics, respirometry, lipid and metabolic imaging, and live-cell calorimetry revealed elevated neutral lipid and ATP consumption rates which are coupled with increased heat loss per unit of biomass synthesized despite slower growth. This suggests that compensatory maintenance of lipid asymmetry strains the cellular energy budget, inducing a shift from a growth-promoting anabolic to a more energy-using catabolic state.

We investigated the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-induced targeted recombination in somatic cells to overcome linkage drag surrounding the ToMV locus. We employed two strategies: first, inducing DSBs in both alleles of F1 tomato seedlings to promote non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR); second, targeting a single allele in a heterozygous background to induce HDR in seedlings. CRISPR/Cas9 activity was confirmed in F seedlings by detecting NHEJ-mediated mutations at the target sites in ToMV. We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify targeted recombinants by analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between parental haplotypes, allowing precise tracking of SNP variations. A two-dimensional pooling strategy was employed to distinguish genuine recombination events from PCR artifacts. Despite these advances and the active CRISPR/Cas9 system in F1 progeny, no increase in recombination frequency was observed compared to wild-type plants. We extended our research to protoplasts to assess whether CRISPR/Cas9 could induce targeted recombination under different cellular conditions at the same locus. Consistent with our findings in F1 plants, we observed no increase in recombinant patterns compared to wild-type controls in protoplasts. Our findings suggest that CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSBs are insufficient to break the genetic linkage at the ToMV locus on chromosome 9 in recombination cold spots within somatic cells.

Article SummaryThis research targets plant biologists and geneticists interested in enhancing plant breeding techniques. The study used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to induce DNA breaks in tomato plants. It specifically targeted the Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV) resistance gene, which resists natural recombination. The aim was to induce genetic recombination via CRISPR/Cas9. The highly active CRISPR/Cas9 system did not increase the expected genetic changes, indicating challenges in achieving targeted recombination. These findings highlight the challenges in breaking genetic linkages in specific genome regions using current CRISPR methods. These findings are relevant for developing techniques for targeted recombination in plant breeding.",NA,biorxiv

Because hypoxia in mid-to-late pregnancy is a risk for preeclampsia, we found that levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1- and {beta}-secretase (BACE-1) increased concurrently with placental A{beta} deposition in late stage preeclamptic placentas.

We functionally validated these genes with CRISPR knockout and assessed peritoneal implantation and invasion using the human peritoneal explant model described above. From these data we identified ADAM12 as a key player of peritoneal metastasis. Knock out of ADAM12 significantly impaired peritoneal metastasis in vivo and ex vivo. Exploration of three publicly available independent datasets indicated that ADAM12 is indeed clinically relevant in peritoneal metastasis. To explore the role of ITGA{beta}1 in mediating cell-matrix interactions in the presence of ADAM12, we performed ITGA{beta}1 pull-down assays followed by mass spectrometry analysis in ADAM12 WT cells. ADAM12 KO cells show a marked disruption of the ITGA{beta}1 interactome in GCa cells. Key cytoskeletal proteins such as MYH14, MYH10, MYH9, ACTA2, SPTN1 and TPM1-TPM4 were found to be interactors with ITGA{beta}1 in ADAM12 WT cells but not ADAM12 KO cells. Our approach and the new data identify a distinct peritoneal metastasis gene set that facilitates implantation and invasion of gastric cancer cells within the peritoneum. Disruption of these pathways with peritoneal-directed therapies has the potential to improve survival in patients with high-risk primary gastric cancer.",NA,biorxiv

Our data reveal stereotypical, non-monotonic, and stage-specific alterations in 3D genome folding heterogeneity, compaction, and compartmentalization as cancers progress from normal to preinvasive and ultimately to invasive tumors, discovering a potential structural bottleneck in early tumor progression. Remarkably, 3D genome architectures distinguish histologic cancer states in single cells, despite considerable cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Gene-level analyses of evolutionary changes in 3D genome compartmentalization not only showed compartment-associated genes are more homogeneously regulated, but also elucidated prognostic and dependency genes in lung adenocarcinoma and a previously unappreciated role for polycomb-group protein Rnf2 in 3D genome regulation.

In Bolinao, Philippines, intensive mariculture has led to diatom- or dinoflagellate-dominated HABs since the 2000s, raising risks of paralytic shellfish poisonings and fish kills. In the context of ongoing HAB monitoring and mitigation efforts, we investigated the phytoplankton and associated giant viruses during two seasons (Nov-Dec 2021 and Apr-May 2022). Our sampling encompassed a saxitoxin episode lasting 2.5 months (April-June 2022), and a fish kill (May 15-16, 2022). We used a low-cost flow-through camera (PlanktoScope) and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to identify the dominant phytoplankton. We detected the presence of Alexandrium sp., a known saxitoxin-producing alga, coincident with a toxin alert that resulted in a shellfish ban, even though it was not the dominant taxon. Using electron microscopy, we observed diverse morphologies of virus-like particles (VLPs), including ""giant"" icosahedral VLPs (~200 nm capsids). We assembled giant virus genomes from metagenomic data collected at different bloom phases. Phylogenetic and functional analyses suggest that the recovered genomes are primarily from viruses in the orders Imitervirales and Algavirales, encoding diverse auxiliary metabolic genes involved in nutrient transport and carbohydrate metabolism. The diversity and spatiotemporal dynamics of plankton and their viruses described in this study contributed to our understanding of the broader microbial context of HABs.

ImportanceHABs are widespread phenomena that can be detrimental to livelihoods and health in coastal communities. Understanding what drives their formation, maintenance, and crash could aid in predicting, and potentially alleviating these events. Here, we report on the diversity and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton and giant viruses during a HAB event. Our findings revealed a diverse array of giant viruses belonging to thirteen families in a eutrophic coastal environment. We found evidence of associations between several phytoplankton-giant virus pairs and found a temporal/seasonal influence on phytoplankton-giant virus community structure. While future research is needed to establish definitive links between the giant viruses and HABs species succession, this study lays the groundwork for future mechanistic studies.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we show that AcrVIB1, the only known Acr against Cas13b, principally acts upstream of RNP complex formation by promoting unproductive crRNA binding followed by crRNA degradation. AcrVIB1 tightly binds to Cas13b but not to the Cas13b-crRNA complex, resulting in enhanced rather than blocked crRNA binding. However, the more tightly-bound crRNA does not undergo processing and exhibits altered target RNA binding that fails to activate collateral RNA cleavage. The bound crRNA is also accessible to RNases, leading to crRNA turnover in vivo even in the presence of Cas13b. Finally, cryo-EM structures revealed that AcrVIB1 binds a helical domain of Cas13b responsible for securing the crRNA, keeping the domain in an untethered state.

Here, we found that blocking vesicular release from astrocytes decreased cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus, resulting in impaired adult neurogenesis. Inversely, astrocyte-conditioned medium increased cell proliferation in a vesicular release-dependent manner. We identified PEA116 as a peptide released by astrocytes, that is derived from the c-terminal portion of the PEA15 protein and increased cell proliferation. PEA116 increased ERK2 phosphorylation, decreased the expression of genes involved in aNSC quiescence, resulting in aNSC quiescence exit.

Unfocal designs often employ bendable windings and moveable parts, making realistic simulations of their electric fields in inter-individually varying head sizes and shapes challenging. This hampers comparisons of the various coil designs and prevents systematic evaluations of their dose-response relationships.

ObjectiveIntroduce and validate a novel method for optimizing the position and shape of flexible coils taking individual head anatomies into account. Evaluate the impact of realistic modeling of flexible coils on the electric field simulated in the brain.

MethodsAccurate models of four coils (Brainsway H1, H4, H7; MagVenture MST-Twin) were derived from computed tomography data and mechanical measurements. A generic representation of coil deformations by concatenated linear transformations was introduced and validated. This served as basis for a principled approach to optimize the coil positions and shapes, and to optionally maximize the electric field strength in a region of interest (ROI).

ResultsFor all four coil models, the new method achieved configurations that followed the scalp anatomy while robustly preventing coil-scalp intersections on N=1100 head models. In contrast, setting only the coil center positions without shape deformation regularly led to physically impossible configurations. This also affected the electric field calculated in the cortex, with a median peak difference of [~]16%. In addition, the new method outperformed grid search-based optimization for maximizing the electric field of a standard figure 8 coil in a ROI with a comparable computational complexity.

A conductive matrix not only supports cell growth but also provides potential to stimulate the cells. However, electrically conductive matrices often require inclusion of synthetic polymers, nanomaterials and large number of ionic species. While enhancing electrical conductivity, often properties like transparency, mechanical stiffness and biocompatibility are compromised which can render the resulting matrices partially suitable for neural tissue engineering. Further, the byproducts of matrix degradation can have unforeseen influences. Therefore, electrically active matrices are required which provide a suitable combination of electrical conductivity, mechanical properties and biocompatibility. In this work, a novel biomaterial is described which results in optically transparent, electrically conductive and highly biocompatible matrices along with ability to match the native neural tissue stiffness. Using gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) as base hydrogel, we covalently incorporated zwitterionic functional groups to obtain a composite matrix. The zwitterion moieties were derived from Ornithine by synthesizing ornithine methacryloyl (OrnMA) and blending with GelMA inks. Through systematic characterization we demonstrated the suitability of GelMA-OrnMA hydrogels in providing mechanical stiffness matching the native neural tissues, supporting proliferation of human astrocytes in 3D culture and electrical conductivity in the range required for electrically active cell types like astrocytes.

We studied effects of different visual perturbations in 16 healthy young participants walking on a treadmill, by assessing foot placement and center of mass (CoM) movement. Three different visual perturbations were applied: fixating a stationary target at eye level while the background moved to the right (MB), tracking a target moving rightward over a stationary background with head rotation (MT-HR), and tracking the moving target with eye movement only (MT-EM). Linear models were fit to the kinematics data to predict foot placement from CoM state at mid-swing. Over the whole trial, MT-HR and MT-EM caused an increase in step width variability, CoM position variability and foot placement residual error. During visual perturbation epochs specifically, in MB, a left deviation of foot and CoM trajectories was observed from the start of background movement. In MT-HR and MT-EM, a right deviation of foot and CoM trajectories was observed only after the target had stopped moving. Contrary to our expectations, foot placement errors did not coincide with subsequent CoM deviations in the opposite direction. An obvious change in frontal plane trunk orientation was found only in MT-HR.

Active thin sheet folding promises to be a powerful design technique in the fields of active solids, soft robotics, and synthetic biology. However, the general principles of active thin sheet folding remain poorly understood. Here we discover a non-canonical cilia-driven thin sheet folding behavior exhibited by basal animal Trichoplax adhaerens. Through volumetric imaging, we found that, despite having no nervous system, T. adhaerens has the remarkable ability to resolve complex body folding states in a non-stereotypical fashion using a carpet of collectively flocking cilia. Cilia-resolved imaging revealed that folds create crease defects in the animals ciliary carpet, which act as information bottlenecks to break collective behavior of cilia. In turn, these bottlenecks enable the disjointed locomotion required for fold removal. These findings point to a two-way coupling mechanism, wherein ciliary activity shapes the animals folding state and vice versa. Our work demonstrates the broad configuration space of non-stereotypical active folding and highlights the power of distributed activity to drive folding and unfolding of a thin multicellular sheet.

Therefore, we performed a systematic review of the tick-host relationship of Hyalomma spp in Europe with a focus on Hyalomma marginatum, combined with a meta-analysis and meta-regression to describe its host preference pattern using three outcome values. Our initial qualitative analysis highlighted an increase in tick-host interaction rate in the last decades mostly in South-eastern and Central Europe. H. marginatum also appeared as the species holding the highest citation rate in terms of its association with hosts, and for which the largest number of host species were reported. The meta-analysis on Hyalomma marginatum host choice revealed preferential interactions for horses in the adult stage and birds of the Emberizidae and Strigidae families, in immature stages. Nevertheless, most of the heterogeneity of tick-host interactions remained unexplained suggesting the involvement of multiple drivers such as environmental or climatic conditions. Our results suggest that H. marginatum is a generalist tick whose distribution depends primarily on environmental conditions such as climate and habitat. Current limitations of our meta-analysis approach to identify hosts preference for H. marginatum and suggestions ways for improvement are further discussed.",NA,biorxiv

The timing and type of the transition to independence vary across species, with some achieving independence early, while others rely on prolonged parental care presumably to mature and develop vital skills. When independence is delayed until juveniles reach a certain level of skill, we can expect that skill acquisition rate and proficiency will predict the timing of independence. Here, we investigated whether the acquisition of soaring flight skills can predict the latency to engage in extra-territorial excursions and ultimately emigration from the natal territory marking the onset of independence in golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). While fine-scale soaring flight did not predict the propensity to go on excursions or the timing of emigration, movement at a daily scale did affect latency to excursions and emigration. Together, this indicates that soaring flight is learned quickly and early in life and that movement at the daily scale likely encompasses more than just flight capacity. Adult-like skill levels appear to be a necessary but not the determining factor for emigration, but may determine the timing of excursions. The difference we discovered between when individuals were capable of independence and when they committed to it may obscure the more general link between skill acquisition and the end of parental care in other systems as well.",NA,biorxiv

Heme-containing proteins achieve this by binding O2 to their iron center and have been found to display O2 affinities spanning several orders of magnitude. Despite decades of investigation into the structure and function of heme-based O2 sensors, the molecular mechanisms that enable the tuning of O2 affinity to match specific physiological roles remain unclear. Here, we utilize the O2 sensing mycobacterial DosS protein as a model system to explore the role of heme irons tertiary coordination sphere in controlling its O2 affinity. By rationally and systematically modifying the tertiary coordination sphere to promote the formation of a Trp-Tyr-Asn H-bond triad within the hemes distal pocket, we have enhanced the O2 affinity of WT DosS by over 150-fold. The rationally designed DosS exhibited a Kd value of 3 {+/-} 1 nM, compared to 460 {+/-} 80 nM for WT DosS. Employing a combination of structural, biochemical, spectroscopic, and computational studies, our analysis of WT and designed DosS variants highlights how the interplay between distal H-bond networks and heme-pocket electrostatics drives large differences in their O2 sensing capabilities. Ultimately, our work shows how metalloenzymes can dramatically alter their sensitivity to diatomic signaling molecules by tuning the tertiary coordination sphere, broadly impacting how we understand related biological sensing and signaling.",NA,biorxiv

While societal and environmental factors contribute to this disparity, sex-based biological differences in the processing of pain are also believed to play significant roles. The central lateral nucleus of the amygdala (CeLC) is a key region for the emotional-affective dimension of pain, and a prime target for exploring sex differences in pain processing since a recent study demonstrated sex differences in CGRP actions in this region. Inputs to CeLC from the parabrachial nucleus (PB) play a causal role in aversive processing, and release both glutamate and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP is thought to play a crucial role in chronic pain by potentiating glutamatergic signaling in CeLC.

However, it is not known if this CGRP-mediated synaptic plasticity occurs similarly in males and females. Here, we tested the hypothesis that female CeLC neurons experience greater potentiation of glutamatergic signaling than males following endogenous CGRP exposure. Using trains of optical stimuli to evoke transient CGRP release from PB terminals in CeLC, we find that subsequent glutamatergic responses are preferentially potentiated in CeLC neurons from female mice. This potentiation was CGRP-dependent and involved a postsynaptic mechanism. This sex difference in CGRP sensitivity may explain sex differences in affective pain processing.

Significance statementThe central lateral nucleus of the amygdala (CeLC) receives a dense projection from parabrachial nucleus (PB) neurons that corelease calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and glutamate following aversive stimuli. This PBCGRP[-&gt;]CeLC projection plays a causal role in chronic pain. We show that endogenous CGRP release potentiates glutamate signaling in female, but not male, CeLC neurons. In the context of previous work in male CeLC, this suggests that that females are more sensitive to even transient CGRP release events. Understanding how this sex difference in CGRP sensitivity arises could enhance strategies for treating chronic pain in both women and men.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we investigated how sequence learning reorganizes neural representations and how sleep-dependent consolidation contributes to this transformation. Using high-density electroencephalography and multivariate decoding, we found that learning temporal sequences of visual information led to the incorporation of successor representations during a subsequent perceptual task, despite temporal information being task-irrelevant. Importantly, individuals with better sequence memory performance exhibited stronger successor incorporation during the perceptual task. Representational similarity analyses comparing neural patterns with different layers of a deep neural network revealed a learning-induced shift in representational format, from low-level visual features to higher-level abstract properties. Critically, both the strength and transformation of successor representations correlated with the proportion of slow-wave sleep during a post-learning nap. These findings support the idea that sequence learning induces lasting changes in visual representational geometry and that sleep strengthens these changes, providing mechanistic insights into how the brain updates internal models after exposure to environmental regularities.",NA,biorxiv

Observers (n = 20) matched perceived contrast of a parafoveally presented comparison disc (2{degrees} - 0.33{degrees}) to a standard 2{degrees} disc. For chromatic stimuli, desaturation increased with decreasing size. Unexpectedly, a similar amount of desaturation occurred for luminance-defined discs, once their perceived contrast was adjusted to match the standard chromatic discs. Desaturation was reduced as standard stimulus contrast increased, in line with contrast constancy theory, which predicts constant appearance for stimuli that are sufficiently distant from threshold. Since chromatic contrast sensitivity is reduced away from the fovea, contrast constancy is unachievable within the monitor gamut. In conclusion and somewhat counter-intuitively, the appearance of colour and luminance in the periphery is affected similarly, governed by general laws of contrast sensitivity and constancy.",NA,biorxiv

Although liquid chromatography mass spectrometry proteomics has advanced considerably over the past decade, protein catabolism in natural systems is still difficult to study. One reason for this is the lack of software tools designed specifically for decoding the complex mixtures of peptides that result from in vivo protein digestion. To address this, we developed DigestR, an open-source software tool designed specifically for the analysis of LC-MS proteomics data. DigestR allows users to visualize naturally occurring peptides and align them to a reference proteome at display them at either a proteome-wide and protein-specific level. These visualization tools allow users to track the patters of peptides occurring in natural systems and map naturally-occurring proteolytic cut sites. To demonstrate these functions, we used DigestR to analyze a mixture of peptides resulting from the in vitro digestion of human hemoglobin and bovine albumin with a cocktail of well characterized proteases. As expected, DigestR correctly identified both the proteins involved and the proteolytic cut sites produced by our protease cocktail. We then used DigestR to analyze the complex semi-ordered hemoglobin digestion pathway used by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We show that DigestR successfully identified the proteolytic cut sites linked to the Plasmepsins, a protease known to be involved in hemoglobin digestion by the parasite.

Here, using unbiased proteomics and computational modelling, we identify leucine rich melanocyte differentiation associated (LRMDA) as a novel Commander binding protein. Using recombinant protein reconstitution, we show that LRMDA simultaneously associates with Commander and active RAB32, and, by revealing that LRMDA and SNX17 share a common mechanism of Commander association, establish the mutually exclusive nature of RAB32-LRMDA-Commander and SNX17-Commander assemblies.

It is estimated that 90% of human genes are alternatively spliced. Despite enormous efforts, transcriptome annotations remain, nevertheless, incomplete. Conventional means of annotation were largely driven by experimental data such as RNA-seq and protein sequences, while little insight was shed on understanding transcriptomes and alternative splicings from the perspective of evolution. This study addresses this critical gap by presenting TENNIS (Transcript EvolutioN for New Isoform Splicing), an evolution-based model to predict unannotated isoforms and refine existing annotations without requiring additional data. The model of TENNIS is based on two minimal premises-AS isoforms evolve sequentially from existing isoforms, and each evolutionary step involves a single AS event. We formulate the identification of missing transcripts as an optimization problem and parsimoniously find the minimal number of novel transcripts. Our analysis showed approximately 80% of multi-transcript groups from six transcriptome annotations satisfy our evolutionary model. At a high confidence level, 40% of isoforms predicted by TENNIS were validated by deep long-read RNA-seq. In a simulated incomplete annotation scenario, TENNIS dramatically outperforms two randomized baseline approaches by a 2.25-3 fold-change in precision or a 3.5-3.9 fold-change in recall, after controlling the same level of recall or precision of the baseline methods. These results demonstrate that TENNIS effectively identifies missing transcripts by complying with minimal propositions, offering a powerful approach for transcriptome augmentations through the lens of alternative splicing evolutions.

The advent of irrigation by 6000 yBP switched nitrogen distribution from topsoil to subsoil domains, a change which increased the utility of reduced NRN and MCS. Comparison of allelic frequencies among ancient samples ranging from 5500 to 500 yBP suggest that increased SRN may have appeared around 3500 yBP, coinciding with a period of increased human population, agricultural intensification, and soil degradation.

In this study, we show that lytic HSV-1 infection also leads to an extension of chromatin accessibility at promoters into downstream regions. This is most prominent for highly expressed genes and independent of the immediate-early proteins ICP0, ICP22, and ICP27 and the virion host shutoff protein vhs. ChIPmentation of the noncanonical histone variant H2A.Z, which is strongly enriched at +1 and -1 nucleosomes, indicated that these chromatin accessibility changes are linked to a downstream shift of +1 nucleosomes. In yeast, downstream shifts of +1 nucleosomes are induced by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) degradation. Accordingly, irreversible depletion of Pol II from genes in human cells using -amanitin altered +1 nucleosome positioning similar to lytic HSV-1 infection. Consequently, treatment with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) and knockout of ICP4, which both prevent viral DNA replication and alleviate the loss of Pol II from host genes, largely abolished the downstream extension of accessible chromatin in HSV-1 infection. In the absence of viral DNA replication, doxycycline-induced expression of ICP27, which redirects Pol II from gene bodies into intergenic regions by disrupting transcription termination, induced an attenuated effect that was further enhanced by co-expression of ICP22. In summary, our study provides strong evidence that HSV-1-induced depletion of Pol II from the host genome leads to a downstream shift of +1 nucleosomes at host promoters.

ImportanceLytic herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection leads to a profound host transcription shutoff. Loss of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) in yeast has previously been shown to relax +1 nucleosome positioning to more thermodynamically favorable sites downstream of transcription start sites. Here, we show that a similar phenomenon is likely at play in lytic HSV-1 infection. Sequencing of accessible chromatin revealed a widening of nucleosome-free regions at host promoters into downstream regions. By mapping genome-wide positions of the noncanonical histone variant H2A.Z enriched at +1 and -1 nucleosomes, we demonstrate a downstream shift of +1 nucleosomes for most cellular genes in lytic HSV-1 infection. As chemical depletion of Pol II from genes also leads to a downstream shift of +1 nucleosomes in human cells, changes in chromatin architecture at promoters in HSV-1 infection are likely a consequence of HSV-1-induced loss of Pol II activity from the host genome.",NA,biorxiv

The findings showed significant association between risk status and evolutionary distinctness but only for angiosperm and not for gymnosperm, suggesting that future extinctions may result in a disproportionate pruning of angiosperm tree of life whilst most of the evolutionary history of gymnosperm might persist. To aid bending the curve of loss, we identified most over-threatened clades (e.g., Balsaminaceae) and priority species (e.g., Hymenophyllum exquisitum) for conservation.",NA,biorxiv

The Gallionellaceae Sideroxydans sp. CL21, an autotrophic iron-oxidizing bacteria isolated from a peatland, is unusual amongst FeOB isolates in its genomic potential to utilize organic compounds as energy sources. Therefore, it offers the unique opportunity to determine genes expressed under litho- versus organotrophic conditions. We demonstrated the growth of Sideroxydans sp. CL21 on organic substrates (lactate and pyruvate) and inorganic substrates (Fe(II), magnetite, thiosulfate, and S(0)). Thus, cells were capable of lithoautotrophic, organotrophic, and potentially organoheterotrophic growth. Surprisingly, when lactate-grown cells were given Fe(II), mid-log phase cells were unable to oxidize iron, while late-log phase cells oxidized iron. To elucidate iron oxidation pathways, we compared gene expression between mid-log (non-iron-oxidizing) and late-log (iron-oxidizing) lactate-grown cells. Genes for iron oxidases (cyc2, mtoA) were highly expressed at both time points, so did not correspond to iron oxidation capability, making them unsuitable marker genes of iron oxidation activity by themselves. However, genes encoding periplasmic and inner membrane cytochromes were significantly upregulated in cells capable of iron oxidation. These genes include mtoD, cymA/imoA, and a cluster of Fe(II)-responsive genes (ircABCD). These findings suggest Gallionellaceae regulate their iron oxidation pathways in multiple stages, with iron oxidase-encoding genes proactively expressed. Other genes encoding electron carriers are upregulated only when iron oxidation is needed, which makes these genes (i.e. ircABCD) good prospective indicators of iron oxidation ability.

ImportanceFeOB are widespread in the environment and we suspect that they play key roles in nutrient and other elemental cycles. However, with no isotopic marker, we lack the ability to monitor FeOB activity, prompting us to search for genetic markers. Previous work suggests that expression of iron oxidase genes does not directly correspond to iron oxidation activity in Gallionellaceae and little was known about the other genes in the pathway. Here we study a unique FeOB isolate that possesses organotrophic capabilities and demonstrate its potential for mixotrophic growth on lactate and Fe(II). Its ability to oxidize iron is regulated, allowing us to discover potential iron oxidation pathway genes with expression that corresponds to iron oxidation activity. If these genes can be further validated as iron oxidation marker genes, they will enable us to delineate autotrophic and organoheterotrophic FeOB impacts on carbon cycling in wetlands and other natural and engineered environments.",NA,biorxiv

Genetic concepts can be depicted with lines, letters, shapes, and symbols, and students need to engage their visual literacy skills to appropriately decipher these abstract representations. We previously found that undergraduate course materials almost always represent chromosomes in abstract forms, such as ""X"" shapes or straight lines with a dot for the centromere. We hypothesized that students struggle to apply their visual literacy skills to accurately interpret these abstract representations of chromosomes, which may be related to the frequently-documented incomplete or incorrect ideas students have about chromosome structure and function. To explore students visual literacy related to representations of chromosomes, we conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with students who had taken at least a year of biology courses. We asked them to sketch chromosomes, interpret an abstract representation of chromosomes, and use the abstract representation to answer a question about meiosis. We found that 97% of participants (34 of 35) held conceptual errors related to chromosome structure and function. These conceptual errors were often not evident in participants verbal definitions of chromosomes and were only revealed in their sketches or explanations of their sketches. We found that participants frequently misinterpreted X-shaped representations of chromosomes, mistook unreplicated homologous chromosomes as separated sister chromatids, and held misconceptions related to the structure and function of centromeres. These findings have implications for how chromosomes are taught in biology courses. We recommend that instructors explicitly discuss the conventions and norms of representing chromosomes as a pathway for increasing students visual literacy in molecular biology.",NA,biorxiv

The challenge is to identify explanations that make sense to the biomedical expert. This work proposes discernibility as a new approach to faithfully reflect human cognition, with the users perception of a relationship between explanations and data for a given variable.

MethodsA total of 50 participants (19 biomedical and 31 data scientists) evaluated their perception of the discernibility of explanations from both synthetic and human-based dataset (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). The inter-rater reliability was tested through the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). 13 statistical coefficients were considered to be able to capture for a given variable the relationship between its values and its explanations. A Passing-Bablok regression was performed for each user to highlight the consistency between user rating and each coefficient.

FindingsThe low inter-rater reliability of discernibility (ICC{inverted exclamation}0.5) with no difference between areas of expertise or level of education underlines the need for an objective metric of discernibility. Among all evaluated metrics, dcor metric was found to be the most suitable to capture the intra-individual reliability of discernibility perceived by users (median slope closer to 1 and a narrower confidence interval width for the Passing-Bablok regression with the lowest differential bias between the most and least discernible values).

Interpretationdcor was shown to be a reliable metric for assessing the discernibility of explanations, effectively capturing the clarity of the relationship between the data and their explanations, and providing clues to the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that are not immediately apparent when examining individual predictors. Discernibility can also serve as an evaluation metric for model quality, used to prevent overfitting or aid in feature selection, providing medical practitioners with more accurate and persuasive results.",NA,biorxiv

Recently, the string-pulling task - which involves cyclically reaching, grasping and pulling a string - has been used to study coordinated hand movements in rodents and humans. Here we characterize how adult common marmosets perform the string-pulling task and describe changes in performance across the lifespan. Marmosets (n=15, 7 female) performed a string-pulling task for a food reward using an instrumented apparatus attached to their home-cage. Movement kinematics were acquired using markerless video tracking and we assessed individual hand movements and bimanual coordination using standard metrics. Marmosets appeared to guide their actions with vision and readily performed the string-pulling task regardless of sex or age. The task required very little training and animals routinely engaged in multiple pulling trials per session despite not being under water or food control. All marmosets showed consistent pulling speed and similar hand movements regardless of age. Adult marmosets exhibited a clear hand effect, performing straighter and faster movements with their right hand despite showing idiosyncratic hand preference according to a traditional food retrieval assay. Hand effects were also evident for younger animals but seemed attenuated in the older animals. In terms of bimanual coordination, all adult marmosets demonstrated an alternating movement pattern for vertical hand positions. Two younger and two older marmosets exhibited idiosyncratic coordination patterns even after substantial experience.

In this study, we examined the function of Trus during Drosophila development. CRISPR/Cas9 generated null mutations in trus lead to partial embryonic lethality, significant larval developmental delay, and complete pre-pupal lethality. In mutant larvae, we found decreased cell proliferation and growth defects in the brain and imaginal discs. Mapping relevant tissues for Trus function using trus RNAi and trus mutant rescue experiments revealed that imaginal disc defects are primarily responsible for the developmental delay, while the pre-pupal lethality is likely associated with faulty central nervous system (CNS) development. Examination of the molecular mechanism behind the developmental delay phenotype revealed that trus mutations induce the Xrp1-Dilp8 ribosomal stress-response in growth-impaired imaginal discs, and this signaling pathway attenuates production of the hormone ecdysone in the prothoracic gland. Additional Tap-tagging and mass spectrometry of components in Trus complexes isolated from Drosophila Kc cells identified Ribosomal protein subunit 2 (RpS2), which is coded by string of pearls (sop) in Drosophila, and Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF11) as interacting factors. We discuss the implication of these findings with respect to the similarity and differences in trus genetic null mutant phenotypes compared to the haplo-insufficiency phenotypes produced by heterozygosity for mutants in Minute genes and other genes involved in ribosome biogenesis.

Authors SummaryRibosomes are essential macromolecular machines required for decoding mRNA to make proteins, the major biomolecules that carry out all central cellular functions. As such, their structural and operational integrity is critical to organismal survival, and mutations that disrupt proper stoichiometry or assembly of ribosomes produce serious pathological consequences during an organisms development and/or adult life. The ribosome assembly factor PDCD2L is highly conserved from yeast to man, yet its overall function and requirement during development is poorly understood. By examining the developmental consequences of null mutations in trus, which encodes the Drosophila PDCD2L homolog, we demonstrate an essential role for this factor in cell-cycle regulation. Furthermore, disruption of Trus function in mitotically dividing imaginal tissue activates the Xrp1-dilp8 stress response pathway which limits production of ecdysone, the major arthropod molting hormone, leading to severe developmental delay during larval stages. These studies provide new insights on the requirements of this highly conserved ribosome assemble factor during development.",NA,biorxiv

In this study, we introduce Relative Phase Analysis (RPA), a method that leverages phase-lead/lag relationships to reveal the real-time dynamics of dominant directional patterns and their rapid transitions. We demonstrate that the human brain switches on a sub-second timescale between a top-down mode-where anterior regions drive posterior activity-and a bottom-up mode, characterized by reverse directionality. These dynamics are most pronounced during full consciousness and gradually become less distinct as awareness diminishes. Furthermore, we find from simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings that the top-down mode is expressed when higher-order cognitive networks are more active while the bottom-up mode is expressed when sensory systems are more active. Moreover, comparisons of an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) inattentive cohort with typically developing individuals reveal distinct imbalances in these transition dynamics, highlighting the potential of RPA as a diagnostic biomarker. Complementing our empirical findings, a coupled-oscillator model of the structural brain network recapitulates these emergent patterns, suggesting that such directional modes and transitions may arise naturally from inter-regional neural interactions. Altogether, this study provides a framework for understanding whole-brain dynamics in real-time and identifies sub-second fluctuations in top-down versus bottom-up directionality as a fundamental mechanism underlying human information processing.",NA,biorxiv

One of the emerging paradigms of cell size homeostasis is the adder, where the cell cycle duration is established such that the cell size increase from birth to division is independent of the newborn cell size. We provide a mechanistic formulation of the adder considering that cell size follows any arbitrary non-exponential growth law. Our results show that the main requirement to obtain an adder regardless of the growth law (the time derivative of cell size) is that cell cycle regulators are produced at a rate proportional to the growth law and cell division is triggered when these molecules reach a prescribed threshold level. Among the implications of this generalized adder, we investigate fluctuations in the proliferation of single-cell derived colonies. Considering exponential cell size growth, random fluctuations in clonal size show a transient increase and then eventually decay to zero over time (i.e., clonal populations become asymptotically more similar). In contrast, several forms of non-exponential cell size dynamics (with adder-based cell size control) yield qualitatively different results: clonal size fluctuations monotonically increase over time reaching a non-zero value. These results characterize the interplay between cell size homeostasis at the single-cell level and clonal proliferation at the population level, explaining the broad fluctuations in clonal sizes seen in barcoded human cell lines.",NA,biorxiv

Furthermore, conventional scratch assays only include a single scratch, which leads to a limited evaluation of a restricted cell population within the culture plates, but not of all cells grown in the chamber. There are commercially available  scratch-makers which are highly expensive and yet lack advanced functions such as scratching complex patterns.

We introduce CytoSpatio, open-source software that constructs generative, multirange, and multitype point process models that capture interactions among multiple cell types at various distances simultaneously. On analyzing five cell types across five tissues, our software showed consistent spatial relationships within the same tissue type, with certain cell types like proliferating T cells consistently clustering across tissue types. It also revealed that the attraction-repulsion relationships between cell types like B cells and CD4-positive T cells vary with tissue type. CytoSpatio can also generate synthetic tissue structures that preserve the spatial relationships seen in training images, a capability not provided by previous descriptive, motif-based approaches. This potentially allows spatially realistic simulations of how cell relationships affect tissue biochemistry.",NA,biorxiv

While such profiling of non-model organisms can present unique challenges (e.g. evolutionary idiosyncrasies), high resolution data on immune function could yield valuable insights into ecologically and economically important species. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to profile the immune system transcriptional repertoire of brown trout (Salmo trutta), a threatened index species and commonly using for stocking endangered wild populations, using multiple individuals derived from three distinct rearing backgrounds (wild-caught, farm reared for one generation or farm-reared for at least three generations). We subsequently present a collection of markers that are representative of the species accounting for disparate rearing histories. This revealed a repertoire which is broadly evolutionarily conserved, although many of the genes characterising neutrophil, macrophage, T-cell, B-cell and other lineages likely reflect the specific facets of salmonid immune evolution. The fates of duplicate gene pairs putatively arising from the salmonid-specific whole genome duplication event were also investigated, revealing that approximately half of duplicate genes examined show some degree of functional divergence within the immune system in terms of loss or gain of expression in certain clusters. Finally, comparing cluster-level gene expression profiles between different rearing backgrounds revealed that single or multigenerational exposure to a farm environment induces transcriptional alterations in neutrophils, macrophages, B-cells and T-cells.",NA,biorxiv

We find Salmonella Typhimurium requires chemotactic sensing of two opposing signals present in the intestinal lumen--the microbiota metabolite and bacteriostatic chemorepellent indole, and the nutrient chemoattractant L-Ser--for efficient invasion of colonic tissue. Despite feces being the major biological source of indole, accumulating to millimolar levels, non-typhoidal Salmonella are strongly attracted to fecal material because chemoattraction to L-Ser and other attractants override indole chemorepulsion. This behavior is orchestrated through the chemoreceptor Tsr, which coordinates a spectrum of distinct rearrangements in the bacterial population structure based on the ratio of L-Ser to indole. Through seeking niches with the highest L-Ser to indole ratio, S. Typhimurium presumably optimizes nutrient access and avoids regions of high-competitor density.",NA,biorxiv

This process depends at least in part on plasticity in visual cortex (Widmer et al., 2022). Key signals involved in driving this plasticity are visuomotor prediction errors (Keller et al., 2012; Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018). Ideally however, the amount of plasticity induced by an error signal should be a function of several variables - including overall cortical prediction error, the animals experience in the current environment or task, stability of the current environment, and task engagement - for optimal computational performance. Candidates for regulators of visuomotor prediction error driven plasticity are the three major neuromodulatory systems that innervate visual cortex in the mouse: acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. While visuomotor mismatch acutely triggers activity in noradrenaline (Jordan and Keller, 2023) but not acetylcholine (Yogesh and Keller, 2023) axons in visual cortex, how serotonergic axons in cortex respond to visuomotor mismatch is unknown. The serotonergic system in particular, is an interesting candidate for regulating visuomotor plasticity, as its activity is correlated with action-outcome uncertainty in mice (Grossman et al., 2020), and is increased under conditions of higher visuomotor gain in larval zebra fish (Kawashima et al., 2016). Here, we characterized the activity of serotonergic axons in visual cortex (V1) and in area A24b, a motor cortical area in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), of awake head-fixed mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Our results reveal cortical region-specific responses to visuomotor stimuli in serotonergic axons, but no evidence of a response to visuomotor mismatch. However, average activity in serotonergic axons was increased under conditions of greater visuomotor uncertainty. Thus, serotonin could function to regulate visuomotor plasticity as a function of the predictability of the environment on longer time scales.",NA,biorxiv

We examined the short-term impact of olanzapine, a commonly used second-generation antipsychotic, on the central leptin-mediated regulation of energy balance, lipid metabolism, and hypothalamic kinase activity. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given an acute intracerebroventricular (ICV, 3rd ventricle) injection of either leptin or vehicle, combined with subcutaneous olanzapine or vehicle. As expected, ICV leptin decreased food intake and importantly, olanzapine did not block this effect. Administration of leptin, olanzapine, or their combination reduced the average respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during the light cycle, which indicates that fat oxidation was increased. In the dark cycle, leptin decreased the average RER regardless of olanzapine administration, and in the presence of leptin, olanzapine did not affect the average RER. Leptin did not alter the olanzapine-induced increase in serum triglyceride concentrations. Olanzapine and central leptin treatment differentially activated hypothalamic kinases.

Any imbalance between the rate of material addition and its consequent flow will cause a tip growing cell to either burst because its wall thins or stop growing because its wall thickens. We use an experimentally-inspired feedback law that couples vesicle exocytosis to wall mechanics via the local strain rate to construct a minimal theory for the dynamics of tip growing cells. Our theory characterizes the parameter regime where stable steady tip growth is possible in terms of two dimensionless parameters: a scaled turgor pressure, and a ratio of length scales describing gradients of wall extensibility and vesicle composition near the tip. Our analysis also explains the experimentally observed shape response of tip growing cells observed when external turgor is dynamically varied. All together our formalism provides a general framework for the coupled dynamics of internal vesicular transport and wall mechanics in tip-growing cells.",NA,biorxiv

Secondary students are increasingly involved in scientific research projects that include authentic disciplinary literacy components such as research proposals, posters, videos, and scientific research papers. More and more, students are also engaging in professional practice of publishing their scientific research papers through dedicated secondary science journals. How teachers and other mentors support the development of professional disciplinary literacies in students is critical to understand as part of supporting more student participation in research. To this end, we used a mixed- methods study of interviews and surveys to examine the experience and conceptions of the mentors (teachers and professional scientists) who guided pre-college students through the writing and publication of their scientific research projects. Analyzing our data from a lens of cognitive apprenticeship, we find that mentors encourage independence by primarily employing the method of ""exploration"". We also find that mentors have divergent views on the value of publication within science, versus for student scientists specifically.

Experimental determination of the effects of all possible mutations or those observed in pathogenic individuals is infeasible. While existing state-of-the-art tools such as AlphaMissense show promise, their performance remains insufficient for diagnostic applications, they are often challenging to run locally. To address these limitations, we developed pLM-SAV, a simple yet effective predictor leveraging protein language models (pLMs). Our method computes delta-embeddings by subtracting the embedding of the mutant sequence from that of the wild type sequence. These delta-embedding vectors serve as input for a convolutional neural network used for training and prediction. To prevent data leakage, we trained our model on a well-characterized, labeled set of Eff10k and evaluated it on a non-homologous subset of ClinVar data. Our results demonstrate that this approach performs exceptionally well on the Eff10k test folds and reasonably on ClinVar test sets. Notably, pLM-SAV excels in resolving ambiguous predictions by AlphaMissense. We also found that an ensemble method, REVEL, outperforms both AlphaMissense and pLM-SAV, thus, we integrated these REVEL-enhanced predictions into our widely used AlphaMissense web application, https://alphamissens.hegelab.org.

Considerable recent efforts are therefore being channeled towards understanding the nature of pathogen emergence, their spread and evolution. Xanthomonas euvesicatoria pv. perforans (Xep), one of the causal agents of bacterial spot of tomato, rapidly emerged and displaced other bacterial spot xanthomonads in tomato production regions around the world. In less than three decades, it has become a dominant xanthomonad pathogen in tomato production systems across the world and presents a model for understanding diversification of recently emerged bacterial plant pathogens. Although Xep has been continuously monitored in Florida since its discovery, the global population structure and evolution at the genome-scale is yet to be fully explored. The objectives of this work were to determine genetic diversity globally to ascertain if different tomato production regions contain genetically distinct Xep populations, to examine genetic relatedness of strains collected in tomato seed production areas in East Asia and other production regions, and to evaluate variation in type III effectors, which are critical pathogenicity and virulence factors, in relationship to population structure. We used genome data from 270 strains from 13 countries for phylogenetic analysis and characterization of Xop effector gene diversity among strains. Our results showed notable genetic diversity in the pathogen. We found genetically similar strains in distant tomato production regions, including seed production regions, and diversification over the past 100 years, which is consistent with intercontinental dissemination of the pathogen in hybrid tomato production chains. Evolution of the Xep pangenome, including the acquisition and loss of type III secreted effectors, is apparent within and among phylogenetic lineages.

However, its downstream analyses are often hindered by batch effects, which introduce systematic biases and obscure true biological variations. Existing correction methods, largely developed for scRNA-seq data, struggle to achieve precise control, leading to either over-correction by removing critical biological information, or under-correction by leaving residual batch effects. Moreover, these methods face challenges in adapting to IMC data due to differences in data characteristics. Furthermore, IMC data often feature imbalanced and overlapping cell populations, complicating clustering and downstream analysis. These challenges underscore the need for a robust and controllable batch effect correction approach tailored to IMC data.

ResultsWe present BioBatchNet, a dual-encoder framework utilising adversarial training to explicitly disentangle batch-specific and biological signals. BioBatchNet enables controllable batch effect correction, effectively balancing correction with the preservation of biological variation. We evaluated BioBatchNet on three IMC datasets, where it outperformed seven benchmarking methods with robustness in both correction and biological signal conservation. Additionally, we developed a Constrained Pairwise Clustering (CPC) method, which employs constrained pairs to improve clustering performance, even in datasets with imbalanced and overlapping cell populations. To validate its generalisability, BioBatchNet was also applied to four scRNA-seq datasets, where it delivered competitive performance compared to eight typical methods.

Here, we analyzed global gene expression in response to the necrotrophic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in 23 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions of diverse origin and contrasted QDR phenotype. Over half of the species pan-transcriptome displayed local responses to S. sclerotiorum, with global reprogramming patterns incongruent with accessions phylogeny.

ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to investigate and compare the histological features of excised carotid plaques from Chinese and U.S. patients.

MethodsCarotid endarterectomy specimens collected from two prospective studies were included. The entire plaque was serially sectioned (10 {micro}m thickness) at 0.5-1 mm intervals. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Mallorys trichrome staining were performed. The morphology and components of the plaques were measured and compared between the two groups.

ResultsA total of 1,152 histological sections from 75 Chinese patients and 1,843 sections from 111 U.S. patients were analyzed. The Chinese group had significantly smaller minimum lumen diameters (median: 1.1 vs. 1.3 mm, p=0.046) and a larger percent wall volume (median: 74% vs. 70%, p=0.018) than the U.S. group. After adjusting for confounding factors, carotid plaques in the Chinese population were more likely to have more lipid pools ({beta}=10.0%, 95%CI: 4.9 to 15.9%), more recent intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH; {beta}=8.4%, 95%CI: 4.5 to 12.7%), and less late IPH ({beta}=-8.2%, 95%CI: -11.3 to -5.4), and fewer fibrous cap disruptions (45% vs. 67%, p=0.061). Chinese plaques were more homogeneous and had a higher percentage of plaques with features of xanthomas than did U.S. plaques (20% vs 2.7%, p<0.001).

ConclusionsThe histology of Chinese plaques differs significantly from that of U.S. plaques, suggesting substantial differences in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease between Chinese and North American populations, which could enhance the gap in racial pathology comparison, indicating a need for a different management approach.

While members of the rhizosphere microbiome can protect against pathogens, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the ability to form a robust biofilm on the root surface is necessary for the exclusion of pathogens; however, it is not known if the same biofilm formation components required in vitro are necessary in vivo. Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS365 is a beneficial strain that is phylogenetically closely related to an opportunistic pathogen P. fluorescens N2C3 and confers robust protection against P. fluorescens N2C3 in the rhizosphere. We used this plant-mutualist-pathogen model to screen collections of P. fluorescens WCS365 increased attachment mutants (iam) and surface attachment defective (sad) transposon insertion mutants that form increased or decreased levels of biofilm on an abiotic surface, respectively. We found that while the P. fluorescens WCS365 mutants had altered biofilm formation in vitro, only a subset of these mutants, including those involved in large adhesion protein (Lap) biosynthesis, flagellin biosynthesis and O-antigen biosynthesis, lost protection against P. fluorescens N2C3. We found that the inability of P. fluorescens WCS365 mutants to grow in planta, and the inability to suppress pathogen growth, both partially contributed to loss of plant protection. We did not find a correlation between the extent of biofilm formed in vitro and pathogen protection in planta indicating that biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces may not fully predict pathogen exclusion in planta. Collectively, our work provides insights into mechanisms of biofilm formation and host colonization that shape the outcomes of host-microbe-pathogen interactions.",NA,biorxiv

Current approaches often rely on sequence-based encodings, which fail to fully capture structural and protein-RNA interaction details critical for off-target prediction. In this study, we developed a framework to generate reproducible structure-based chemical features, incorporating both molecular fingerprints and computationally derived siRNA-AGO2 complex structures. Using an RNA-Seq off-target study, we generated over 30,000 siRNA-gene data points and systematically compared nine distinct types of feature representation strategies. Among the datasets, the highest predictive performance was achieved by Dataset 3, which used extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) to encode siRNA and mRNA features. An energy-minimized dataset (7R), representing siRNA-AGO2 structural alignments, was the second-best performer, underscoring the value of incorporating reproducible structural information into feature engineering. Our findings demonstrate that combining detailed structural representations with sequence-based features enables the generation of robust, reproducible chemical features for machine learning models, offering a promising path forward for off-target prediction and siRNA therapeutic design.",NA,biorxiv

Depending on the situation, one might prioritize mnemonic contents (i.e., remembering details of a past event), or preferentially attend sensory inputs (i.e., minding traffic while crossing a street). Previous fMRI work has shown that early sensory regions can simultaneously represent both mnemonic and passively viewed sensory information. Here we test the limits of such simultaneity by manipulating attention towards sensory distractors during a working memory task performed by human subjects during fMRI scanning. Participants remembered the orientation of a target grating while a distractor grating was shown during the middle portion of the memory delay. Critically, there were several subtle changes in the contrast and the orientation of the distractor, and participants were cued to either ignore the distractor, detect a change in contrast, or detect a change in orientation. Despite sensory stimulation being matched in all three conditions, the fidelity of memory representations in early visual cortex was highest when the distractor was ignored, intermediate when participants attended distractor contrast, and lowest when participants attended the orientation of the distractor during the delay. In contrast, the fidelity of distractor representations was lowest when ignoring the distractor, intermediate when attending distractor-contrast, and highest when attending distractor-orientation. These data suggest a trade-off in early sensory representations when engaging top-down feedback to attend both seen and remembered features and may partially explain memory failures that occur when subjects are distracted by external events.",NA,biorxiv

Species that can buffer fluctuations in temperature through tissue or cellular responses in the germline will therefore be more likely to survive moderate temperature stress. Currently, what mechanisms are used in the germline to facilitate maintenance of fertility under moderate temperature stress are unknown. To address this, we investigated how germline apoptosis is modulated in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes in response to moderate temperature stress. We found that wildtype animals increase their germline apoptosis levels from the physiological baseline in response to the moderate temperature stress. This induction of germline apoptosis was dependent on conserved members of the DREAM complex, including LIN-35, the C. elegans homolog of the retinoblastoma tumor and members of the MuvB core, LIN-54 and LIN-37. We also found that LIN-35, LIN-54, and LIN-37 were necessary for DNA damage induced apoptosis. Additionally, induction of germline apoptosis during moderate temperature stress was dependent on repression CED-9 function, the C. elegans Bcl2 ortholog. Finally, we found that changes in cytoplasmic streaming likely lead to changes to oocyte provisioning in wildtype animals but not mutants. Together, these data suggest an expanded role for LIN-35, CED-9, and the DREAM complex in maintaining fertility by activating apoptosis during moderate temperature stress.",NA,biorxiv

Important methodological challenges are accounting for inflation in GWA effect estimates as well as investigating more than one trait simultaneously. We leverage machine learning approaches for these two challenges, developing a computationally efficient method called ML-MAGES. First, we shrink the inflation in GWA effect sizes caused by non-independence among variants using neural networks. We then cluster variant associations among multiple traits via variational inference. We compare the performance of shrinkage via neural networks to regularized regression and fine-mapping, two approaches used for addressing inflated effects but dealing with variants in focal regions of different sizes. Our neural network shrinkage outperforms both methods in approximating the true effect sizes in simulated data. Our infinite mixture clustering approach offers a flexible, data-driven way to distinguish different types of associations--trait-specific, shared across traits, or spurious--among multiple traits based on their regularized effects. Clustering applied to our neural network shrinkage results also produces consistently higher precision and recall for distinguishing gene-level associations in simulations. We demonstrate the application of ML-MAGES on association analyses of two quantitative traits and two binary traits in the UK Biobank (genetic and phenotypic data from 500,000 residents of the UK). Our identified associated genes from single-trait enrichment tests overlap with those having known relevant biological processes to the traits. Besides trait-specific associations, ML-MAGES identifies several variants with shared multi-trait associations, suggesting putative shared genetic architecture.",NA,biorxiv

Filaments dubbed ""cytochrome nanowires"" (CNs) have been resolved by CryoEM, but whether they are the two-decades-long sought-after physiological  nanowires remains unproven. To assess their functional competence, we analyzed biological redox conduction in all CNs by computing driving forces in the presence of redox anti-cooperativities, reorganization energies with electronic polarizability, and Marcus rates for diffusive and protein-limited flux models. The chain of heme cofactors in any CN must be densely packed to realize weak ([&le;]0.01 eV) electronic coupling for electron transfer, as evidenced by a single Soret band produced from coincidental absorptions on multiple hemes. Dense packing, in turn, has three consequences: (1) limited driving forces ([&le;]|0.3| eV) due to shared electrostatic microenvironments, (2) strong ([&le;]0.12 eV) redox anti-cooperativities that would accentuate the free energy landscape if the linear heme arrangement did not dictate a contra-thermodynamic oxidation order, and (3) an entropic penalty that is offset by thioether  tethers of the hemes to the protein backbone. These linkages physically necessitate the rate-throttling T-stacked motif (10-fold slower than the other highly conserved slip-stacked motif). If the sequence of slip- and T-stacked hemes in the CNs had the fastest known nanosecond rates at every step, a micron-long filament would carry a diffusive 0.02 pA current at a physiological 0.1 V, or a protein-limited current of 0.2 pA. Actual CNs have sub-optimal ([&le;]102-fold lower), but sufficient conductivities for cellular respiration, with at most thousands of filaments needed for total cellular metabolic flux. Since cells likely discharge less than the 1.0 pA assumed here, and there are multiple pathways besides CNs for expelling electrons, the micro-to-milli-Siemens/cm conductivities are more than sufficient. Reported conductivities once used to argue for metallic-like pili against the cytochrome hypothesis and now illogically attributed to CNs remain inconsistent by 102-105-fold with the physical constraints imposed on biological redox conduction through multiheme architectures.",10.3389/fchem.2025.1549441,biorxiv

There is still much to be learn what kind of information birds are interested and capable of gathering from conspecifics in the foraging context. We set out to test the social learning skills of a granivorous gregarious species of cardueline finch, the Serin (Serinus serinus), because they likely follow conspecifics cues to forage. We used an observer-demonstrator paradigm where observers were given the opportunity to learn to reach hidden food from observation of demonstrators that were previously trained to perform the task. Almost half of the birds tested were capable of learning (40%) from a conspecific in a colour-food association experiment, and learners were able to remember the association after fifteen days. Also, almost half of the birds tested for this revealed to be capable of reversal learning. The ability to learn was not influenced by sex or age, of both demonstrators and learners, but learners had longer wings than non-learners. We investigated whether personality could explain the differences in learning ability of these birds. We assessed individual boldness and sociability through the novel object test and mirror personality tests respectively.

One of the main factors related to its development is poor nutrition and micronutrient deficiency in the diet. Essential metals, especially divalent ions as zinc, play crucial roles in the neurobiology of the nervous system, including pain signaling and transmission mechanisms, and metabolism control. The present study aimed to understand the impact of zinc in neuropathic pain, evaluating whether restriction and direct repletion of a dietary zinc could change nociceptive behavior and metabolic parameters in adult mice.

MethodsAdult male Swiss mice received a zinc-restricted diet for eight weeks. The repletion group received the restricted diet for four weeks followed by normal zinc diet for another four weeks. Mechanical and heat thermal pain sensitivity were assessed using the von Frey filaments and Hargreaves tests, respectively.

ResultsZinc restriction resulted in decreased body weight gain and led to an increased mechanical and thermal sensitivity to heat. Dietary zinc repletion reversed the thermal allodynia and increased weight gain, abdominal adipose tissue, and liver weight compared to a normal zinc diet. No changes were observed concerning food and water intake, glycemic profile, pancreatic morphology and plasma amylin,

ConclusionsThe reduction in the bioavailability of dietary zinc promotes metabolic and nociceptive changes in adult mice, inducing allodynia characteristic of neuropathic pain.",NA,biorxiv

To characterise stiffness, compressibility, and elasticity, rheological testing included compressive and shear strain protocols, along with recovery and assessments following contraction-induced strength loss. Relative to WT mice, the tibialis anterior of mdx mice were thicker, stiffer, and less compressible. These genotype differences aligned with hydroxyproline content, a marker of fibrosis. Post-deformation recovery was impaired in mdx mice under shear strain, and eccentric contraction-induced injury further increased stiffness and energy dissipation in the tibialis anterior of mdx mice. This rheological platform maintained the in vivo integrity of the tibialis anterior muscle of mice and consistently showed that storage and loss moduli can sensitively detect the detrimental impact of dystrophin-deficiency on the in vivo viscoelastic properties of skeletal muscle.

To reduce complexity and refine the dataset, shorter patterns from the 10% occurrence streamlined the analysis by isolating highly relevant patterns while reducing redundancy among proteins sharing sequence segments. Subsequent analyses integrated structural predictions for protein folding comparison, enabling the detection of patterns in different proteins and the identification of potential key residues. During cavity detection prediction, some amino acids were inspected in detail to assess their impact on protein function and their relevance in drug-target interactions. These insights were considered during docking studies, focusing on proteins used in treatments with pre-described ligands. By connecting raw sequence data to folding structures and functional features, we identified critical protein cavities that underscore the role of mutations in altering protein behavior and influencing drug-target interactions.

At the same time, most genes are not studied or are under-characterized, which hampers our understanding of their function and potential effects on human health and wellness. Understanding function annotation disparity is a necessary first step toward understanding how much functional knowledge is gained from the human genome, and toward guidelines for better targeting future studies of the genes in the human genome effectively. Here, we present a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of the human proteome utilizing data analysis tools from economics and information theory. Specifically, we view the human proteome as a population of proteins within a knowledge economy: we treat the quantified knowledge of the proteins function as the analog of wealth and examine the distribution of information in a population of proteins in the proteome in the same manner distribution of wealth is studied in societies. Our results show a highly skewed distribution of information about human proteins over the last decade, in which the inequality in the annotations given to the proteins remains high. Additionally, we examine the correlation between the knowledge about protein function as captured in databases and the interest in proteins as reflected by mentions in the scientific literature. We show a large gap between knowledge and interest and dissect the factors leading to this gap.

Here, we show that CD8+ CAR T cells undergo two distinct waves of clonal expansion. The first wave is dominated by CAR T cells with an exhausted-like effector memory phenotype during the peak expansion period (day 8-14). The second wave is dominated by CAR T cells with a terminal effector phenotype during the post-peak persistence period (day 21-28). Importantly, the two waves have distinct ontogeny and are biologically uncoupled. Furthermore, lineage tracing analysis via each CAR T cells endogenous TCR clonotype demonstrates that the two waves originate from different effector precursors in the infusion product. Precursors of the first wave exhibit more effector-like signatures, whereas precursors of the second wave exhibit more stem-like signatures. These findings suggest that pre-infusion heterogeneity mediates the two waves of in vivo clonal expansion. Our findings provide evidence against the intuitive idea that the post-peak contraction in CAR abundance is solely apoptosis or extravasation of short-lived CAR T cells from peak expansion.

Fibronectin, a provisional extracellular matrix protein enriched at atheroprone sites, enhances endothelial activation and inflammation triggered by oxLDL and disturbed flow. Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to vascular dysfunction, the role of matrix composition in regulating ER stress remains unknown. We show that oxLDL and disturbed flow induce ER stress selectively in endothelial cells adhered to fibronectin, whereas both stimuli fail to induce ER stress in cells on basement membrane proteins. This matrix-specific ER stress response requires integrin activation, as endothelial cells deficient for integrin activation (talin1 L325R mutation) fail to activate ER stress in response to disturbed flow and oxLDL and direct stimulation of integrin activation using CHAMP peptides is sufficient to trigger ER stress. Blunting endothelial expression of fibronectin-binding integrins (5, v) using siRNA prevents ER stress in response to atherogenic stimuli in vitro, whereas endothelial 5 and v deletion reduces ER stress at atheroprone sites in vivo. The mechanisms driving integrin-dependent ER stress remain unclear, since matrix composition does not affect protein translation, unfolded protein accumulation, or superoxide production, and scavenging superoxide (TEMPOL) does not reduce integrin-dependent ER stress. Inhibiting ER stress with TUDCA reduces proinflammatory and metabolic gene expression (bulk RNAseq) but does not prevent NF-{kappa}B activation, a classic proinflammatory transcription factor. Rather, TUDCA prevents activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-jun activation, and blocking JNK (SP600126) or c-Jun activity (TAM67) prevents proinflammatory gene expression following both stimuli. Together, these findings offer new insight into how the arterial microenvironment contributes to atherogenesis, with fibronectin-binding integrin signaling promotes ER stress in response to mechanical and metabolic stressors, thereby amplying proinflammatory endothelial activation through JNK-c-Jun signaling.

This kind of flexibility depends not just on having prior experience, but on how that experience was structured in the first place. The design of early training curriculum is especially important: poorly structured experiences can hinder abstraction and limit generalization, while carefully structured training promotes more flexible and adaptive behavior. Yet, the neural mechanisms supporting this process remain unclear. To investigate how early training shapes learning we first trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on variants of an odor-timing task previously used to study complex timing behavior in mice. We then tested the RNN predictions on how previous experience affects generalization using behavioral and electrophysiological recordings in mice trained on the same task using staged training sequences. RNNs and mice trained without well-structured early experience developed rigid strategies and made repeated errors. In contrast, those given more balanced early training were better able to generalize and showed similar neural activity patterns that reflected the tasks underlying temporal structure. Using dynamical systems approaches, we reveal a mechanism for this effect: networks trained with appropriately structured curricula developed distinct dynamical motifs that support the correct abstractions when complexity was increased. Networks that lacked early training or received remedial curricula developed single fixed-point solutions that failed to generalize beyond the training stimuli. Together, these findings demonstrate that it is not just the presence of prior experience, but its structure, that governs how flexible and generalizable knowledge emerges in both biological systems and computational models.",NA,biorxiv

Oscillatory behaviour of this contractile network is commonly observed before or during significant morphogenetic events. For instance, during the development of the Drosophila adult abdominal epidermis, larval epithelial cells (LECs) undergo pulsed contractions before being replaced by histoblasts. These contractions involve the formation of contracted regions of concentrated actin and myosin. However, the emergence and control of pulsed contractions are not fully understood. Here, we combined in vivo 4D microscopy with numerical simulations of an active elastomer model applied to realistic cell geometries and boundary conditions to study LEC actomyosin dynamics. The active elastomer model was able to reproduce in vivo observations quantitatively. We also characterised the relationship between cell shape, cell polarity, and actomyosin network parameters with the spatiotemporal characteristics of the contractile network both in vivo and in simulations. Our results show that cell geometry, accompanied by boundary conditions which reflect the cells polarity, is essential to understand the dynamics of the apicomedial actomyosin network.

Interestingly, these bacteria have not been reported to harbour plasmids. Cb-cParM possesses unique properties. Its filaments were stable after nucleotide hydrolysis and Pi release, and its ParR, (Cb-cParR) did not affect the initial stage of Cb-cParM polymerization but displayed properties of a depolymerization factor for mature filaments.

Across gestation, blastocyst-derived trophoblasts facilitate the major functions of the placenta. Specifically, invasive trophoblast subtypes, called extravillous trophoblasts (EVT), play central roles in coordinating nutrient accessibility and maternal immunomodulation to semi-allogeneic fetal and placental tissues. Like the fetus, these trophoblasts can be chromosomally male (XY) or female (XX). While male and female trophoblasts are associated with distinct placental gene signatures, specific differences between male and female EVT have not been defined across the first trimester.

MethodsTo understand how male and female EVT differ, we subjected male and female first trimester EVT cell preparations to bulk RNA sequencing. Concurrently, publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of first trimester placental and decidual tissues were utilized to resolve EVT differentiation and EVT subtype-specific sex differences. Candidate genes were then selected and immuno-localized to specific regions and cell populations in male and female placentas.

ResultsWe found that before week 10 of gestation, both male and female EVT lineage cells increase expression of transcripts associated with cell proliferation. Sex-related gene differences within this early developmental time-point are restricted to genes residing on sex chromosomes. Following week 10 of gestation, there is a broad up-regulation of genes linked to immunoregulation in male and female EVT. However, within this later developmental period, autosomal gene differences appear in relation to biological sex. We go on to show that these sex-dependent autosomal gene differences influence EVT-maternal cell signalling within the uterus whereby pregnancies exposed to a male placenta demonstrate more complex MIF and CD99 as well as angiogenesis-associated VEGF cell-cell signals between male EVT and the female maternal immune and non-immune cells found throughout the uterus.

ConclusionsThese findings resolve early first trimester EVT lineage trophoblast sex differences and highlight a developmental timepoint that is critical to male and female autosomal gene expression.

PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARYThe human placenta is a temporary organ that forms during pregnancy. Importantly, the placenta acts as a surrogate for not yet functioning fetal organ systems (i.e., the heart, lungs, and kidneys) while they mature within the fetus. Because the placenta develops from cells of the early embryo, it can be biologically male or female. Male and female placentas are genetically different from each other, where these differences may differentially influence placental functions and pregnancy health through unknown mechanisms. Therefore, this study aimed to understand how male and female placenta cells differ at the level of gene expression. We find that on week 10 of gestation, but not before, female placenta cells express a different repertoire of genes compared to male placenta cells. We show that these differences potentially affect how cells of the placenta and uterus interact with each other. Taken together, these results identify a developmental timepoint in pregnancy where the biological sex of the placenta may instruct subtle differences in how male or female placenta cells communicate with the maternal compartment in pregnancy.

Significant sex differences have been identified in the prevalence, development, and pathophysiology of obesity and T2D; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to identify sex-specific biomarkers in obesity and T2D and enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with sex differences by integrating expression data.

A systematic review, individual transcriptomic analysis, gene-level meta-analysis, and functional characterization were performed to achieve this aim. Eight studies and 236 subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were analyzed, identifying common and sex-specific biomarkers, many of which were previously associated with obesity or T2D.

The obesity meta-analysis yielded nineteen differentially-expressed biomarkers from a sex-specific perspective (e.g., SPATA18, KREMEN1, NPY4R, and PRM3), while a comparison of the expression profiles between sexes in T2D prompted the identification and validation of specific transcriptomic signatures in males (SAMD9, NBPF3, LDHD, and EHD3) and females (RETN, HEY1, PLPP2, and PM20D2). At the functional level, we highlighted the fundamental role of the Wnt pathway in the development of obesity and T2D in females and the roles of more significant mitochondrial damage and free fatty acids in males.

Overall, our sex-specific meta-analyses supported the detection of differentially expressed genes in males and females associated with the development of obesity and T2D, emphasizing the relevance of sex-based information in biomedical data and opening new avenues for research.

The stringent resource limitations, such as memory constraints, required by some TEEs necessitates the development of computational approaches with reduced memory usage, such as sketching. One example is the SkSES method for GWAS on a cohort of case and control samples from multiple institutions, which identifies the most significant SNPs in a privacy-preserving manner without disclosing sensitive genotype information to other institutions or the cloud service provider. Here we show how to improve the performance of SkSES on large datasets by augmenting it with a learning-augmented approach. Specifically, we show how individual institutions can perform smaller scale GWAS on their own datasets and identify two sets of variants according to certain criteria, which are then used to guide the sketching process to more accurately identify significant variants over the collective dataset. The new method achieves up to 40% accuracy gain compared to the original SkSES method under the same memory constraints on datasets we tested on.

This strategy raises issues of interpretation that we highlight here with a multimodal brain imaging dataset and simulation studies. Twenty-four healthy participants completed neuroimaging with both [11C]Cimbi-36 positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans to estimate receptor binding potential (BP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), respectively, in 18 cortical/subcortical regions. Correlations between BP and CBF were estimated in three ways: 1) Pearson correlation across regions of mean regional BP and CBF ({rho}l), to mimic studies using data from independent cohorts; 2) Pearson correlation between BP and CBF across participants in each region ({rho}2); or 3) the correlation between BP and CBF across participants across all regions within a single linear mixed effects model ({rho}3). We observed a significant positive correlation across regions ([Formula]l = 0.672; p = 0.0023). Region-specific correlations across participants were substantively lower and not statistically significant ([Formula]2: mean = 0.140, range = -0.112 to 0.336; all p > 0.10), nor when estimated simultaneously within a linear mixed model ([Formula]3 = 0.138, p = 0.26). Our simulation study illustrated that regional differences in BP or CBF mean and variance can bias across regions correlations by 1000% or create a type-1 error of 100%. Our observations that both the estimated correlation and the statistical significance can differ greatly highlights that inferring across region correlation as evidence for correlation across participants is erroneous. Without validated methods that limit confounding and other biases, we discourage future studies from inferring across region correlation of population-level brain maps from independent cohorts in this manner.",NA,biorxiv

Such a mechanism requires the internal designation of certain states as subgoals to mark the successful implementation of a behavioral segment. How the brain represents subgoals over time and computes decision values as a function of subgoals is unknown. While most characterizations of hierarchical behavior lack knowledge of the environment, human decision-making also relies on planning with an internal model of the world. Consequently, it remains to be determined how the brain computes values of subgoals using model-based planning in order to drive hierarchical, model-based decisions. Using a sequential-subgoal decision-making task designed to evoke hierarchical, model-based behavior in combination with fMRI, we decoded a representation of the current subgoal in insula and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during decision-making that persisted over time-a critical, latent representation for computing values and orienting behavior in the correct sequence. Using a model-based, hierarchical reinforcement learning model, we also found key decision signals based on values from the model in several regions of frontal cortex. These findings thereby shed light on the neural correlates of subgoal representation and illustrate how value signals can be computed on the basis of these subgoals and knowledge of the environment structure.",NA,biorxiv

PFAS compounds readily contaminate water sources, and as a result, certain PFAS molecules have bioaccumulated in exposed species including humans. The purpose of this study was to define the effect of two PFAS molecules, the ostensibly more toxic perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and the more recent, reportedly safer chemical hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (Gen X), on the development of Lytechinus variegatus sea urchin embryos. We examined the effects of PFOA and Gen X on development and patterning using morphological analysis, immunostaining, HCR-FISH, and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The results show that both PFAS compounds are teratogenic to sea urchin embryos. PFOA and Gen X each function at different intervals during development and provoke distinct phenotypic and gene expression outcomes. Despite beliefs that Gen X would be a safer alternative, our findings indicate that Gen X has earlier and more severe effects on endomesoderm and dorsal-ventral axis specification, neural development and function, and pattern formation compared to PFOA.

Here, we use CRISPR-Translate, a FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening method that exploits translation levels as a readout and identifies PACT as a key inhibitor of PKR during viral infection. We find that cells deficient for PACT hyperactivate PKR in response to several different RNA viruses, raising the question of why cells need to limit PKR activity. Our results demonstrate that PACT cooperates with ADAR1 to suppress PKR activation from self-dsRNAs in uninfected cells. The simultaneous deletion of PACT and ADAR1 results in synthetic lethality, which can be fully rescued in PKR-deficient cells.

A truncated mRNA transcript encoding soluble (s) FLT1 can be generated by premature cleavage and polyadenylation (APA). Although a shortening of transcripts is described in pathological settings, including heart diseases, the functional in vivo impact of FLT1 gene isoform generation and relevance for angiogenesis remain unknown. Here, we show that specific splice site mutations within Flt1 inhibit telescripting and activate APA in vivo to efficiently modulate gene isoform expression, inducing a complete loss of full-length (fl) Flt1 and a switch towards sFlt1 in mice. FLT1 is a high-affinity decoy receptor of VEGF limiting vessel overgrowth. We show that sFLT1 was sufficient for developmental vasculogenesis, whereas flFLT1 controlled ischemia-driven angiogenesis. Our results demonstrate that telescripting is essential in vivo for controlling Flt1 isoform expression and angiogenesis and can be harnessed to improve reparative revascularization. Furthermore, given the widespread abundance of APA signals, our approach may serve as a blueprint for studying telescripting and generating other truncated gene isoforms in vivo.",NA,biorxiv

Host genotype and sex strongly shape this early adaptation, yet their individual and combined effects remain unclear. We experimentally adapted influenza A virus to male and female BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, generating 28 independent lineages, and employed a novel ""rolling sphere"" approach to identify mutational hotspots in three-dimensional protein structures. In BALB/c mice, adaptation favored nonsynonymous substitutions linked to increased virulence, including a hemagglutinin variant exclusively fixed in female lineages. It also revealed the first demonstration of sex-dependent selection shaping a viral protein interface. In female-adapted viruses, substitutions disrupting a key NS1 dimerization motif converged on a single residue, while in male-adapted viruses, they were dispersed across the same interface. Conversely, adaptation to C57BL/6 resulted in fewer substitutions but promoted defective viral genome formation, leading to reduced cytopathic effect and attenuated virulence. This provides the first in vivo evidence that host genotype alone can modulate defective viral genome formation. Our results offer critical insights into host-pathogen interactions and reveal that selective pressures imposed by specific genotype-sex combinations can increase virulence across host genotypes, enabling new epidemiological modeling and disease control strategies.",NA,biorxiv

Flow cytometric cell sorting (often called FACS) is an important tool for understanding this diversity. FACs allows researchers to obtain pure samples of each morphological variant (or morphotype) that is present within a mixed population of cells and thus permits each morphotype to be phenotyped. In FACS, cells are first labeled with fluorescent markers such as antibodies or transgenic constructs, and then separated out based on their possession of these labels. However, since the development of fluorescent labels requires a priori knowledge of bacterial biology, it is often impossible to apply FACS to understudied and/or unculturable bacteria. This challenge has limited our capacity to investigate the biology of bacterial size and shape in all but a small, largely culturable subset of bacterial taxa. Here, we present an innovative strategy that permits label-free cell sorting of bacterial morphotypes, using an unculturable, pleiomorphic pathogen (Pasteuria ramosa) as a model bacterium. We show that imaging flow cytometry (IFC) can be used to systematically identify light-scattering and autofluorescence ""signatures"" of bacterial morphotypes, on which basis cell sorting can be conducted. Critically, our IFC-enabled cell sorting strategy yields samples of sufficient purity (>90%) for common downstream analyses e.g., ""-omics"" analyses. Our work represents an innovative application of IFC and provides an economical, widely applicable solution to a central problem in the study of bacterial diversity.

ImportanceBacteria come in many different shapes and sizes. Why this morphological variation exists is a longstanding question in microbiology, but it remains difficult to answer. To phenotype different morphological variants (morphotypes) within a bacterial population, we need to separate them from one another. This is normally achieved using flow cytometric cell-sorting, whereby morphotypes are labelled with fluorescent antibodies and separated on the basis of their differential fluorescence. Unfortunately, it is difficult to develop fluorescent-labels specific to unculturable or poorly studied bacteria because of the limited availability of appropriate molecular tools. Here, we demonstrate that imaging flow cytometry can be used to design and validate label-free cell sorting strategies. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in bacterial morphological diversity and a call to expand its study across the tree of life. Our work will help microbiologists to answer this call.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we developed PIONEAR-seq, a highly parallel sequencing-based biochemical assay for high-throughput analysis of TF binding to nucleosomes on nucleosome positioning sequences. Using PIONEAR-seq, we characterized the pioneer binding of 7 human pioneer TFs. Comparison of TF binding to nucleosomes based on the synthetic Widom 601 (W601) model sequence versus three different genomic sequences revealed that the positional preferences of these TFs binding to nucleosomes (i.e., dyad, periodic and end binding) is determined by the broader sequence context of the nucleosome, rather than being a property intrinsic to the TF. We propose a model where the flexibility and rigidity within nucleosomal DNA regulate where pioneers bind within nucleosomes.

In cheese production, this variation is influenced by several factors, particularly the milk base and its pretreatment, which shape the microbiome throughout the process and ultimately affect the cheeses organoleptic characteristics. To examine the impact of three different pre-treatments for pasteurised milk-- microfiltration, protein fortification, and only pasteurisation (control)-- on microbiome dynamics, we generated metagenome sequencing data from 14 cheese production steps across these three production trials at a Danish dairy factory. We constructed three metagenomic co-assemblies, identifying nine high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Our analysis revealed that a specific strain of Lactococcus lactis dominates the process, while other minor bacterial species persist at very low abundances (<1%), contributing non-negligibly to product properties. Notably, Clostridium tyrobutyricum, a known dairy spoilage bacterium, was present at low levels in pasteurised-only and protein-fortified milk trials but was nearly absent in microfiltered milk. To enhance our analyses, we implemented KHILL, a novel k-mer-based method applied directly to raw sequencing reads, which facilitates metagenomic co-assembly and enables early detection of unwanted microorganisms. Our findings provide industrial dairy producers with a comprehensive view of microbial dynamics during cheese production, offering insights to improve process consistency and product quality.",NA,biorxiv

In this study we investigated copper amine-oxidases, candidate genes for auxin biosynthesis converting tryptamine into the IAA precursor indole-3-acetyldehyde. After consecutive knock outs of all seven copper amine oxidases the resulting septuple knock out strain had strongly reduced ability to produce auxin. Virulence of the septuple mutant was significantly impaired while DON production in planta was comparable to the wild type.

This study explores the cytosolic peroxiredoxin Tsa1 as a novel regulator of acetic acid metabolism. TSA1 gene deletion revealed strain-dependent effects on acetic acid metabolism and tolerance, showing reduced production and enhanced consumption in laboratory media. Under respiration, Ald4-driven acetic acid production, which raises extracellular pH, was mitigated by the absence of Tsa1. During wine fermentation, TSA1 deletion decreased the initial acetic acid surge by downregulating ALD6 transcription and enzymatic activity. These findings position Tsa1 as a metabolic regulator and a potential target for modulating acetic acid levels to manage volatile acidity and wine quality.",10.1021/acs.jafc.4c13199,biorxiv

This adhesion is mediated by focal adhesions, a protein complex linking the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton. Focal adhesions have been studied extensively in Metazoan mesenchymal cells, but recent research in physiological contexts and amoeboid cells suggest that focal adhesion regulation differs from the mesenchymal focal adhesion paradigm. While focal adhesion machinery predates the origin of Metazoans, focal adhesion formation and regulation during non-Metazoan cell migration is largely unexplored. We used Dictyostelium discoideum to investigate novel mechanisms and the evolution of focal adhesion regulation, as Dictyostelium are non-Metazoans that form cell-substrate adhesion structures for migration. We show that PaxillinB, the Dictyostelium homologue of Paxillin, localizes to dynamic cell-substrate adhesions. As expected, PaxillinB mutations decreased the number of cell-substrate adhesions. Unexpectedly, however, decreased cell-substrate adhesion number led to an increase in cell migration speed. These findings are in direct contrast to Paxillin function at focal adhesions and regulation of cell migration in mammalian cells, challenging the established focal adhesion model and providing insight into the evolution of cell-substrate adhesions and Paxillin function during cell migration.

However, current approaches are limited in their ability to generalize to peptides with novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) due to insufficient training data. To address this challenge, we introduce MoSTERT (Molecular Structure Transformer Encoder for Retention Time prediction) and its enhanced variant, MoSTERT-2S, two transformer-based models designed for zero-shot prediction of retention times of peptides with unseen PTMs. Unlike conventional models, MoSTERT encodes peptide residues at the molecular structure level, allowing it to handle diverse PTMs. MoSTERT-2S further improves accuracy by employing a two-step strategy: first predicting the retention time of the unmodified peptide, then estimating the retention time shift induced by the PTMs.

Evaluation on an external dataset demonstrates that MoSTERT-2S achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing prediction errors compared to existing methods. Its ability to accurately predict retention times for peptides with a wide variety of PTMs not seen during training highlights its potential for advancing proteomic workflows analyzing proteoforms and protein modifications.",NA,biorxiv

However, little information is available about how polyamines improve salt tolerance. Methods: This study was conducted to investigate whether exogenous polyamine application has the potential to maintain poplar growth and yield under a short duration of salt stress. We analyzed the trends in growth and physiological and biochemical responses of hybrid poplar (Populus nigra x maximowiczii, clone NM6) plants to salt stress by foliar application of putrescine (a diamine). Leaves of young greenhouse-grown plants were sprayed with 1 mM putrescine on several days following one-time application of 100 mM and 200 mM NaCl via roots. For measurement of growth, plant height, stem diameter, and leaf number for each plant were recorded throughout the experiment. Studies on the physiological and biochemical trends included gas exchange, total chlorophyll, carotenoids, soluble sugars and proteins, amino acids, polyamines, and relative water content in leaves. Results: Putrescine spray on the salt-treated plants caused a significant increase in chlorophyll a & b, carotenoids, and soluble proteins on a fresh weight basis. Putrescine application caused a significant increase in fructose, glucose, and galactose in all plants, but putrescine spray had a variable impact on the sucrose content of 100 mM NaCl-treated plants. Based on metabolic responses, plants treated with 100 mM NaCl fared better when sprayed with putrescine than those treated with 200 mM NaCl. Discussion: In conclusion, the results indicate that putrescine did reverse the effects of salt in many ways, and there were trends indicating that sprayed putrescine promotes salt tolerance in young poplar plants.",NA,biorxiv

This low prevalence constrains the development of robust transcriptome-based machine learning (ML) classifiers. Standard data-driven classifiers typically require cohorts of over 100 subjects per group to achieve clinical accuracy while managing high-dimensional input ([~]25,000 transcripts). These requirements are infeasible for micro-cohorts of [~]20 individuals, where overfitting becomes pervasive.

ObjectiveTo overcome these constraints, we developed a classification method that integrates three enabling strategies: (i) paired-sample transcriptome dynamics, (ii) N-of-1 pathway-based analytics, and (iii) reproducible machine learning operations (MLOps) for continuous model refinement.

MethodsUnlike ML approaches relying on a single transcriptome per subject, within-subject paired-sample designs -- such as pre-versus post-treatment or diseased versus adjacent-normal tissue -- effectively control intra-individual variability under isogenic conditions and within-subject environmental exposures (e.g. smoking history, other medications, etc.), improve signal-to-noise ratios, and, when pre-processed as single-subject studies (N-of-1), can achieve statistical power comparable to that obtained in animal models. Pathway-level N-of-1 analytics further reduces each samples high-dimensional profile into [~]4,000 biologically interpretable features, annotated with effect sizes, dispersion, and significance. Complementary MLOps practices--automated versioning, continuous monitoring, and adaptive hyperparameter tuning--improve model reproducibility and generalization.

ResultsIn two case studies--human rhinovirus infection versus matched healthy controls (n=16 training; 3 test) and breast cancer tissues harboring TP53 or PIK3CA mutations versus adjacent normal tissue (n=27 training; 9 test)--this approach achieved 90% precision and recall on an unseen breast cancer test set and 92% precision with 90% recall in rhinovirus fivefold cross-validation. Incorporating paired-sample dynamics boosted precision by 8.8% and recall by 6%, while the MLOps workflow yielded additional gains of 14.5% and 12.5%, respectively. Moreover, our method identified 42 critical gene sets (pathways) for rhinovirus response and 21 for cancer mutation status.

ConclusionsThese proof-of-concept results support the utility of integrating intra-subject dynamics, ""biological knowledge""-based feature reduction (pathway-level feature reduction grounded in prior biological knowledge; e.g., N-of-1-pathways analytics), and reproducible MLOps workflows can overcome cohort-size limitations in infrequent disease, offering a scalable, interpretable solution for high-dimensional transcriptomic classification.

The discovery shows how background color plays a role in insects development and brings forward a mechanism of insects camouflage, which is worth further studying.",NA,biorxiv

The initial evolution of microbes in new environments is thought to be driven by regulatory mutations, but it is not clear how this evolution is affected by how quickly conditions change (i.e. dynamics). Here, we perform experimental evolution on continuous cultures of tetracycline resistant E. coli in different dynamical regimens of drug administration. We find that cultures evolved under gradually increasing drug concentrations acquire fine-tuning mutations adapting an alternative efflux pump to tetracycline. However, cultures that are instead periodically exposed to large drug doses evolve transposon insertions resulting in loss of regulation of the main mechanism of tetracycline resistance. A mathematical model shows that sudden drug exposures overwhelm regulated responses, which cannot induce resistance fast enough. These results help explain the frequent loss of regulation of resistance in clinical pathogens.",NA,biorxiv

New compounds are emerging continuously, meaning current testing platforms struggle to keep pace. Objectives Consequently, there is a critical need for simple, rapid, translatable models to provide a scalable screening platform to identify and hazard-assess emerging synthetic opioids, and test potential intervention strategies. Methods Here, we exposed 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) larval zebrafish to a range of concentrations of the prototypical class representative, fentanyl, to investigate behavioral and neural responses. Results Fentanyl caused low concentration hyperactivity, and high concentration hypolocomotion (sedation) which was reversed by the opioid antagonist naloxone. We confirmed predictive validity by replicating the behavioral responses with other class representatives (diacetylmorphine [heroin] and remifentanil). We also confirmed, pharmacologically, that low concentration hyperlocomotion was mediated by dopamine D2 receptors, replicating effects observed in mammals. Further mechanistic investigation using whole-brain in vivo imaging revealed disrupted connectivity in opioid-related circuits, such as the habenulae and dorsal thalamus, alongside novel pathways, including circuits associated with the pineal gland, torus semicircularis and eminentia granularis, potentially highlighting previously uncharacterized sensory and cerebellar neuronal networks. Conclusions These findings support the use of the larval zebrafish as a scalable model for assessment of synthetic opioids to provide novel insights into opioid-induced behaviors and mechanisms of action that may aid strategies in the growing challenge of interventive treatments for synthetic opioid intoxication.

Following meiosis, the microspore undergoes an asymmetric division called pollen mitosis I (PMI), which produces two cells of different sizes: a large vegetative cell and a small generative cell. Polarized nuclear migration and positioning during PMI are important for successful pollen development and cell differentiation. However, analyzing the pollen development process in real-time is challenging in many model plants with tricellular pollen, including Arabidopsis and rice. In this study, we established a method for live confocal imaging of microtubule and actin dynamics using suspension cultures with biolistic delivery of plasmid DNAs during PMI in Nicotiana benthamiana (Benthams tobacco), containing bicellular pollen. Pharmacological studies have indicated that actin filaments are crucial for microspore nuclear positioning before PMI, cell plate expansion during cytokinesis, and chromatin dispersion in vegetative cell nucleus after PMI. By contrast, inhibition of microtubule assembly resulted in abnormal chromosome segregation and nuclear behavior after PMI, although nuclear positioning and asymmetric division were observed. Our in vitro live cell imaging system for PMI provides insights into the importance of cytoskeletal regulation in asymmetric division and differentiation during pollen development.",NA,biorxiv

Functions of IEGs have been known to be different depending on their types. However, there is limited knowledge about the extent to which different types of IEGs are selectively or concurrently involved in the formation of memory engram. To address this question, we investigated the combinative expression of c-Fos, Arc, and Npas4 proteins using immunohistochemistry following aversive and rewarding experiences across subregions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Using an automated cell detection algorithm, we found that expression patterns of c-Fos, Npas4, and Arc varied across different brain areas, with a higher increase of IEG expressing cells in the PFC and posterior BLA than in the DG. The combinative expression patterns, along with their learning-induced changes, also differed across brain areas; the co-expression of IEGs increased in the PFC and BLA following learning whereas the increase was less pronounced in the DG and RSC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different area-to-area functional connectivity networks were extracted by different IEGs. These findings provide insights into how different IEGs and their combinations identify engram cells, which will contribute to a deeper understanding of the functional significance of IEG-tagged memory engram cells.",NA,biorxiv

While adult rainbow trout are known to be sensitive, there is limited research on their early-life stages. Given that early-life stages of fish are often more sensitive than adults, the aim of these studies was to assess the acute and sub-chronic toxicity of 6PPD-Q in early-life stage rainbow trout. Rainbow trout alevins were exposed from hatch until 28 days post-hatch (dph) to time-weighted average 6PPD-Q concentrations ranging from 0.06-2.35 g/L. From these studies, a 28-day median lethal dose (LC50) of 0.56 g/L was derived. Morphological deformities were observed during the exposure period, including pooling of blood in the caudal fin. A follow-up acute study with exogenously feeding rainbow trout fry revealed a 96-hour LC50 of 0.47 g/L. These studies indicate that early-life stage rainbow trout are more sensitive than previously studied sub-adults, with exogenously feeding fry being the most sensitive life stage studied so far, and that sub-chronic exposure to 6PPD-Q can result in developmental abnormalities.

In contrast, there is no PG counterpart that would be universally found in Archaea, but rather various polymers that are specific to some lineages. Methanopyrales and Methanobacteriales are two orders of Euryarchaeota that harbor pseudomurein (PM), a structural analogue of the bacterial PG. Owing to the differences between PG and PM biosynthesis, some have argued that the origin of both polymers is not connected. However, recents studies have revealed that the genomes of PM-containing Archaea encode homologues of the bacterial genes involved in PG biosynthesis, even though neither their specific functions nor the relationships within the corresponding inter-domain phylogenies have been investigated so far. In this work, we devised a pangenomic bioinformatic pipeline to identify proteins for PM biosynthesis in Archaea without prior genetic knowledge. The taxonomic distribution and evolutionary relationships of the candidate proteins were studied in detail in Archaea and Bacteria through HMM sequence mining and phylogenetic inference of the Mur domain-containing family, the ATP-grasp superfamily and the MraY-like family. Our results show that archaeal muramyl ligases are of bacterial origin, but diversified through a mixture of horizontal gene transfers and gene duplications.

The screen uncovered expected pathways, including autophagy, but also unexpected pathways, including UFMylation and GPI anchor synthesis. We discover that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL5SOCS4 is a potent modifier of tau levels in human neurons, ubiquitinates tau, and is a correlated with vulnerability to tauopathies in mouse and human.

This study delves into the cellular architecture and transcriptional profile of Pab-mediated galls, comparing host responses to wild-type Pab and a T3SS-inactive mutant, hrcC-. Morphological analysis using scanning electron microscopy and cross-sectional visualization of infected beet leaf tissues revealed that Pab-induced gall-like structures are linked to cell hyperplasia and tissue ruptures, contingent on T3SS activity. Comparative transcriptome analysis of wild-type Pab and hrcC- Pab-infected beet leaves at 12 and 48 hours unveiled significant transcriptional reprogramming, with nearly 2,000 differentially expressed genes at 48 hours post inoculation. Enrichment analyses identified the upregulation of pathways related to signal transduction, defense, carbohydrate metabolism, and cell wall modulation in wild-type Pab-infected leaves compared to controls. Particularly notable was the significant upregulation of numerous genes associated with cell wall loosening by wild-type Pab, suggesting an initial rearrangement of cell wall architecture facilitates gall formation. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis demonstrated that wild-type Pab suppresses the expression of the betalain biosynthetic gene DOPA 4,5-DIOXYGENASE, leading to reduced betalain accumulation in infected tissues compared to the mutant strain.

Glycosylation is a major post-translational modification, which plays a crucial role in protein function and stability. In cancer biology, abnormal glycosylation can serve as a biomarker and contribute to pathogenesis. We aimed to investigate the effects of glycosylation on LRIG1 functions. Through database analysis and experimental approaches, we focused on evolutionarily conserved glycosylation sites of LRIG1, particularly N74 in humans. We found that a mutation of the N74 glycosylation site (N74Q) enhances LRIG1s binding to EGFR and promotes EGFR degradation. Furthermore, we identified a naturally occurring splice variant of LRIG1 lacking exon 2, which includes the N74 site, that shows similar enhanced EGFR binding and degradation. Analysis of TCGA data revealed that exon 2 skipping in LRIG1 occurs in various cancers, with higher levels correlating with poorer survival in breast and ovarian cancers. Our findings suggest that the absence of glycosylation at N74 enhances LRIG1-EGFR binding, providing an example of glycosylation negatively regulating protein-protein interaction.

This isolated colony inhabits a warmer climate zone, akin to the predicted future environments of polar bears with vastly reduced sea ice habitats, rendering this population of bears particularly important. Over two-thirds of polar bears will be extinct by 2050 with total extinction predicted by the end of this century, therefore understanding possible mechanisms of adaptation via genomic analyses and preservation are critical. Transposable elements (TEs) are parasitic mobile elements that may play a role in an adaptive response to environmental challenges. We analysed transcriptome data from polar bear sub-populations in cooler North- East (NEG) and warmer South-East Greenland (SEG) to compare TE activity between the two populations and its correlation with temperature and associated changes in gene expression. We identified activity hotspots in the genome of regions with significantly differentially expressed TEs. LINE family TEs were the most abundant, and most differentially expressed and divergent in the SEG population compared to reference TEs. We report a significant shift in TE activity and age, with younger more abundant TEs in the SEG populations. Differentially expressed genes in SEG populations were linked to Foxo signalling, ageing and metabolic pathways. Our results provide insights into how a genomic response at the TE level may allow the SEG subpopulations to adapt and survive to climate change and provides a useful resource for conservation in polar bears.",NA,biorxiv

The parameter representing accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers is also introduced. The models equations allow for the numerical calculation of the concentrations of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, as well as free TDP-43 oligomers and those deposited into inclusion bodies. By simulating the deposition of free oligomers into inclusion bodies, the model predicts the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies. An approximate solution to the model equations is derived for the scenario where protein degradation machinery is dysfunctional, leading to infinite half-lives for TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and both free and deposited oligomers. This solution, valid for large times, predicts that the inclusion body radius increases proportionately to the cube root of time, while accumulated neurotoxicity increases linearly with time. To the best of the authors knowledge, this study is the first to model the relationship between the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies and time, as well as the first to introduce the concept of accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers. The sensitivity analysis of the approximate solution indicates that the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity are independent of the kinetic constants at large timescales. While the numerical solution of the full mathematical model continues to work with finite half-lives, the approximate solution becomes invalid for scenarios with physiologically relevant (finite) half-lives of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and free misfolded oligomers. In contrast to the scenario with infinite half-lives, the numerical solution reveals that for different values of the kinetic constants, the curves representing the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity converge to distinct curves as time progresses.",NA,biorxiv

While the literature suggests they cooperate to build the primitive streak, their individual contributions remain poorly understood. Using gastruloids, we found that Wnt/{beta}-catenin drives a genetic program characteristic of the late primitive streak, promoting the development of posterior body structures in a time and dose-dependent manner. Conversely, Nodal activates a distinct transcriptional module resembling the early streak. By engineering gastruloids with varying levels of Nodal signalling, we demonstrate that a decreasing temporal gradient of Nodal activity is critical for establishing the anterior body, with higher Nodal levels producing more anterior structures in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that Nodal and Wnt act antagonistically, initiating distinct developmental modules within the primitive streak. This antagonism is likely the core mechanism driving the early body plan in mammals.",NA,biorxiv

Quantifying uncertainty through global sensitivity analysis is crucial for assessing the robustness and reliability of ABM predictions. However, most global sensitivity methods demand substantial computational resources, making them impractical for highly complex models. Here, we introduce SMoRe GloS (Surrogate Modeling for Recapitulating Global Sensitivity), a novel, computationally efficient method for performing global sensitivity analysis of ABMs. By leveraging explicitly formulated surrogate models, SMoRe GloS allows for comprehensive parameter space exploration and uncertainty quantification without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate our methods flexibility by applying it to two biological ABMs: a simple 2D cell proliferation assay and a complex 3D vascular tumor growth model. Our results show that SMoRe GloS is compatible with simpler methods like the Morris one-at-a-time method, and more computationally intensive variance-based methods like eFAST. SMoRe GloS accurately recovered global sensitivity indices in each case while achieving substantial speedups, completing analyses in minutes. In contrast, direct implementation of eFAST amounted to several days of CPU time for the complex ABM. Remarkably, our method also estimates sensitivities for ABM parameters representing processes not explicitly included in the surrogate model, further enhancing its utility. By making global sensitivity analysis feasible for computationally expensive models, SMoRe GloS opens up new opportunities for uncertainty quantification in complex systems, allowing for more in depth exploration of model behavior, thereby increasing confidence in model predictions.",NA,biorxiv

Although this process involves coordinated interaction between vessels, neurons and glial cells, its dysregulation in neuroinflammation is not well understood.

MethodsWe used in vivo mesoscopic functional ultrasound imaging to monitor cerebral blood volume changes during neuroinflammation in male rats injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the visual cortex, under resting-state or visual stimulation, combined to advanced ex vivo techniques for glial cell reactivity analysis.

FindingsCortical neuroinflammation induced large oscillatory hemodynamic traveling waves in the frequency band of vasomotion ([~]0.1 Hz) in both anesthetized and awake rats. Vasomotor waves traveled through large distances between adjacent penetrating vessels, spanning the entire cortex thickness, and even extending to subcortical areas. Moreover, vasomotion amplitude correlated with microglial morphology changes and was significantly reduced by astrocytic toxins, suggesting that both microglia and astrocytes are involved in the enhancement of vasomotion during neuroinflammation. Notably, functional connectivity was increased under this oscillatory state and functional hyperemia was exacerbated.

InterpretationThese findings reveal new spatiotemporal properties of cerebral vasomotion and suggest this is a major component of brain hemodynamics in pathological states. Moreover, reactive microglia and astrocytes are participating to increased vasomotion during neuroinflammation. For the field of functional neuroimaging, our results advocate for considering 0.1 Hz hemodynamic oscillations as an important complement to traditional measurements, particularly in neuroinflammatory conditions. Indeed, brain hemodynamics may provide insights not only into neuronal activity but also glial reactivity.

While diagnoses of mood disorders are diagnosed twice as frequently in women than in men, most preclinical chronic social defeat stress mouse models exclude females due to decreased aggression toward female intruders.

ObjectivesWe previously reported that the chronic non-discriminatory social defeat stress (CNSDS) paradigm is effective in both sexes, allowing for comparisons between male and female mice. We aimed to improve the screening protocol to identify CD-1 aggressors for use in CNSDS and the method for determining susceptibility to CNSDS. Finally, we aimed to determine whether susceptibility to CNSDS correlated with impaired performance in a satiety- based outcome devaluation task.

MethodsWe analyzed CNSDS screening and social defeat sessions to determine appropriate parameters for selecting CD-1 aggressors and investigated aggressions toward male and female intruder mice. We also investigated CNSDS effects on a reward valuation task.

ResultsWe observed that despite receiving fewer attacks, female mice are equally susceptible to CNSDS as males and that CNSDS abolished satiety-based outcome devaluation in susceptible male and female mice, but not in resilient male and female mice.

The consistency and robustness of developmental cell fate trajectories suggests that complex gene regulatory networks effectively act as low-dimensional cell fate landscapes. A complementary set of works draws on the theory of dynamical systems to argue that cell fate transitions can be categorized into universal decision-making classes. However, the theory connecting geometric landscapes and decision-making classes to high-dimensional gene expression space is still in its infancy. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that allows us to identify gene expression signatures of decision-making classes from single-cell RNA-sequencing time-series data. Our model combines low-dimensional gradient-like dynamical systems and high-dimensional Hopfield networks to capture the interplay between cell fate, gene expression, and signaling pathways. We apply our model to the maturation of alveolar cells in mouse lungs to show that the transient appearance of a mixed alveolar type 1/type 2 state suggests the triple cusp decision-making class. We also analyze lineage-tracing data on hematopoetic differentiation and show that bipotent neutrophil-monocyte progenitors likely undergo a heteroclinic flip bifurcation.

Effective targeting of complement in NDDs requires understanding of its source; in particular, which brain cells express complement genes, how expression is regulated and how expression changes in disease.

To address this knowledge gap, we identified and integrated single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets from 398,097 nuclei across 48 hippocampal samples from non-demented brains to create a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of complement gene expression (""complementome"") in healthy brain. Expression levels of genes encoding complement components, receptors, and regulators were analysed across different brain cell types and the impact of sex and age on complement gene expression tested. To test impact of disease, we generated a further atlas from datasets comprising 11 non-demented and 12 Alzheimers disease (AD) patient hippocampi to assess changes in complement gene expression in AD.

All glial cells in the non-demented hippocampus expressed complement genes. C1Q A/B/C genes were exclusively expressed in microglia, while C3 was highly expressed in microglia and astrocytes. Notably, C3 expression defined a subset of pro-inflammatory microglia. Complement receptor encoding genes (C3AR1, C5AR2, ITGAM, ITGAX, ITGB2, VSIG4) were predominantly expressed in microglia, while neurons expressed a set of brain-specific putative receptors (NPTX 1/2, NPTXR, NRP1). Endothelial cells abundantly expressed key regulators (CD46, CD55, CD59, CFH), while neurons and OPCs expressed a set of putative regulators (CSMD 1/2/3, and SUSD4). Astrocytes abundantly expressed CLU. Cell type-specific gender differences included higher expression of C1Q A/B/C, C1R, C1S in female microglia and higher expression of ITGAM and ITGAX in male microglia. Generally higher complement gene expression was seen in older donors. Compared to controls, AD microglia showed higher expression of C1QB and C3, and AD astrocytes showed higher C1S and C3 expression. Expression of ITGAX was elevated in AD microglia compared to controls, while many AD cell types demonstrated reduced expression of brain-specific putative receptors.

Defining the complementome in non-demented hippocampus provides a baseline for exploration of brain complement expression. Complement expression is upregulated in AD, likely contributing to neuroinflammation and highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

Phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) uses eigenvectors (EVs) derived from the phylogenetic tree as covariates to remove shared evolutionary history. Although conceptually simple and independent of predefined evolutionary models, PVR has traditionally been viewed as inferior to phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS), which explicitly incorporates evolutionary models. Here, we systematically optimized the PVR framework by integrating robust statistical estimators (L1, L2, M, and MM) and developing a theoretically justified approach to selecting EVs, particularly by using the union of EVs from both traits rather than a single trait alone. Using extensive simulations, we compared optimized PVR methods to established approaches, including PGLS and phylogenetic independent contrasts (PIC), across a range of evolutionary scenarios, spanning strong, weak, and asymmetric phylogenetic signals as well as non-stationary shifts; and across multiple tree structures (balanced and ladder-shaped), branch-length scalings ({rho} = 0.1, 1, 2), and sample sizes (128 and 16 species). Our results challenge the prevailing assumption that PGLS universally outperforms PVR. While PGLS and standard PIC generally excelled when dependent traits exhibited strong phylogenetic signals, optimized PVR methods--particularly PVR-MM-- demonstrated superior robustness under scenarios involving mixed or weak phylogenetic signals, as well as abrupt, non-stationary evolutionary shifts. Even the simplest optimized PVR variant (PVR-L2) exhibited inherent robustness, highlighting a fundamental advantage of phylogenetic eigenvectors in controlling evolutionary structure. Furthermore, PVR provides greater methodological flexibility compared to model-based methods like PGLS, as it is not constrained by predefined evolutionary models and can readily extend to advanced machine-learning approaches. Lastly, unlike PGLS, PVR effectively addresses the directional asymmetry inherited from ordinary least squares regression, allowing researchers to select predictors based on biological reasoning or measurement accuracy without compromising model validity. Overall, this study highlights that optimized PVR is not merely a competitive alternative to traditional methods, but also a flexible and robust framework that adapts well to a wide range of evolutionary scenarios and analytical needs.",NA,biorxiv

The search for homology is the rate limiting step for HR, but the dynamics of homology search in vivo are currently poorly understood.

Here, we show that RAD51 and MND1, two proteins operating in homology search, become visible in long filamentous structures several hours after double-stranded break formation. Using GFP-MND1 we can visualize these filaments in living human cells and find that they are highly dynamic, explore the nuclear space, and can resolve over time. We show that the resolution of these filaments depends on RAD54L, known for its role in RAD51-driven homology search and strand-invasion. In addition, we find that loss of cohesin also inhibits the resolution of these filaments, in accordance with a role for cohesin in HR. Thus, our data suggest that these filaments are visible intermediates of an active DNA repair process, and that MND1-GFP can be used as a tool to study the dynamics of homology search in living human cells.",NA,biorxiv

Our recent data showed that preferential pairing occurs between distinct subsets of mTECs and DCs in CAT, providing a rationale for the existence of molecular determinants which control such pairing and the outcome of central tolerance. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of CAT-experienced and -inexperienced DCs and identified Claudin 1 as a molecule involved in CAT-coupled type 1 DC (DC1) maturation. By mapping thymic DC1 heterogeneity, we identified their early and late maturation states. DC1-specific ablation of Claudin 1 led to a reduction in CAT-experienced late mature DC1s and hampered DC1 maturation. These phenotypes correlated with the displacement of DC1s from the vicinity of mTECs. This translated into impaired Treg selection and clonal deletion of TRA-specific T-cells manifested via a break in tolerance and symptoms of multi-organ autoimmunity.

While MRI is widely used because of its high sensitivity for detecting lesions, the range of available types of MR image contrast does not offer high specificity for tumors. Deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI), which combines 2H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) with administration of deuterium-labeled substrates, is a relatively new imaging approach that could provide unique, complementary information to anatomical MRI. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of DMI with intravenous (IV) administration of deuterated choline (2H9-Cho) for tumor characterization; however, they were performed at doses that exceeded severalfold the daily recommended Cho intake.

Here, we investigated the feasibility of oral (PO) administration of 2H9-Cho with a dose set at the recommended upper limit for daily use in humans. DMI was performed in rats with orthotopic glioblastoma tumors following a single, high-dose IV bolus (1 x 285 mg/kg) or low-dose PO administration over three consecutive days (3 x 50 mg/kg). Despite a lower cumulative dose, PO administration resulted in comparable total deuterated Cho (2H9-tCho) concentrations in the tumor, and tumor-to-brain image contrast relative to IV administration. Additionally, 2H and 2D 1H-14N HSQC NMR analyses on excised tumor tissue revealed differences in metabolite contributions to the in vivo 2H9-tCho peak. PO administration led to increased contributions from Cho-derived molecules that were products of tumor metabolism, than during IV infusion of 2H9-Cho. These findings suggest that repeated low-dose PO 2H9- Cho administration can generate high, image contrast between tumor and normal brain, that is predominantly generated by tumor metabolism instead of merely Cho uptake.

These results can advance the clinical translation of tCho-DMI as a noninvasive imaging tool for brain tumor characterization by demonstrating the feasibility of an oral intake approach using a clinically relevant dose. Given that Cho is already a widely used and well-tolerated nutritional supplement, oral Cho administration offers a practical, noninvasive alternative to IV infusion that could be conducted alongside regular MRI.",NA,biorxiv

Deep learning models in particular often require the manual creation of extensive training data, particularly for complex multi-class segmentations. Here, we introduce SPROUT, a novel, semi-automated computer vision method providing a time-efficient and user-friendly pipeline for segmenting and parcellating image data. SPROUT generates seeds (representing parts of an object) based on specified density thresholds and erosion of connected components, to achieve element separation. Seeds are grown to obtain fully-parcellated segmentations.

We resolve this paradox by demonstrating that cercariae utilize a physics-based strategy: they actively accumulate at the air-water interface, transforming inefficient three-dimensional search into effective two-dimensional exploration, increasing host-encounter efficiency by a thousand fold. Our biophysical models demonstrate that this behavior emerges from weight-asymmetric morphology, enabling an embodied algorithm for surface-seeking swimming modes without complex neural control. Surface-swimming cercariae benefit from near-zero vertical flows near the surface, allowing them to remain there while exploiting wind-driven currents for long-distance dispersal. We identify the air-water interface as a critical transmission micro-habitat, suggesting new physical intervention strategies targeting this interface to mitigate transmission of this highly infectious disease.",NA,biorxiv

This aquatic plant has a fast growth rate, a high protein content, and is also a source of important nutrients. Therefore, it could play an important role in food security under climate change and population growth. We provide the first thermal performance curve for W. globosa, and use this data to understand how climate change impacts on temperature in Southeast Asia may affect production. We find that the maximum relative growth rate occurs at constant temperatures of [~]32C. We find no significant difference between growth at current mean conditions and temperatures predicted in the next 40 years according to the high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5 scenario) in Thailand, Laos and Myanmar when temperatures are held constant. However, the thermal performance curve is best described as asymmetric, with growth rates that fall rapidly at temperatures above this optimum. As a result, when temperatures are allowed to fluctuate about the mean in a pattern similar to recent heatwave conditions in Thailand, we find significantly lower growth rates at the optimum than at current mean temperatures. This decrease is driven by a significant increase in frond death at higher temperatures. However, given the fast growth rate of this species relative to other food crops, and the mitigating impact of water on the magnitude of temperature fluctuations, it seems likely that W. globosa may more rapidly recover from extreme heat events than other crop species. Therefore, it is likely to be a suitable candidate for adapting to climate change impacts.",NA,biorxiv

To address this gap, we propose a two-stage approach that achieves both high speed and quantum mechanical (QM) level accuracy. The first stage, termed the validity test, employs an AI-derived force field to identify atoms with elevated energy resulting from implausible neighboring environments. The second stage, known as the rationality test, utilizes a deep learning network trained on data with density functional theory (DFT) accuracy to detect rotatable bonds with high torsional energies.

This  Weber behavior has typically not been the focus of the prominent Bayesian paradigm, which models human perception as an optimal statistical inference conducted on the basis of noisy internal signals. Here we examine the variability of the estimates of a Bayesian observer, in comparison with human subjects. In two preregistered experiments, we manipulate the prior distribution and the reward function in a numerosity-estimation task. When the large numerosities are more frequent, and when they are more rewarding, the Bayesian observer exhibits an  anti-Weber behavior, in which larger magnitudes results in less variable responses. Human subjects exhibit a similar pattern, thus breaking a long-standing result of psychophysics by showing the opposite behavior. This allows subjects to minimize the errors they make about the more frequent or the more rewarding magnitudes. Nevertheless, model fitting suggests that subjects responses are best captured by a model that features a logarithmic encoding, a proposal of Fechner often regarded as accounting for Weber behavior. We thus obtain an anti-Weber behavior together with a Fechner encoding. Our results suggest that the increasing variability may be primarily due to the skewness of natural priors.",NA,biorxiv

Recently, loss of endothelial FABP3 was shown to protect endothelial cells against inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction, however, the effect of FABP3-exposure on endothelial cells is unknown. Accordingly, to study the effect of FABP3-exposure on endothelial cells we performed transcriptomic profiling following recombinant human FABP3 (rhFABP3) treatment to endothelial cells.

MethodCultured human endothelial cells were treated with either vehicle or rhFABP3 (50 ng/ml, 6h) and then RNA-sequencing was performed. Gene expression analysis followed by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed genes and affected cellular functions and pathways.

ResultsDifferential gene expression analysis revealed kinesin family member 26b (KIF26B) as the most upregulated and survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) as the most downregulated genes in rhFABP3-treated in comparison to vehicle-treated endothelial cells. Most of the differentially expressed genes were associated with endothelial cell motility, immune response, and angiogenesis. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that rhFABP3 exposure impacts several crucial pathways, prominently ""Regulation of leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity"" and ""Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity"", suggesting its involvement in endothelial cell physiology and response mechanisms to cardiovascular stress.

ConclusionThis is the first study evaluating rhFABP3-induced transcriptomics in human endothelial cells. Our data reveal novel genes and pathways affected by FABP3-exposure to endothelial cells.

Here we investigated whether v also regulates B cell responses at the respiratory tract during viral infection. Our data show that v integrin restricts tissue-resident B cell responses in the airway, and that deletion of B cell v promotes generation of lung-resident IgA B cell responses following influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Investigating the mechanism for this, we found that loss of B cell v, promotes persistence of GC reactions locally in the lungs, which leads to increases in lung-resident IgA+ memory B cells, cross-reactive to antigenic variants. Thus, these studies reveal how IgA B cells are maintained in the lungs and point to a new strategy to improve the durability of lung-resident IgA B cell responses for IAV vaccine efficacy.",NA,biorxiv

MethodsPrimary human intestinal smooth muscle cells (HISMCs), seeded on electrospun aligned poly-{varepsilon}-caprolactone nano-fibrous scaffolds, were subjected to pathologic, high frequency (1 Hz) uniaxial 3% cyclic stretch (loaded) or kept unloaded in culture for 6 hours. Total RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, and quantitative immunohistochemistry defined loading-induced changes in gene expression. NicheNet predicted how differentially expressed genes might impact HISMCs and other bowel cells.

ResultsLoading induced differential expression of 4537 genes in HISMCs. Loaded HISMCs had a less contractile phenotype, with increased expression of synthetic SMC genes, proinflammatory cytokines, and altered expression of axon guidance molecules, growth factors and morphogens. Many differentially expressed genes encode secreted ligands that could act cell-autonomously on smooth muscle and on other cells in the bowel wall.

Its KO mice exhibit increased impulsivity, impaired short-term spatial memory, failure to adapt to novel environments, and delayed noradrenaline (NA) recovery in the frontal cortex. However, due to its very low expression in the brain, it remains unknown which brain cells express RTL4 and its dynamics in relation to NA. Here, using knock-in mice carrying endogenous Rtl4 fused to Venus, we demonstrated that RTL4 is a microglial gene with several important properties. The RTL4-Venus fusion protein was detected as a secreted protein in the midbrain, hypothalamus, hippocampus and amygdala in the postnatal brain. Its signal intensity was high during critical periods of neonatal adaptation to novel environments and was upregulated by various stimuli, such as handling the mice, mild environmental changes and administration of isoproterenol, an agonist of adrenergic beta receptors. It was decreased by anesthesia but was maintained by the administration of milnacipran, an NA reuptake inhibitor. These results suggest that RTL4 intensity depends on the arousal state via NA and is somehow related to the NA reuptake process. In vitro mixed glial culture experiments demonstrated that Rtl4 is a microglial gene and suggested that RTL4 secretion responds rapidly to isoproterenol. Taken together with previous results from Rtl4 KO mice, microglial RTL4 plays an important role in the NA response and it is likely involved in the development of the NAergic neuronal network in the brain.",NA,biorxiv

Here we analyze pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL) data from 1 305 healthy individuals in the HCP Lifespan studies (5-100 years) to reconstruct a high-resolution normative cerebral blood perfusion map. At the cellular and molecular level, cerebral blood perfusion co-localizes with granular layer IV, biological pathways for maintenance of cellular relaxation potential and mitochondrial organization, and with neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors involved in vasomodulation. At the regional level, blood perfusion aligns with cortical arealization and is greatest in regions with high metabolic demand and resting-state functional hubs. Looking across individuals, blood perfusion is dynamic throughout the lifespan, follows microarchitectural changes in development, and maps onto individual differences in physiological changes in aging. In addition, we find that cortical atrophy in multiple neurodegenerative diseases (late-onset Alzheimers disease, TDP-43C, and dementia with Lewy bodies) is most pronounced in regions with lower perfusion, highlighting the utility of perfusion topography as an indicator of transdiagnostic vulnerability.

In metazoans, chromatin loops and Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) organize genes into transcription factories, while chromosomes occupy nuclear territories in which silent heterochromatin is compartmentalized at the nuclear periphery and active euchromatin localizes to the nucleus center. A similar hierarchical organization occurs in the fungus Neurospora crassa where its seven chromosomes form a Rabl conformation typified by heterochromatic centromeres and telomeres independently clustering at the nuclear membrane, while interspersed heterochromatic loci aggregate across Megabases of linear genomic distance to loop chromatin in TAD-like structures. However, the role of individual heterochromatic loci in normal genome organization and function is unknown.

ResultsWe examined the genome organization of a Neurospora strain harboring a [~]47.4 kilobase deletion within a temporarily silent, facultative heterochromatic region, as well as the genome organization of a strain deleted of a 110.6 kilobase permanently silent constitutive heterochromatic region. While the facultative heterochromatin deletion minimally effects local chromatin structure or telomere clustering, the constitutive heterochromatin deletion alters local chromatin structure, the predicted three-dimensional chromosome conformation, and the expression of some genes, which are qualitatively repositioned into the nucleus center, while increasing Hi-C variability.

ConclusionsOur work elucidates how an individual constitutive heterochromatic region impacts genome organization and function.

In this work, we performed classical Molecular Dynamics simulations for the tau-R2/tubulin assembly with various phosphorylations states of serines 285, 289 and 293. We analyze the resulting trajectories to obtain a detailed view of the protein interface in the complex, and the impact of tau phosphorylations on the stability of this assembly, and on the tubulin disordered C-Terminal tails (CTTs) mobility. We show how the tubulin CTTs help maintaining the tau-R2 fragment on the tubulin surface despite the destabilizing effect induced by phosphorylations. Conversely, tau phosphorylation affects the CTTs flexibility and their potential activity as MAP recruiting hooks. Furthermore, counterion mediated bridges between the phosphate groups and tubulin glutamates also contribute to the binding of tau-R2 on the MT. Overall, the complex dynamics of this fuzzy phosphorylated assembly sheds a new light on the importance of the cytoplasmic environment in neurons in the context of Alzheimers disease.",NA,biorxiv

Here we investigate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon by calling mtDNA sequence, abundance, and heteroplasmic variation in human blood using whole genome sequences from [~]750,000 individuals. Our analyses reveal a simple, two-step mechanism: first, individual cells randomly accumulate low levels of ""cryptic"" mtDNA mutations; then, when a cell clone proliferates, the cryptic mtDNA variants are carried as passenger mutations and become detectable in whole blood. Four lines of evidence support this model: (1) the mutational spectrum of age-accumulating mtDNA variants is consistent with a well-established model of mtDNA replication errors, (2) these mutations are found primarily at low levels of heteroplasmy and do not show evidence of positive selection, (3) high mtDNA mutation burden tends to co-occur in samples harboring somatic driver mutations for clonal hematopoiesis (CH), and (4) nuclear GWAS reveals that germline variants predisposing to CH (such as those near TERT, TCL1A, and SMC4) also increase mtDNA mutation burden. We propose that the high copy number and high mutation rate of mtDNA make it a particularly sensitive blood-based marker of CH. Importantly, our work helps to mechanistically unify three prominent signatures of aging: common germline variants in TERT, clonal hematopoiesis, and observed mtDNA mutation accrual.",NA,biorxiv

Specifically, stiffness captures Alzheimers disease (AD), while damping ratio detects subtle changes associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Our regional analysis identifies deep brain structures, particularly the caudate and thalamus, as key biomarkers of aging. The greater age sensitivity of MRE translates to superior differentiation of AD and MCI from healthy individuals, pinpointing regions where significant biomechanical alterations occur, notably the thalamus in AD and hippocampus in MCI. Furthermore, our results reveal biomechanical alterations in cognitively healthy individuals whose aging profiles closely resemble patients with MCI and AD.

We show that the IPN receives extensive projections from the tegmentum, and reveal a strict segregation between the dorsal (dIPN) and ventral (vIPN) subcircuits, with minimal cross-communication. In the dIPN, we characterise in detail the inputs and outputs of r1{pi} neurons, which have been recently identified as representing the animals heading direction. In the vIPN, we identify six distinct glomerular structures, each exhibiting specific patterns of reciprocal connections and projection pathways.

Selected lines also increased in larval growth rate (+19%) and average protein content (+14%), suggesting that selection on large body size does not result in strong trade-offs. In contrast to the predictability of the phenotypic response across replicates, whole genome sequencing identified a highly polygenic and non-repeatable genomic response. We identified 120, 301 and 157 outlier genomic regions in the three replicates, but high redundancy with only four shared regions. Among 12 candidate genes found in these regions, the insulin-like receptor gene (HiInR) was confirmed as regulating larval growth using a CRISPR knockout experiment.

Here we train a version of the DeepTangle algorithm developed for swimming worms using a combination of data derived from Tierpsy tracker and hand-annotated data for more difficult cases. DeepTangleCrawl (DTC) outperforms existing methods, reducing failure rates and producing more continuous, gap-free worm trajectories that are less likely to be interrupted by collisions between worms or self-intersecting postures (coils). We show that DTC enables the analysis of previously inaccessible behaviours and increases the signal-to-noise ratio in phenotypic screens, even for data that was specifically collected to be compatible with legacy trackers including low worm density and thin bacterial lawns.

At the same time each of these organs has been demonstrated to interact with neural activity and behaviour. To what extent then should different organs be treated as separate modalities in interoception? We here aim to answer this question by assessing in human participants whether the phase of these visceral rhythms is coupled to the corticospinal excitability of the motor system, and whether this coupling happens in an organ-specific or organ-general manner. We combined continuous physiological recordings with single pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to probe phase-amplitude coupling between the phase of the cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythm and the amplitude of Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP). All three visceral rhythms contributed to MEP amplitude with similar effect sizes at the group level. However, we found no relation between coupling strengths with corticospinal excitability between the three organs. Thus, participants displaying high coupling with one organ did not necessarily display high coupling to the other organs, suggestive of unique interoceptive profiles. There was also no link between self-reported awareness of the organ and the actual coupling, suggesting these are distinct dimensions of interoception. Together these results show that each coupling is mediated by at least partially independent mechanisms.",NA,biorxiv

In this study, we explored the potential of evolving bacterial biofilm communities to enhance polyethylene degradation. Through long-term experimental evolution, six microbial populations underwent 40 selection cycles using polyethylene as their sole carbon source. The resulting evolved communities formed robust, multi-species biofilms with enhanced degradation capabilities, outperforming their ancestral populations in biofilm production. Pseudomonas stutzeri emerged as the dominant species, orchestrating a synergistic interaction with two other isolates through metabolic division of labor.

Proteins are modelled as particles with two internal states: a ground state representing the native configuration and a degenerate excited state representing unfolded configurations. The computed phase diagrams reveal an anomalous reentrant phase separation behavior with both upper and lower critical solution temperatures, providing insights into its underlying mechanism. We also explored non-equilibrium effects, such as non-Boltzmann population distribution of native and unfolded states, and enhanced translational diffusion due to non-thermal noise on the phase separation.

To meet this need, we introduce PAV-spotter: a tool that can identify presence/absence variation (PAV) in target capture data. PAV-spotter conducts a signal cross-correlation calculation, in which the distribution of read counts per target between samples of different a priori defined classes - e.g. male versus female, or diseased versus healthy - are compared.

Triturus newts suffer from a hereditary disease that kills half their offspring during embryogenesis. We compare the target capture data of two different types of diseased embryos, characterized by unique deletions, with those of healthy embryos.

Estimating soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) at the daily time-step is crucial in providing fertilizer recommendations balancing plant nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and N losses to the environment. Crop models [e.g., Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT)] can simulate the trend of SMN in varied fertilizer rates and timing of application but are unable to replicate its magnitude due to the inability to capture high-water table conditions in a sub-irrigated soil. As an alternative to such physics-based model, time-series deep learning (DL) models based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) are promising in understanding nonlinearity among complex variables. Yet, purely data-driven DL models for crops are difficult to obtain due to the insufficient amount of data available and the excessive costs with producing more data. To address this challenge, a hybrid model (hybrid-LSTM) was developed by leveraging both the DSSAT and LSTM models to estimate daily SMN primarily using daily weather, applied fertilizer rates-timings, and the SMN sparse observations. This study used the observations from field trials conducted between 2010-2014 in Hastings, FL. The first step was to calibrate the DSSAT-SUBSTOR-Potato model to produce reliable SMN of the topsoil for treatments with varied N applied fertilizer rates split among the pre-planting, emergence, and tuber-initiation stages of the potato crop. Thereafter, the hybrid-LSTM model was trained on the calibrated DSSAT simulated SMN time-series and fine-tuned its predictions using the observed SMN to improve DSSAT simulated SMN. The hybrid-LSTM model was then tested on both calibrated and uncalibrated DSSAT SMN simulations where it outperformed the DSSAT model (range of improvement ranged [~]18-30% on comparing the normalized root mean squared error) in providing reliable estimates of SMN across most of the farms and years.

Self-reported depression and anhedonia were associated with reduced total sleep duration across multiple age groups and both sexes. These collective results indicate that the timing, consistency, and overall amount of sleep differs by age and is affected by individual factors.",NA,biorxiv

Fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms and architectures present a substantial power demand from onboard batteries in implantable medical devices, necessitating the development of ultra-low power Fourier transform methods in resource-constrained environments. Numerous FFT architectures aim to optimize power and resource demand through computational efficiency; however, prioritizing the reduction of logic complexity at the cost of additional computations can be equally or more effective. This paper introduces a minimal-architecture single-delay feedback discrete Fourier transform (mSDF-DFT) for use in ultra-low-power field programmable gate array applications and shows energy and power improvements over state-of-the-art low-power DFT and FFT methods. In a neural sensing application, we observe a 33% reduction in dynamic power and 4% reduction in resource utilization when compared to state-of-the-art FFT algorithms; 38% reduction in dynamic power and 4% reduction in resource utilization when compared to Goertzel Algorithm. While designed for use in closed-loop deep brain stimulation and medical device implementations, the mSDF-DFT is also easily extendable to any ultra-low-power embedded application.",NA,biorxiv

Recent research suggests that acoustic background noise can enhance neural speech tracking, enabling the auditory system to robustly encode speech even under unfavorable conditions. Aging and hearing loss are associated with internal, neural noise in the auditory system, raising the question whether additional acoustic background noise enhances neural speech tracking in older adults. In the current electroencephalography study, younger ([~]25.5 years) and older adults ([~]68.5 years) listened to spoken stories in quiet (clear) or in the presence of background noise at a wide range of different signal-to-noise ratios. In younger adults, early neural speech tracking responses (<0.15 s) were enhanced by minimal background noise, indicating response facilitation through noise. In contrast, older adults, compared to younger adults, showed enhanced neural speech tracking for clear speech and speech masked by minimal background noise, but the acoustic noise led to little enhancement of the early neural tracking response in older people. The data demonstrate different sensitivity of the auditory cortex to speech masked by noise between younger and older adults. The results are consistent with the idea that the auditory cortex of older people exhibits more internal, neural noise that enhances neural speech tracking but that additional acoustic noise does not further support speech encoding. The work points to a highly non-linear auditory system that differs between younger and older adults.",NA,biorxiv

We used publicly available data to map the Area of Habitat (AOH) for each of the 149 land birds in South America listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as either Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable (the latter only under criterion D - those with the smallest populations or ranges). We then set two minimum conservation targets for each species: first a population-based target that estimates the proportion of the AOH needed to conserve 1,000 mature individuals (or the total population if smaller) to prevent extinction; and second, an area-based target that estimates the amount of habitat needed to sustain the long-term conservation of each species. The AOH maps were then overlaid with existing protected areas to identify those species that do not yet have their minimum conservation targets met. Using this approach, we identified 10 species that require additional protection to avoid extinction, and a further 54 species that need expanded protection for sustained conservation. Fortunately, the majority of species already met their target. We also ran a prioritization analysis to identify and map the places most important for meeting the goals of the under-protected species. We found that just 661.4 km2 is needed to meet population-based targets for the ten species of greatest concern, and 16,360 km2 is needed to meet area-based targets for all under-protected species combined. These areas represent <0.1% of the regions land area and are mostly concentrated in five countries (Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil).

Historically, research has prioritized protists associated with animals and plants, particularly those of medical significance, thereby overlooking the majority of protist diversity. Conventional molecular methods, such as 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, frequently encounter limitations, including primer binding bias and PCR bias caused by gene length variations, creating a biased perspective of understudied protistan diversity. Further, most protist lineages are notoriously difficult to cultivate. Here, we apply a cultivation-independent approach in which we analyzed over 30,000 assembled metagenomes and protist single cell genomes and 21 long 18S rRNA gene amplicon data sets from various global ecosystems, including marine, freshwater, and soil environments. We recovered 157,956 18S rRNA gene sequences ([&ge;]800 bp), which clustered into 103,338 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence identity and 24,438 OTUs at 85% identity. Notably, 69% of 13,238 non-singleton clusters at 85% identity consisted exclusively of environmental sequences, uncovering a wealth of yet uncultivated and unclassified novel protist diversity. A comprehensive taxonomic framework of eukaryotes based on concatenated 18S and 28S rRNA genes that incorporated most novel lineages revealed substantial underrepresentation of Amoebozoa, Discoba, and Rhizaria in reference databases, with many lacking isolate or genome sequence representation. Further, we identified 13 eukaryotic lineages with novelty on higher taxonomic ranks, such as class and phylum-level, that lack representation in public databases. The corresponding 85% OTUs were primarily affiliated with Excavata, with some branching closely to the root of the eukaryotic tree. Comprehensive analysis of the global distribution of eukaryotes revealed uneven microbial eukaryotic diversity across supergroups and ecosystems, with notable novelty particularly in soil and marine environments. We then examined co-occurrence between protists and prokaryotes, predicting putative symbiotic or predator-prey relationships, particularly among understudied protist groups with bacteria such as Verrucomicrobia and Rickettsiales. Our results substantially enhance the understanding of protistan diversity and distribution, revealing taxonomic blind spots and laying groundwork for future studies of these organisms ecological roles.",NA,biorxiv

However, they face numerous challenges, including pathogens that threaten their survival and ecosystem services. Among these pathogens, Nosema ceranae, a microsporidian parasite, causes significant damage to the intestinal tract and induces energetic imbalances in an organism, posing a major threat to both individual bees and entire colonies. In response to infections, bees often engage in behavioural defenses, such as selecting foods with higher antibiotic properties. We hypothesized that bees infected with N. ceranae might compensate behaviourally by increasing their carbohydrate consumption. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a meta-analysis of existing studies comparing sugar consumption in healthy and infected bees, complemented by an experimental study. In our experiment, we measured sugar intake and quantified trehalose levels in the hemolymph, a key indicator of energy reserves. Both the meta-analysis and experimental results consistently showed no significant differences in sugar consumption between healthy and infected bees. Similarly, trehalose levels in the hemolymph remained comparable between the two groups. Our findings suggest that the infection caused by N. ceranae does not elicit compensatory feeding behavior in honeybees. Moreover, the meta-analysis revealed significant gaps in current research, particularly a lack of studies focusing on forager bees, which face the highest energetic demands among colony members. Our findings call for future studies on the energetic effects of nosemosis and studies conducted under natural or semi-natural conditions.",NA,biorxiv

Currently, an over-whelming number of MR studies purport to show causal relationships among a wide range of risk factors and outcomes. Here, we find that naive application of many recently proposed MR approaches results in numerous null relationships being discovered as highly significant. We show that a well-controlled error rate can be achieved through a graphical inference approach which: (i) selects a set of genetic instrumental variables (IVs) from GWAS summary static controlling for LD, linkage and pleiotropy; (ii) accommodates rare variants and binary outcomes in a principled way; (iii) distinguishes direct from indirect risk factors in very high-dimensional data; and (iv) identifies potential unobserved latent confounding. Only 20 minutes of wall-clock compute time is required for our Causal Inference GWAS (CI-GWAS) approach to jointly analyze a set of 9 common health risk factors, four common complex metabolic disease outcomes and 8.4M genetic variants recorded for 458,747 individuals in the UK Biobank. Genome-wide, we find that very few genetic variants are suitable MR IVs, with only 696 variants remaining when analyzing all traits jointly. While we replicate almost all paths previously found by CAUSE between risk factors and outcomes, we show that only few of these reflect direct adjacencies and that many cannot be distinguished from unmeasured confounding within the UK Biobank data. Our results suggest that well-curated longitudinal records and family data are likely needed to overcome the mixtures of temporal precedence and reverse-causality in biobank data. Our approach provides a first-step toward robust principled screening for potential causal links to understand the underlying nature of phenotypic correlations in biobank data.",NA,biorxiv

ResultsWe present a multi-step, multidimensional algorithm to accurately program LED lights. This algorithm accounts for non-linearity between intensity settings and irradiance output, as well as bleedthrough between channels of different wavebands. Our algorithm out-performs other methods which treat waveband channels as independent variables, predicting intensity settings more accurately.

So far, little is known about herbivore counter-adaptations to physical plant defences and their underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigated how specialised Heliconiini caterpillars are able to cope with the hooked trichomes of Passiflora adenopoda vines. P. adenopoda trichomes have sharp tips reinforced with silica, in contrast to simpler trichomes of other Passiflora that do not deter Heliconiini larvae. While Heliconius melpomene and H. erato caterpillars placed on P. adenopoda leaves were arrested and their soft cuticle was pierced by the sharp hooked trichomes, H. charithonia and Dryas iulia caterpillars of all sizes could move easily over the leaves without any injury. The superior performance of these two species on trichome-bearing leaves can be explained by their thicker and more puncture-resistant cuticle. Morphological and penetrometry measurements showed that the relevant cuticle regions in H. charithonia and D. iulia caterpillars are significantly thicker and more puncture-resistant than in H. melpomene and H. erato. When we tested the ability of the caterpillars to feed on P. adenopoda leaves with hooked trichomes, only H. charithonia survived, indicating the existence of further, previously unknown post-ingestive adaptations.

Here we report both ""viral fossils"" and active infection by giant viruses in fungi, particularly in the zoosporic phyla Blastocladiomycota and Chytridiomycota.

We observed variation in infection status among the isolates including apparent active infection and transcriptionally-suppressed states, suggesting that viral activation may be constrained to certain life stages of the host. Our experimental findings add to the limited natural virus-host systems available in culture for the study of giant viruses. These viruses may have shaped the early evolution of these fungal lineages by the shuttling of genes between major kingdoms and domains of life.

Advances in stem cell biology in the last decade introduced organoids as model to study organogenesis under normal and diseased conditions. However, even though strikingly similar at some points, it remained elusive to which extend the generation of individual structural features in organoids recapitulates in vivo organogenesis. Here we describe the generation of fish ocular organoids composed of both, lens and retina, using pluripotent embryonic cells from medaka (Oryzias latipes). Formation of the organoid lens followed the key molecular features of the process in vivo, including the establishment of lens progenitor cells and their subsequent differentiation into lens fiber cells. In a process dependent on the coordinated activity of BMP and FGF signaling, lens formation in ocular organoids was marked by the expression of key genes implicated in organismal lens development. Despite adhering to the basic molecular machinery of lens formation in vivo, the morphogenesis into a spherical lens followed an ""inside-out"" mode. Lens progenitor cells were initially established and differentiated into a spherical lens directly inside of the retina. Subsequent displacement of the lens from the center of the organoid towards its surface ultimately led to the formation of a cup-shaped retina with a centrally positioned lens. Our study highlights that the self-organization of the organoid can favor routes that were not selected for in the developing embryo. Those routes can lead to an alternative, though highly similar outcome with the respect to achieving specific structural features in an unconstrained, embryo-free environment.",NA,biorxiv

Yet, for many pathogens we know exceptionally little about their epidemiological and population dynamics, and this knowledge gap is slowing the development of efficient control strategies. Here we study the population genomics and molecular epidemiology of wheat powdery mildew, a disease caused by the biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici (Bgt). We sampled Bgt for two consecutive years, 2022 and 2023, from 22 countries in Europe and surrounding regions, and compiled a genomic dataset of 415 Bgt isolates. We found one single epidemic unit in the north of Europe, consisting of a highly homogeneous population. Conversely, the south of Europe hosts smaller local populations which are less interconnected. In addition, we show that the population structure can be largely predicted by the prevalent wind patterns. We identified several loci that were under selection in the recent past, including fungicide targets and avirulence genes. Some of these loci are common between populations, while others are not, suggesting different local selective pressures. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of one of these loci, AvrPm17, coding for an effector recognized by the wheat receptor Pm17. We found evidence for a soft sweep on standing genetic variation. Multiple AvrPm17 haplotypes, which can partially escape recognition by Pm17, spread rapidly throughout the continent upon its introduction in the early 2000s. We also identified a new virulent variant, which emerged more recently and can evade Pm17 resistance altogether. Overall, we highlight the potential of genomic surveillance in resolving the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of agricultural pathogens, as well as in guiding control strategies.",NA,biorxiv

Lysosomes participate in Ca2+ homeostasis by mobilising Ca2+ in response to Nicotinic Acid Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NAADP). We postulate that both downstream activation of Ca2+ sensitive AC (AC1 and AC8) and lysosomal Ca2+ signalling in response to IP3R activation contribute to atrial myocyte function and pacemaking. Ectopic application of phenylephrine (PE) increased chronotropy and inotropy and this response was reduced in the presence of NAADP pathway inhibitors (BZ-194 and SAN4825) and Bafilomycin A1. PE increased cyclic adenosine 3-5 monophosphate (cAMP) activity in neonatal rat atrial myocytes (NRAMs) and this was inhibited by NAADP pathway inhibitors. This inhibition was not observed in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), revealing specificity of this response to NRAMs. We investigated expression of AC1 and AC8 as a possible explanation to these observations. Genetic perturbation of AC1 and AC8 by double-knockout of Adcy1 and Adcy8 in a mouse model showed a decrease in positive chronotropic and inotropic response upon cumulative dose of PE in atrial tissue, reduced PE stimulated amplitude of Ca2+ transient in isolated atrial myocytes and presented decreased cytosolic cAMP levels in response to PE in neonatal atrial myocytes that was not inhibited by NAADP pathway inhibitors.

While antibodies targeting the 65 kDa isoform of GAD are of high diagnostic value, T cell mediated cytotoxicity has been identified as a key component of disease pathogenesis. The precise pathophysiological mechanisms by which the disease is triggered and maintained, however, remain incompletely understood.

MethodsWe performed single-cell transcriptome and immune repertoire sequencing (sc-seq) in CSF and blood of 8 anti-GAD65 AINS patients compared to 8 non-inflammatory controls. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were synthesized from B cell receptor (BCR) data to evaluate the B cellular immune response.

FindingsWe identified an increase and expansion of activated CD4+ stem cell-like memory T cells (TSCM) in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients. Expanded T cells showed increased expression of proinflammatory genes. The mAb analysis revealed a high frequency of GAD65-reactive BCRs in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients with increased somatic hypermutations compared to non-GAD-reactive BCRs and BCRs from controls.

ConclusionsSc-seq identified clonally expanded CD4+ TSCM in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients harboring cytotoxic properties likely contributing to disease pathogenesis. GAD-reactive B cells circulate in the CSF of anti-GAD65 AINS patients further supporting the concept of an antigen-specific intrathecal immune response. Future studies need to clarify the actual pathogenicity of these immune cells and the link between T and B cellular immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of anti-GAD65 AINS.

Employing a human IGHV4-59/IGKV3-20 public antibody as a model, we compare SHM signatures in antibodies also using these V genes, but recognizing other epitopes. Critically, this comparison identified clonotype-enriched mutations in the light chain. Our analyses also show that these SHMs, in combination, enhance binding to a previously uncharacterized viral epitope, with antibody responses to it increasing after multiple vaccinations.

Current prognostic methods are epithelium-centric, overlooking the complex cellular landscape within the tumour microenvironment (TME), which remains incompletely characterised. We performed a comprehensive analysis of cancerous and adjacent-benign cores from 24 patients with hormone therapy-naive localised PCa using single-cell RNA-sequencing. By integrating copy number variation and transcriptional signatures, we classified epithelial cells across a malignant spectrum, revealing widespread molecular perturbation. We found an expansion of Club cell phenotypes, suggestive of Luminal dedifferentiation. We also performed a detailed annotation of stromal phenotypes, focusing on fibroblasts, and identified a novel peri-neural fibroblast population. Spatial transcriptomics elucidated the precise anatomical distribution of CAFs within the PCa TME. This study provides a valuable foundation for advancing our understanding of PCa pathobiology and developing a comprehensive cellular model of the disease.

This study investigates how task demand and an OR soundscape including irrelevant speech, influence perceived work-load, surgical performance, and auditory processing in a simulated surgical environment, using mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Participants performed two simulated surgical tasks, namely peg transfer and suturing, representing a low-demand and high-demand task, respectively. The tasks were performed under two sound conditions: An OR soundscape was presented with irrelevant speech or alone. Neural responses to transient and continuous auditory stimuli were analyzed using event-related potentials (ERPs) and temporal response functions (TRFs), respectively. Results showed that irrelevant speech increased self-reported workload and distraction. EEG analyses revealed reduced neural responses to transient sounds and irrelevant speech under high task demand, reflecting early-stage sensory filtering of auditory distractions. Notably, an inverse relationship was observed between neural responses to speech and self-reported workload, indicating that the speech responses may serve as a marker for perceived workload. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of EEG to assess irrelevant sound processing in realistic work-like settings and highlights the critical role of task demand in modulating neural responses and self-reported workload to soundscapes.",NA,biorxiv

This heteromeric complex comprises the catalytic subunit DHDDS and the regulatory Nogo-B receptor (NgBR). Although NgBR dramatically enhances DHDDS activity, the molecular basis for this allosteric regulation remains unclear. Here, we combined crystallography, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), molecular dynamics simulations, and network analysis to uncover the structural dynamics and communication pathways within hcis-PT. By solving the apo structure of hcis-PT, we reveal only a localized flexibility at the active site and the NgBR C-terminus. However, HDX-MS demonstrated widespread substrate-induced stabilization, particularly at the NgBR {beta}D-{beta}E loop, highlighting it as an allosteric hub. Functional mutagenesis scanning identified NgBRS249 as critical for enzymatic activity, independent of structural perturbations. Network analysis of MD simulations pinpointed this residue as a central node in inter-subunit communication, with perturbations disrupting downstream allosteric pathways, altering enzymatic activity. Our findings reveal a dynamic regulatory network centered at the inter-subunit interface, wherein specific NgBR residues modulate DHDDS activity through allosteric signaling.

Symptoms are characterized by a dystonia-parkinsonism. Recently, experimental studies have shown that the pathophysiology of the disease is based on a combined dysfunction of the cerebellum (CB) and basal ganglia (BG) and that blocking their interaction can alleviate the symptoms. The underlying network mechanisms have not been studied so far.

ObjectiveOur aim was to characterize neuronal network activity in the BG and CB and motor cortex in the ouabain model of RDP by site-specific infusion of ouabain.

MethodsRats were chronically infused with ouabain either in the CB, striatum (STR) or at both places simultaneously. Motor behavior was scored using published rating systems. Parallel in vivo recordings of local field potentials (LFP) from M1, deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) were performed. Data were compared to untreated controls.

ResultsOuabain infusion into the cerebellum produced severe dystonia that was associated with increased high-frequency gamma oscillations in the DCNs, which were subsequently transmitted to the BG and M1. Striatal infusion led to parkinsonism and elevated beta- oscillations in SNr that were transmitted to the CB and M1. The simultaneous application of STRs and CB with ouabain resulted in dystonia-parkinsonism and increased beta oscillations in BG, CB, and M1.

ConclusionWe demonstrate that symptom-specific beta and gamma oscillations can be transmitted between the BG and CB, which is likely to be very important for the understanding of disease mechanisms.",NA,biorxiv

By devising a memory-efficient implementation, we first demonstrate URFs capability to learn important sets of inter-residue features of a protein and subsequently to resolve its complex conformational landscape, performing at par or surpassing its traditional supervised counterpart and 15 other leading baseline methods. Crucially, URF is supplemented by an internal metric, the learning coefficient, which automates the process of hyper-parameter optimization, making the method robust and user-friendly. URFs remarkable ability to learn important protein features in an unbiased fashion was validated against 10 independent protein systems including both both folded and intrinsically disordered states. In particular, benchmarking investigations showed that the protein representations identified by URF are functionally meaningful in comparison to current state-of-the-art deep learning methods. As an application, we show that URF can be seamlessly integrated with downstream analyses pipeline such as Markov state models to attain better resolved outputs.

However, little is known about the physiological basis for this function. Here we show that the thermal properties of skin are highly reactive to diet: within three days, a high fat diet reduces heat transfer through skin. In contrast, a dietary manipulation that prevents obesity accelerates energy loss through skins. We found that skin was the largest target in a mouse body for dietary fat delivery, and that dietary triglyceride was assimilated both by epidermis and by dermal white adipose tissue. Skin from mice calorie-restricted for 3 weeks did not take up circulating lipids and showed a highly depleted stratum corneum. Dietary triglyceride acyl groups persist in skin for weeks after feeding. Using multi-modal lipid profiling, we have implicated both keratinocytes and sebocytes in the altered lipids which correlate with thermal function. In response to high fat feeding, wax diesters and ceramides accumulate, and triglycerides become more saturated. In contrast, in response to the dramatic loss of adipose tissue that accompanies restriction of the branched chain amino acid isoleucine, skin becomes more heat-permeable, resisting changes induced by Western diet feeding, with a signature of depleted signaling lipids. We propose that skin should be routinely included in physiological studies of lipid metabolism, given the size of the skin lipid reservoir and its adaptable functionality.",NA,biorxiv

Retinotopic mapping has identified a large number of systematic maps of the visual field, while category-selectivity mapping has identified clusters of neural populations that reliably respond more strongly to specific image categories such as objects, faces, scenes and body parts compared to other categories. While early investigations seemed to suggest that these two organizing principles were largely separated in the brain, with retinotopic maps in posterior visual cortex and category-selective regions in anterior visual cortex, recent work shows that category-selective regions overlap with retinotopic maps, giving rise to spatial visual field biases within these regions.

Here, we collected fMRI responses whilst performing both retinotopic and category mapping within the same participants, allowing detailed comparison of neural tuning for space and category at the single voxel level. We use these data to evaluate two previous proposals of how retinotopic biases relate to category-selectivity: 1) complementary quadrant biases (upper vs. lower contralateral visual field) inherited from early visual cortex explain the presence of paired regions selective for the same category across lateral and ventral occipitotemporal cortex (lOTC, vOTC); and 2) eccentricity biases (center vs. periphery of the visual field) explain the presence of selectivity for different categories, specifically differentiating face-versus scene-selectivity within the ventral surface.

Confirming and extending previous findings for a comprehensive set of face-, scene-, object, and place-selective regions of interest, we provide robust evidence that category-selective regions do not sample visual space uniformly, exhibiting systematic biases towards either the upper or lower field (all category regions) and center vs. periphery (face vs. place regions). Consistent with 1), we find that quadrant biases differ systematically between lateral and ventral OTC, with lateral regions showing systematic lower field biases and ventral regions showing upper field biases, differentiating regions selective for the same category in terms of their spatial bias. However, contrary to 2), we find that eccentricity tuning does not strongly predict the strength of face-or scene category-selectivity in a given voxel. Specifically, highly face-selective voxels are not solely confined to the fovea, and while most scene-selective voxels show peripheral tuning, highly scene-selective voxels actually show strong foveal tuning, particularly in anterior medial-ventral cortex.

Collectively, these results demonstrate that spatial biases in category-selective cortex are widespread and robust, whilst also suggesting there is no simple relation between spatial tuning and category-selectivity.",NA,biorxiv

Envirotyping for environmental water status was applied to assist interpretation of GxE interactions for wheat yield in multi-environment trials conducted in drought-prone Australian environments. Genotypes from a multi-reference parent nested association mapping (MR-NAM) population were tested in 10 trials across the Australian wheatbelt. Genotype yield and phenology were measured in all trials, while traits associated with the stay-green phenotype were assessed for a subset of 5 trials. Envirotyping was conducted by characterizing water stress experienced by genotypes at each trial using crop modelling. Envirotyping facilitated the understanding of GxE interactions by explaining 75, 67, and 66% of the genotypic variance for yield in severe water-limited (ET3), mild terminal water-stress (ET2), and water-sufficient (ET1) environments, respectively.

Yield and stay-green were negatively correlated with flowering time in most trials. However, when focusing on genotypes flowering at similar times within a trial, no significant correlation was found between yield and flowering. Importantly stay-green traits remained significantly correlated with yield. Stay-green traits such as delayed onset of senescence and slower senescence rate benefited yield by 0.2 to 1.1 t ha-1 across environments, highlighting the breeding potential for stay-green traits in both water-sufficient and water-limited environments. Hence, sustaining green leaf area during grain filling helped to enhance yield. Envirotyping to better understand GxE interactions for yield, coupled with screening for traits exhibiting superior adaptive mechanisms, are powerful assets in assisting plant breeders to select more effectively drought adapted genotypes.

HighlightsGenotype x environment interaction for yield could be reduced with envirotyping.
Envirotyping enabled a 75% gain in genotypic variance in severe drought conditions.
Envirotyping clarified breeding potential of stay-green traits across environments.

The PSII mutants were investigated using EPR spectroscopy, thermoluminescence, (time-resolved) absorption changes measurements, and oximetry. While the mutation had minor effects in PsbA1-PSII, the S264V mutation in PsbA3-PSII had significant consequences: i) thermoluminescence data show inefficient electron transfer from QA- to QB; ii) re-oxidation of QA- was slowed, by at least a factor of 10; iii) the herbicides inhibit weakly O2 evolution; iv) no Fe2+QB- EPR signal was detected in dark-adapted PSII; instead, v) a large Fe3+ signal was present with vi) modified EPR properties; vii) no QA-Fe2+QB- biradical signal was observed after illumination at 198 K following a flash illumination, confirming the inefficient formation of QB-; viii) either no proton uptake coupled to non-heme iron reduction occurred or with a very slow rate compared to PsbA3-PSII; ix) changes were noted in the electrochromic response associated with QA- formation; and x) increased production of singlet oxygen, both with and without herbicides.

This study investigated this question in the context of human spatial navigation by combining high-field 3T fMRI and desktop virtual reality. Participants encoded and retrieved spatial locations using either landmarks alone (landmark condition), visual self-motion cues alone (i.e., optic flow; self-motion condition), or both cues together (combination condition). Participants behaviorally benefited from cue integration. fMRI analyses revealed a cue integration effect in the hippocampus, which displayed positional coding only in the combination condition, and only in participants who showed behavioral benefits from cue integration. Furthermore, hippocampal positional coding was more strongly associated with actual than self-reported locations, indicating it integrates sensory-perceptual inputs from spatial cues. Our findings suggest that the hippocampuss fundamental function is to integrate diverse sensory-perceptual inputs to support precise memory-guided navigation, rather than representing space per se, thereby challenging the dominant cognitive map theory in spatial navigation. Our findings also offers a unifying framework for understanding the hippocampal function in cue integration, episodic memory, and relational memory.

Significance StatementThe hippocampus is traditionally viewed as a cognitive map that represents spatial environments. However, our findings challenge this longstanding view by demonstrating that hippocampal involvement in spatial navigation lies in the integration of multiple sensory-perceptual inputs to enhance the precision of spatial representations, rather than spatial representation per se. Using high-resolution fMRI and a novel immersive virtual navigation task, we showed that positional coding in the hippocampus emerges only in participants who successfully integrated different spatial cues. Our findings also offers a unifying framework for understanding the hippocampal function across domains, including spatial navigation, cue integration, episodic memory, and relational memory.",NA,biorxiv

An example found in protists and plants is the modification of serine and threonine residues of dozens to hundreds of nucleocytoplasmic proteins with a single fucose (O-Fuc). A nucleocytoplasmic O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) occurs in the pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, the social amoeba Dictyostelium, and higher plants, where it is called Spy because mutants have a spindly appearance. O-fucosylation, which is required for optimal proliferation of Toxoplasma and Dictyostelium, is paralogous to the O-GlcNAcylation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins of plants and animals that is involved in stress and nutritional responses. O-Fuc was first discovered in Toxoplasma using Aleuria aurantia lectin, but its broad specificity for terminal fucose residues on N- and O-linked glycans in the secretory pathway limits its use. Here we present affinity purified rabbit antisera that are selective for the detection and enrichment of proteins bearing fucose-O-Ser or fucose-O-Thr. These antibodies detect numerous nucleocytoplasmic proteins in Toxoplasma, Dictyostelium, and Arabidopsis, as well as O-Fuc occurring on secretory proteins of Dictyostelium and mammalian cells, although the latter are frequently blocked by further glycosylation. The antibodies label Toxoplasma, Acanthamoeba, and Dictyostelium in a pattern reminiscent of O-GlcNAc in animal cells including nuclear pores. The O-fucome of Dictyostelium is partially conserved with that of Toxoplasma and is highly induced during starvation-induced development. These antisera demonstrate the unique antigenicity of O-Fuc, document conservation of the O-fucome among unrelated protists, and will enable the study of the O-fucomes of other organisms possessing OFT-like genes.

IMPORTANCEO-fucose, a form of mono-glycosylation on serine and threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins of some parasites, other unicellular eukaryotes, and plants, is understudied because it is difficult to detect owing to its neutral charge and lability during mass spectrometry. Yet the O-fucosyltransferase enzyme (OFT) is required for optimal growth of the agent for toxoplasmosis, Toxoplasma gondii, and an unrelated protist, the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Furthermore, O-fucosylation is closely related to the analogous process of O-GlcNAcylation of thousands of proteins of animal cells, where it plays a central role in stress and nutritional responses. O-Fuc is currently best detected using Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL), but in most organisms AAL also recognizes a multitude of proteins in the secretory pathway that are modified with fucose in different ways. By establishing the potential to induce highly specific rabbit antisera that discriminate O-Fuc from all other forms of protein fucosylation, this study expands knowledge about the protist O-fucome and opens a gateway to explore the potential occurrence and roles of this intriguing posttranslational modification in bacteria and other protist pathogens such as Acanthamoeba castellanii.",NA,biorxiv

A crucial step of the scaffolding process is the way in which details of a new episode are connected to an existing schema, forming a robust memory representation that can be easily accessed in the future. A unique testbed for studying this binding process is a mnemonic technique called the Method of Loci (MoL), in which people meaningfully connect items to be remembered with a well-learned list of imagined loci. We collected fMRI data from participants in 3 longitudinal sessions while they were enrolled in a month-long MoL training course, all of whom showed dramatic improvements in their ability to remember lists of 20 or 40 words. We obtained neural patterns when the loci and objects are presented by themselves, when they are combined into an integrated representation at encoding, and when the integrated representation was subsequently retrieved, as well as verbal descriptions from the participants about the way they associated each item to each locus. We found that in default mode network regions, including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the combined representations of loci and items are highly conjunctive: the unified locus-item representation was substantially different from a linear combination of the isolated locus and item representation, reflecting the addition of new integrative details specific to each combined pair. The conjunctive component of the representation reflected the particular creative details generated by individual participants and increased over time as participants gained expertise in MoL. Our findings reveal a critical role for the default mode network in creating meaningful connections between new information and well-learned schematic contexts.",NA,biorxiv

With the advent of fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) and other technological advances in microscopy techniques, much more is now known about how the filamentous actin (F-actin) and microtubule (MT) networks work within cells to give rise to the vast array of functions which require them. A current challenge to the imaging field is to improve the utility and accuracy of the computational approaches required to analyze large and complex imaging datasets. Here, we present the results of a computational method that, when applied to FSM time-lapse series, can capture the instantaneous state of the rapidly changing, dense, and multi-directional speckle flows often exhibited by cytoskeletal dynamics in living systems. Re-analysis of previously published FSM image sets demonstrates that this method, which we call the Instantaneous Flow Tracking Algorithm (IFTA), can accurately detect speckle flows in mitotic spindles and F-actin meshworks, even in regions of high dynamicity of overlapping, anti-parallel flows where previous methods failed.

MethodsThe anti-parallel flow at the metaphase plate of the mitotic spindle is a well-known phenomenon during the initial stages of chromosome segregation and it has been measured by several approaches, mostly in stationary spindles which do not exhibit any polar rotation. The mitotic spindle is the target of many cancer and neurodegenerative drugs and as such, there has been many attempts at inhibiting its basic functions with the objective of preventing chromosome segregation and the formation of new daughter cells. Such attempts have largely been focused on the inhibition of the action of MT plus-end directed motors, for instance the kinesin KIF11. Spindles with inhibited kinesins have been thought to exhibit no MT flux, however IFTA measured regional flux of up to 2.7 {micro}m/min, which reveals the activity of potent secondary flux mechanisms. These results suggest novel, additional, approaches toward arresting cells in mitosis during patient treatment.

ResultsThe traditional tracking methods erroneously measure zero flux in areas where contractile F-actin flows meet, denoted as a ""convergence zone"" and commonly found in the lamella of motile cells and the neck of growth cones. When IFTA was used to analyze FSM datasets derived from these structures, we detected high rates of protein turnover, anti-parallel speckle motion, and fast flux of actin subunits in both directions in the same ""convergence zones"". This demonstrates the presence of a molecular machinery based on contractility in the lamella/lamellipodium of migrating cells and at the base of growing neurons, which can be exploited in the clinic. When applied to FSM data of migrating kangaroo rat kidney epithelial PtK1 cells overexpressing different isoforms of the actin-based motor tropomyosin, IFTA revealed distinct, isoform-specific effects on contractile F-actin flows. Specifically, we found that decreased affinity between tropomyosin and F-actin correlated with an increase in speckle velocity heterogeneity.

ConclusionsSuch quantitative imaging analysis offers the ability to reliably test novel therapeutics ex vivo.

Significance statementThe main discoveries presented in the manuscript are related to the ability of the cell to adapt to a range of biochemical and mechanical perturbations. As cell therapy is becoming the forefront of precision medicine, it would be critical to anticipate the mechanisms of action of engineered immune cells. The pathways activated during therapy can be pinpointed by measuring its effects on the target proteins in patient-derived living cells. The clinical application of the approach outlined in this manuscript pertains to analyzing drug resistance in cancer therapy and the treatment of neurodegeneration. Our hypothesis is that targeting actin in resistant tumors could sensitize cancer cells to tubulin inhibitors. If this proves true, it will have implications in the clinic.",NA,biorxiv

These sequences (called ""songs"") are some of the most structurally and acoustically complex vocal patterns produced by any mammal. Humpback whale song production is highly dynamic in that individuals constantly modify the properties of songs across multiple time scales throughout their adult lives. Past analyses of co-vocalizing humpback whales suggest that singers within earshot of one another may dynamically and interactively adjust their vocalizations in reaction to what they hear. The current study investigated whether singing humpback whales coordinate their production of overlapping sound patterns either by modulating how long they produce similar patterns or by dynamically adjusting the spectral properties of individual sounds and/or sound sequences. Our results show that the vocal adjustments singing humpback whales make when singing in dyads are diverse and appear to depend on the acoustic context. These findings confirm that individual singers flexibly adjust song features in real-time. When pairs of singers adjust song content, they do so in ways that may increase or decrease the acoustic similarity of concurrent sound patterns. No evidence was found of singers adjusting the number or timing of sound pattern repetitions to alter pattern overlap. However, most singers modified how they produced units after a second singer began singing. The current results suggest that co-singing humpback whales attend to the vocal actions of other audible singers and may sometimes modulate song content to initiate social interactions from long distances. Understanding how singing whales vocally interact can clarify the relevance of singing in coordinating vertebrate behavior.",NA,biorxiv

Methadone blocks several ionic currents with different half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50), including the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr), the inward rectifier potassium current (IK1), the L-type calcium current (ICa,L), and the late component of the sodium current (INaL). Despite the well-known proarrhythmic effect of IKr blockade, the effects of blocking other ionic currents on arrhythmogenesis remain less well understood.

MethodsComputer simulations were used to explore the proarrhythmic effects of methadone by investigating how its blocking effects on ionic currents act alone or together in arrhythmogenesis.

ResultsThe major findings are: 1) blocking IK1 potentiates QT prolongation-related arrhythmogenesis by enhancing a tissue-scale dynamical instability for the spontaneous genesis of ectopic excitations. Blocking IK1 and IKr together results in a synergistic effect, greatly increasing the arrhythmia propensity, much larger than that of blocking either one alone; 2) blocking IK1 in combination with lowering ICa,L potentiates phase-2 reentry caused by spike-and-dome action potential morphology, an arrhythmia mechanism of Brugada syndrome. Blocking IKr exhibits little effect for this mechanism of arrhythmias; and 3) hypoxia, often comorbid in methadone populations, can potentiate QT prolongation-related arrhythmias at high sympathetic activity and phase-2 reentry at low or basal sympathetic activity, mainly via its effect on ICa,L.

ConclusionsThese simulation results provide mechanistic insights into the genesis of QT prolongation-related Torsades de Pointes and Brugada-like ECG related arrhythmias caused by methadone use.",NA,biorxiv

This study investigated the vasodilatory action of tofogliflozin using rabbit femoral artery rings pre-contracted with phenylephrine.

APPROACH AND RESULTSThe femoral artery quickly separated from the rabbit and fix it to the organ bath chamber. Subsequently, administer an inhibitor that modulates vascular tension in the rings or remove the endothelium to assess its impact on vasodilation. The results showed the concentration-dependent induction of vasodilation by tofogliflozin, a response that remained unchanged following endothelial removal, pretreatment with the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME, or the inhibition of low- and intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SKCa and IKCa) using apamin in combination with TRAM-34. Furthermore, pretreatment with the voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channel inhibitor 4-AP reduced the vasodilatory effects of tofogliflozin whereas pretreatment with the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel inhibitor glibenclamide or the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channel inhibitor paxilline did not. Notably, our findings indicated that Kv7.X, rather than Kv1.5 or Kv2.1, is the primary Kv subtype involved in tofogliflozin-induced vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of tofogliflozin were also significantly inhibited in femoral arterial rings pretreated with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump inhibitors thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). Tofogliflozin-induced vasodilation was unaltered in arterial rings exposed to the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536, the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor KT 5720, and the protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor KT 582 whereas it was effectively reduced by the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor ODQ.

Using mice and organoid models, we demonstrate genetic ablation of let-7a1/let-7f1/let-7d cluster (let-7afd) in AT2 cells prevents AT1 differentiation and results in accumulation of AT2 transitional cells in progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Integration of AGO2-eCLIP with RNA-sequencing from AT2 cells uncovered the induction of direct targets of let-7 in an oncogene feed-forward regulatory network including BACH1/EZH2/MYC which drives an aberrant fibrotic cascade. Additional analyses using CUT&RUN-sequencing revealed an epigenetic role of let-7 in induction of chromatin histone acetylation and methylation and maladaptive AT2 cell reprogramming. This study identifies let-7 as a key gatekeeper of post-transcriptional and epigenetic chromatin signals to prevent AT2-driven pulmonary fibrosis.",NA,biorxiv

Using BALB/c mice deficient in platelet MyD88 (MyD88PKO) or platelet DKK1 (DKK1PKO), we assessed whether the transmission of activation signals through MyD88 and subsequent release of DKK1 are critical in regulating the immune response to L. major. At the site of infection, the levels of neutrophil platelet aggregates and activated neutrophils of MyD88(PKO) and DKK1(PKO) mice were reduced. Further, these mice mounted anti-leishmanial Th1-responses and failed to develop progressive lesions. In contrast, WT BALB/c-infected mice developed progressive disease associated with elevated IL-10-producing Th1 and Th2 T cells. Further, elevated CD206+ M2 macrophages and tolerogenic DC-10 cells, which favor parasite proliferation, were observed. In vitro, DKK1 promoted DC IL-10 production and blocked TNF-induction of IL-12. Overall, these results indicate that platelet-DKK1 promotes disease progression through the induction of tolerogenic DCs and subsequent pathological Th2 and IL-10-Th1 T cell-responses.

Summary statementPlatelet DKK1 produced in response to TLR1/2 signaling by Leishmania parasites drives development of non-healing responses. In vivo/ in vitro analyses indicate that the mechanism underlying this process is the promotion of tolerogenic dendritic cells, driving Th2 and Th1-IL-10 T cell responses.

Due to the loss of bone mass being associated with increased marrow fat, trans-differentiation of osteoblasts into adipocytes been hypothesized as a contributor to osteoporotic bone loss and fragility. Reprogramming of transcriptional networks is a prerequisite for cellular differentiation, however, to which extent cell-type specific transcriptional networks modulate cellular plasticity within stromal cells remains unknown. In this study we performed gene expression analysis at bulk and single cell level in stromal cells being repeatedly exposed to osteogenic and adipogenic inducers in vitro. Surprisingly, cell type specific gene networks are not suppressive but instead promoting to obtain an opposing phenotype, e.g., enhanced osteoblast differentiation of adipogenic pre-stimulated stromal cells compared to undifferentiated ones. This is supported by the presence of cells simultaneously showing an osteogenic and adipogenic phenotype highlighting a strong molecular plasticity of transcriptional networks in stromal cells. These observations provide a strong molecular support for the notion of not only progenitor speciation but also the plasticity of differentiated cells contributing to the balance of bone mass and marrow fat content.

SummaryWe provide mechanistic evidence, that cells with established lineage-selective gene programs are more vulnerable to obtain gene signatures and phenotypes of opposing lineages, building ground for trans-differentiation between osteoblasts and adipocytes being a coordinated process rather than random and misdirected.",NA,biorxiv

Recent studies have also indicated a role for caspases in AD-related synaptic dysfunction and memory loss, but the mechanism(s) through which the caspases act remains elusive. Previous studies in cell culture indicate that cleavage of a caspase site on the intracellular domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) protein contributes to A{beta}-induced cell death. However, the role of this cleavage event in synaptic dysfunction has not been established.

METHODSThrough a combination of intracellular and extracellular electrophysiological methods and confocal microscopy of dendritic spines, we examined the involvement of caspase-3 and amyloid-precursor protein in A{beta}-mediated synaptic dysfunction.

RESULTSHere, we provide evidence that caspase activity at the intracellular domain of APP is required for acute A{beta}-induced depression of glutamatergic synapses. We find that local elevation of A{beta} levels through over-expression of the C-terminal fragment of APP (C99) failed to depress synapses if caspases were inhibited pharmacologically or in tissue lacking caspase-3. To demonstrate a link between these findings to APP, we found that A{beta} failed to depress synaptic transmission or inhibit synaptic plasticity in neurons lacking APP. To specifically test the role of caspase cleavage of the intracellular domain of APP, we introduced a mutation that inhibits caspase cleavage at site 664 to the C99 construct; this construct produced A{beta} but failed to elicit A{beta}-induced synaptic depression or spine loss, and reduced caspase-3 activity.

CONCLUSIONTaken together, these results suggest an APP-dependent pathway in which caspases contribute to A{beta}-induced synaptic depression and spine loss via cleavage of APP.",NA,biorxiv

This chemical diversity primarily arises from glycosylation, where sugars are selectively added to the flavonol backbone. While flavonol profiles vary across species and organs, the evolutionary forces shaping this chemodiversity and the physiological significance of specific glycosides remain a mystery. Here, we reveal that finely tuned transcriptional regulation and the sugar selectivity of glycosyltransferases drive the formation of distinct organ specific flavonol profiles and a specific flavonol is necessary for male fertility. In Solanaceae pollen, two flavonol glycosides, K2 (kaempferol 3-O-glucosyl(1 [-&gt;] 2)galactoside) and Q2 (quercetin 3-O-glucosyl(1 [-&gt;] 2)galactoside), are exclusively accumulated. K2 is evolutionarily conserved, while Q2 was lost over time. Consistently, K2 is essential for male fertility, whereas Q2 and aglycones fail to rescue fertility defects.

While signals from the stroma have been shown to regulate nephron progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation, much less is known about regulation of the stromal progenitor population. Here, we demonstrate that disruption of the NPC lineage via loss of Wt1 (i.e., Six2cre;Wt1c/c) results in an expansion of Foxd1+ stromal progenitor cells. Analyses of the developing stroma in two additional models, including Wnt4-null mutants (which fail to form nephron structures similar to Six2cre;Wt1c/c kidneys) and NPC ablation via diphtheria toxin (i.e., Six2cre;RosaDTAc/+), both phenocopy Six2cre;Wt1c/c mutants, thus further confirming that defects in the NPC lineage result in abnormal development of the stromal progenitor population.

Studies in rodents have shown that glial reactivity occurs within 24 hour of high-fat diet (HFD) consumption, long before obesity development, and takes place mainly in the hypothalamus (HT), a crucial brain structure for controlling body weight. Understanding more precisely the kinetics of glial activation of two major brain cells (astrocytes and microglia) and their impact on eating behavior could prevent obesity and offer new prospects for therapeutic treatments. To understand the mechanisms pertaining to obesity-related neuroinflammation, we developed a fully automated algorithm, NutriMorph. Although some algorithms were developed in the past decade to detect and segment cells, they are highly specific, not fully automatic, and do not provide the desired morphological analysis. Our algorithm cope with these issues and performs the analysis of cells images (here, microglia of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus), and the morphological clustering of these cells through statistical analysis and machine learning. Using the k-Means algorithm, it clusters the microglia of the control condition (healthy mice) and the different states of neuroinflammation induced by high-fat diets (obese mice) into subpopulations. This paper is an extension and re-analysis of a first published paper showing that microglial reactivity can already be seen after few hours of high-fat diet (Cansell et al., 2021).

Additionally, lentiviral delivery requires high biosafety levels. To address this challenge, we have developed a two-step strategy that supports CRISPR-Cas9 through lentivirus and murine ecotropic {gamma}-retrovirus.

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a hormone primarily produced in the placenta in utero and is an important regulator of various developmental pathways including those in heart and liver. Embryonic disruptions in these developmental pathways can lead to lifelong changes and are often associated with chronic disease. Further, the placenta has sex-specific impacts on offspring development in response to hormonal changes. Previous work has shown that altered expression of Igf1 in the placenta results in sexually dimorphic changes to placental and fetal developmental outcomes. Here, mice underwent placental-targeted CRISPR manipulation for overexpression or partial knockout of Igf1. At the time of euthanasia, heart and liver tissues were collected and weighed. This dataset presents the heart and liver mass of these postnatal mice. There was a significant increase in proportional heart mass in placental Igf1 overexpression adult female mice and a trending increase in proportional liver mass in placental Igf1 overexpression adult male mice. No significant changes in heart or liver mass were seen in placental Igf1 partial knockout mice. These data provide insight into the impact of placental IGF1 on long-term heart and liver development.

VALUE OF THE DATAO_LIThere is significant evidence for the role of early genetic changes in influencing long-term health outcomes, as laid out by the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis [1]. According to this hypothesis, genetic factors may be critical in determining the timing and severity of chronic disease, with varying effects based on sex. Genetics of the placenta, which makes up the maternal-fetal interface, plays an important role in modulating exposures associated with the DOHaD hypothesis [2].
C_LIO_LIThe placenta provides essential hormones to the fetus during pregnancy [3]. Placental changes are associated with the development of chronic disease and metabolic changes [4,5]. Disruptions in placental functions have been linked to defects including congenital heart disease which affects approximately 40,000 babies each year in the United States [6,7]. The placenta is also linked to metabolic diseases later in life such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a chronic liver disease which has increased in prevalence by over 50% from 1990 to 2019 [5,8,9].
C_LIO_LIInsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a placentally produced factor that regulates pathways involved in fetal growth and development and has been shown to be critical in growth of the heart and liver [10-13]. Despite the importance of the placenta and IGF1 in heart and liver growth, specific links between placental Igf1 expression and developmental outcomes remain understudied.
C_LIO_LIPlacental function is known to have sex-specific impacts on fetal growth [14]. Further, Igf1 expression in the placenta is linked to differences in offspring developmental outcomes by sex [15]. Placental Igf1 overexpression and knockout affects offspring in a sexually dimorphic manner. IGF1 is a hormone and interacts with sex hormones, likely contributing to sex differences in response to changes in Igf1 expression [16]. Further research, including the work done to produce this dataset, may help clarify the role of placenta Igf1 expression in fetal outcomes, specifically regarding sex differences.
C_LIO_LIThe data presented in this paper provide insight into the effects of placental Insulin-like growth factor 1 overexpression and partial knockout on adult heart and liver mass. More research is needed to understand specific functional impacts on these organs. Further, understanding the effects of placental genetic changes may support the development of future treatments and therapies for placental insufficiencies.

We characterized short-term plasticity at the local excitatory synapses in layer 2/3 of the rat medial prefrontal cortex and studied its presynaptic mechanisms. Low-frequency stimulation induced slowly developing facilitation, whereas high-frequency stimulation initially induced strong depression followed by rapid facilitation. This non-monotonic delayed facilitation after a brief depression resulted from a high vesicular fusion probability and slow activation of Ca2+-dependent vesicle replenishment, which led to the overfilling of release sites beyond their basal occupancy. Pharmacological and gene knockdown (KD) experiments revealed that the facilitation was mediated by phospholipase C/diacylglycerol signaling and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7). Notably, Syt7 KD abolished facilitation and slowed the refilling rate of vesicles with high fusion probability. Furthermore, Syt7 deficiency in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons impaired the acquisition of trace fear memory and reduced c-Fos activity. In conclusion, Ca2+- and Syt7-dependent overfilling of release sites mediates synaptic facilitation at layer 2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses and contributes to temporal associative learning.",NA,biorxiv

The results reveal both known and novel degron motifs, both internal as well as at the C-terminus. Mapping the degrons onto protein structures, predicted by AlphaFold2, revealed that most of the degrons are located in buried regions, indicating that they only become active upon unfolding or misfolding.

While this phenomenon has been extensively studied in humans, more needs to be learned about its underlying neural mechanisms. This ideally requires running similar behavioral paradigms in animals. However, during neurophysiology, neurons encountered in the relevant sensory and sensory-motor brain areas for visual mislocalization can have arbitrary, non-cardinal response field locations. This necessitates using mislocalization paradigms that can work with any saccade direction. Here, we first established such a paradigm in three male rhesus macaque monkeys. In every trial, the monkeys generated a visually-guided saccade towards an eccentric target. Once a saccade onset was detected, we presented a brief flash at one of three possible locations ahead of the saccade target location. After an experimentally-imposed delay period, we removed the saccade target, and the monkeys were then required to generate a memory-guided saccade towards the remembered flash location. All three monkeys readily learned the task, and, like humans, they all showed strong backward mislocalization towards the saccade target, which recovered for later flashes from the saccade time. Importantly, we then replicated a well-known property of human perisaccadic mislocalization, as revealed by two-dimensional mislocalization paradigms: that mislocalization is strongest for upward saccades. For horizontal saccades, we additionally found stronger mislocalization for upper visual field flashes, again consistent with humans. Our results establish a robust two-dimensional mislocalization paradigm in monkeys, and they pave the way for exploring the neural mechanisms underlying the dependence of perisaccadic mislocalization strength on saccade direction.

SignificanceVisual perception is strongly altered around the time of saccades. Such alteration is often studied by characterizing how brief perisaccadic visual flashes are perceptually localized. While the properties of visual mislocalization have been exhaustively studied, the underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive, and this is due to a lack of suitable behavioral paradigms in animal models. We describe such a paradigm for macaques, which are ideal for exploring sensory-motor neural processes related to perisaccadic mislocalization.",NA,biorxiv

Mammalian cell entry complexes (Mce1-4) play an essential role for the survival of Mtb during the latent stage by mediating the import of lipids inlcudiing fatty acids and cholesterol from the host. The proper functioning of Mce-complexes requires additional proteins such as Mce-associated membrane (Mam) proteins and lipid uptake coordinator (LucA), thus making them potential candidates for the development of anti-TB drugs. Four Mam (Mam1A-1D) proteins are coded from the mce1 operon and two from the mce3 (Mam3A-3B) and mce4 (Mam4A-4B) operons. In addition, five orphaned mam (Omam) proteins have been identified which are not part of the mce operons but are functionally relevant for the Mce complexes.

Aquatic environments, in particular, can be highly sensitive to urbanization with removal of local habitat and inputs of wastewater and contaminants, leading to displacement or extinction of natural flora, fauna, and funga. Aquatic microbial communities, especially fungal communities, are extremely complex and far less characterized compared to their macro counterparts. Here, we characterized the fungal microbiome, i.e. ""mycobiome"", across multiple habitats-- water, sediment, and frog fecal matter from three species (American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus), Green frog (Lithobates clamitans), and Pickerel frog (Lithobates palustris)) -- within the Tatnuck Brook waterway in Worcester, MA. The Tatnuck Brook waterway is a connected group of streams, ponds, and lakes that transition from protected areas at its headwaters, below the citys drinking water reservoir, to highly urbanized regions within Worcester. Using metabarcode sequencing, we found that water, sediment, and frog gut habitats harbor distinct fungal communities, but all exhibit parallel shifts in diversity along an urbanization gradient. In particular, we identified fungal taxa from the amphibian mycobiome and environmental samples that exhibited a range of sensitivities to urbanization. These taxa, including Basidiobolus, Cladosporium, and Lemonniera in fecal and sediment samples, as well as Candida, which was found in all habitats, are potential indicators of shifts in aquatic ecosystems due to urbanization. Their responses to urban stressors may serve as a baseline for further studies of aquatic fungal communities.

IMPORTANCEAs cities grow, they can change nearby rivers, streams, and ponds in ways that affect plants, animals, and even tiny microbes. Fungi are an important part of these ecosystems because they help break down materials and can affect the health of animals like frogs. However, we still know very little about how fungi respond to urban environments. In this study, we looked at fungi living in water, sediment, and frog guts along a range of places from natural to highly developed areas in Worcester, Massachusetts.

To control STH-related morbidity, the World Health Organization recommends targeted deworming and improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene. Current surveillance strategies for STH focus on identifying and quantifying eggs in stool samples via microscopy, which exhibits poor specificity and sensitivity, especially in settings with low-intensity infections. Wastewater-based epidemiology is a surveillance tool used to monitor pathogen circulation and could replace stool- based approaches for STH detection. However, sampling strategies for settings lacking networked sanitation outside large urban settlements are not well developed. Here, we report evaluation of sampling strategies for soil and wastewater STH surveillance in rural and peri-urban settings without networked sanitation. We used multi-parallel qPCR assays to detect STH DNA in soil collected from high foot-traffic locations and three types of wastewater samples (passive Moore swabs, grab samples, and sediment from drainage ditches) in Come, Benin and Timiri and Jawadhu Hills in Tamil Nadu, India. We detected STH in soil (India = 32/95, Benin = 39/121) and wastewater (India = 24/60, Benin = 8/64) with a detection frequency across all sample types of 36% in India and 25% in Benin. We evaluated which sample locations and types allowed for more sensitive detection of STH DNA and determined that STH prevalence varied by sample site but did not vary significantly within a given sample site location (e.g., samples collected from multiple locations within one market). Further, we determined that wastewater sediment samples outperformed grab and Moore swab sample types for STH detection. Finally, we expanded our methods to include detection of other enteric pathogens using multiplexed qPCR for wastewater samples.

Picture a predator watching their prey sprint and screech through a field. To date, a range of multisensory algorithms have been proposed to model this process including linear and nonlinear fusion, which combine the inputs from multiple sensory channels via either a sum or nonlinear function. However, many multisensory algorithms treat successive observations independently, and so cannot leverage the temporal structure inherent to naturalistic stimuli. To investigate this, we introduce a novel multisensory task in which we provide the same number of task-relevant signals per trial but vary how this information is presented: from many short bursts to a few long sequences. We demonstrate that multisensory algorithms that treat different time steps as independent, perform sub-optimally on this task. However, simply augmenting these algorithms to integrate across sensory channels and short temporal windows allows them to perform surprisingly well, and comparably to fully recurrent neural networks. Overall, our work: highlights the benefits of fusing multisensory information across channels and time, shows that small increases in circuit/model complexity can lead to significant gains in performance, and provides a novel multisensory task for testing the relevance of this in biological systems.

1 Author summaryWe constantly detect sensory inputs, like sights and sounds, and use combinations of these signals to guide our actions. For example, by reading someones lips we can better converse with them in a noisy environment. Several mathematical models have been proposed to describe this process. However, these models are ""blind"" to time. That is, following the example above, if we took the audio and visual signals from our friend and mixed them up over time; current models would not notice any difference, but we would find the result incomprehensible. Motivated by this, we introduce a new set of models which describe how animals could fuse sensory signals across time. Surprisingly, we find that combining signals across senses and short periods of time, works as well as a more complex model.

Mutations within IDRs can disrupt their multivalent interaction networks, altering phase behavior and contributing to various diseases. Therefore, examining the evolutionary fitness of IDRs provides valuable insights into the relationship between protein sequences and phase separation. In this study, we utilized the ESM2 protein language model to map the fitness landscape of IDRs. Our findings reveal that IDRs, particularly those actively participating in phase separation, contain conserved amino acids. This conservation is evident through mutational constraints predicted by ESM2 and supported by direct analyses of multiple sequence alignments. These conserved, disordered amino acids include residues traditionally identified as ""stickers"" as well as ""spacers"" and frequently form continuous sequence motifs. The strong conservation, combined with their critical role in phase separation, suggests that these motifs act as functional units under evolutionary selection to support stable MLO formation.

However, the stability and efficiency of AD reactors are frequently challenged by microbial shifts resulting from operational disturbances. This study employs microbiome-oriented data mining and bioinformatics approaches to analyze microbial community dynamics in an anaerobic digestion reactor under steady-state operation, failure, and restoration phases. Data were extracted from a biogas plant and used to evaluate a system failure, providing crucial insights into microbial shifts associated with operational instability. A custom-built microbiome-oriented database, 2Gas, was developed to integrate sequencing data with physicochemical monitoring results, enabling structured data storage, retrieval, and correlation analysis. This database was instrumental in identifying key microbial taxa responsible for reactor destabilization and in predicting failure events based on microbial and physicochemical trends. Through high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and advanced bioinformatics analysis, microbial shifts were correlated with key operational parameters such as pH, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and ammonia concentrations. Results indicate that methanogenic archaea, particularly Methanosarcina, experienced a sharp decline during reactor failure, followed by a gradual recovery, demonstrating their sensitivity to environmental stressors. Additionally, the balance between Firmicutes and Actinobacteria was identified as a crucial determinant of reactor stability, with Firmicutes recovering in tandem with system restoration. Feedstock composition was found to play a significant role in microbial shifts, with seasonal variability influencing community composition and reactor performance. Machine learning models applied to the database suggested the potential for predictive analytics in anticipating system failures. By leveraging microbial abundance patterns, these models were able to identify early warning signs of instability. Restoration efforts, including feedstock adjustments and operational parameter optimization, successfully reinstated core microbial communities essential for biogas production. This study underscores the critical role of microbiome monitoring in anaerobic digestion and highlights the potential of bioinformatics tools for enhancing reactor resilience. Future research should focus on real-time microbiome tracking, machine learning-driven predictive maintenance, and adaptive operational strategies to further improve AD efficiency and biogas yield.",NA,biorxiv

Highly active enzymes have been designed starting from such descriptions using the generative AI method RFdiffusion [1-3], but there are two current methodological limitations. First, the geometry of the active site can only be specified at the residue level, so for each catalytic residue functional group placed around the reaction transition state, the possible locations of the residue backbone must be enumerated by building side chain rotamers back from the functional group. Second, the location of the catalytic residues along the sequence must be specified in advance, which considerably limits the space of solutions which can be sampled. Here we describe a new deep generative method, Rosetta Fold diffusion 2 (RFdiffusion2), that solves both problems, enabling enzymes to be designed from sequence agnostic descriptions of functional group locations without inverse rotamer generation. We first evaluate RFdiffusion2 on an in silico enzyme design benchmark of 41 diverse active sites and find that it is able to successfully build proteins scaffolding all 41 sites, compared to 16/41 with prior state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Next, we design enzymes around three diverse catalytic sites and characterize the designs experimentally; in each case we identify active catalysts in testing less than 96 sequences.

In this context, transcriptomic meta-analyses have proven valuable for uncovering global regulatory trends, gene co-expression networks and conserved biological responses across diverse conditions. As part of this study, 1107 public transcriptomic datasets from Illumina (631 runs) and ABI SOLID (476 runs) platforms were searched, reclassified and reanalyzed in the latest T2T genome assembly, in order to construct condition, cultivar and tissue-specific gene expression atlases associated with drought stress in grapevine. To facilitate exploration of this data, a web-based application, the Hydric Stress Atlas App (https://plantaeviz.tomsbiolab.com/vitviz/hydric_atlas/), was developed, as part of the Vitis module within the PlantaeViz platform. Together with this tool, we generated a whole-genome co-expression network using the same datasets (https://plantaeviz.tomsbiolab.com/vitviz/networks/non_agg_gcns/T2T/hydric_stress_TI/).

Using in vivo diffusion MRI and data-driven connectivity, we identify a topographic organization between the ZI and neocortex. Specifically, our methods identify a rostral-caudal gradient predominantly connecting the frontopolar and ventral prefrontal cortices with the rostral ZI, and the primary sensorimotor cortices with the caudal ZI. Moreover, we demonstrate how clustering and gradient approaches build complementary evidence including facilitating the mapping of a central region of the ZI, connected with the dorsal prefrontal cortex. These results were shown to be replicable across multiple datasets and at the individual subject level, building evidence for the important role of the ZI in mediating frontal lobe-associated tasks, ranging from motor to cognitive to emotional control.

In eukaryotes, building whole custom genomes is still many years away, but work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is closing-in on the first synthetic eukaryotic genome with genome-wide design changes.

These enable inducible genomic rearrangements in vivo via expression of Cre recombinase via SCRaMbLE (Synthetic Chromosome Recombination and Modification by LoxPsym-mediated Evolution). When paired with selection, SCRaMbLE can quickly generate strains with phenotype improvements by diversifying gene arrangement and content in LoxPsym-containing regions.

We sought to clarify the significance of cardiac ketone metabolism during KD in HF. Mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction with apical myocardial infarction (TAC-MI) and fed either low-fat (LF) control or KD. Cardiac-specific mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2 (csMPC2-/-) mice were used as a second model of heart failure. In both mice, feeding a KD improved HF, determined by echocardiography, heart weights, and gene expression analyses. Although KD increases plasma ketone bodies, gene expression for ketone metabolic genes is decreased in the hearts of KD-fed mice. Cardiac-specific {beta}-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (csBDH1-/-), the first enzyme in ketone catabolism, mice were also studied and crossed with the csMPC2-/-mice to create double knockout (DKO) mice. These mice were aged to 16 weeks and switched to LF or KD, and KD was able to completely normalize the hearts of both csMPC2-/- and DKO mice, suggesting that ketone metabolism is unnecessary for improving heart failure with ketogenic diet. These studies were then repeated, and mice injected with U-13C-{beta}-hydroxybutyrate to evaluate ketone metabolism. KD feeding significantly decreased the enrichment of the TCA cycle from ketone body carbons, as did the BDH1-deletion in DKO mice. Gene expression and respirometry suggests that KD instead increases cardiac fat oxidation. In conclusion, these results suggest that ketogenic diet decreases cardiac ketone metabolism and does not require ketone metabolism to improve heart failure.",NA,biorxiv

In this study, we analyzed CTCF-binding sites and the distribution of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 around them in human K562 cells, and investigated the spreading of these modifications following CTCF depletion. Genome-wide analysis revealed that certain CTCF-binding sites are located at the boundaries of chromatin domains enriched with H3K9me2 or H3K9me3. Upon loss of CTCF binding, both modifications spread to neighboring chromatin at over half of the boundaries delimiting highly and distinctly enriched domains. Boundaries where such spreading did not occur were flanked by chromatin in a more active state compared to those where spreading occurred. Gene transcription was significantly reduced in neighboring regions where H3K9me2 or H3K9me3 had spread. Further comprehensive analysis revealed that this transcriptional reduction was specifically associated with the spread of H3K9me2. These findings suggest that CTCF-binding sites demarcate chromatin domains enriched with H3K9me2 or H3K9me3 and act as barriers to restrict the spread of these modifications in mammalian cells.

Differentiation was enhanced in APCs cultured in the presence of the adipose secretome, an effect that was diminished with scavenging of ROS and amplified when the secretome was collected from mice fed a high fat diet for 8 weeks. Proteomic analysis revealed that the adipose secretome from animals on a high fat diet was enriched in pathways related to immune cell-mediated inflammation, with interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a central regulator of differentially expressed proteins. A multiplex assay to measure cytokines confirmed higher IL-6 in the adipose secretome of high fat-fed animals. Exposure of APCs to IL-6 increased adipogenesis, while treatment of APCs with an IL-6 blocking antibodies diminished the adipogenic effect of the adipose secretome. Together, these findings substantiate a role for redox signaling in the regulation of adipogenesis and identify IL-6 as a novel activator of adipogenesis that may mediate APC differentiation via generation of ROS under obesogenic conditions.",NA,biorxiv

While extensively studied in Central Europe, European beech forests require further investigation to understand how climate change will affect these ecosystems in Mediterranean areas. Proposed silvicultural options increasingly aim at sustainable management to reduce biotic and abiotic stresses and enhance these forest ecosystems resistance and resilience mechanisms. Process-based models (PBMs) can help us to simulate such phenomena and capture early stress signals while considering the effect of different management approaches. In this study, we focus on estimating sensitivity of two state-of-the-art PBMs forest models by simulating carbon and water fluxes at the stand level to assess productivity changes and feedback resulting from different climatic forcings as well as different management regimes. We applied the 3D-CMCC-FEM and MEDFATE forest models for carbon (C) and water (H2O) fluxes in in two sites of the Italian peninsula, Cansiglio in the north and Mongiana in the south, under managed vs. unmanaged scenarios and under current climate and different climatic scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). To ensure confidence in the models results, we preliminary evaluated their performance in simulating C and H2O flux in three additional beech forests of the FLUXNET network along a latitudinal gradient spanning from Denmark to central Italy. The 3D-CMCC-FEM model achieved R{superscript 2} values of 0.83 and 0.86 with RMSEs of 2.53 and 2.05 for C and H2O fluxes, respectively. MEDFATE showed R{superscript 2} values of 0.76 and 0.69 with RMSEs of 2.54 and 3.01. At the Cansiglio site in northern Italy, both models simulated a general increase in C and H2O fluxes under the RCP8.5 climate scenario compared to the current climate. Still, no benefit in managed plots compared to unmanaged ones, as the site does not have water availability limitations, and thus, competition for water is low. At the Mongiana site in southern Italy, both models predict a decrease in C and H2O fluxes and sensitivity to the different climatic forcing compared to the current climate; and an increase in C and H2O fluxes when considering specific management regimes compared to unmanaged scenarios. Conversely, under unmanaged scenarios plots are simulated to experience first signals of mortality prematurely due to water stress (MEDFATE) and carbon starvation (3D-CMCC-FEM) scenarios. In conclusion, while management interventions may be considered a viable solution for the conservation of beech forests under future climate conditions at moister sites like Cansiglio, in drier sites like Mongiana conservation may not lie in management interventions alone.",10.1016/j.fecs.2024.100290,biorxiv

However, current methods to identify adaptive variation have two major limitations. First, when estimating genetic variation, most methods do not account for observational uncertainty in genetic data because of finite sampling and missing genotypes. Second, many current methods use phenomenological models to partition genetic variation into adaptive and non-adaptive components.
C_LIO_LIWe address these limitations by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model that explicitly accounts for observational uncertainty and underlying evolutionary processes. The first layer of the hierarchy is the data model that captures observational uncertainty by probabilistically linking RAD-sequence data to genetic variation. The second layer is a process model that represents how evolutionary forces, such as local adaptation, mutation, migration, and drift, maintain genetic variation. The third layer is the parameter model, which incorporates our knowledge about biological processes. For example, because most loci in the genome are expected to be neutral, the environmental sensitivity coefficients are assigned a regularized prior centered at zero. Together, the three models provide a rigorous probabilistic framework to identify local adaptation in wild organisms.
C_LIO_LIAnalysis of simulated RAD-seq data shows that our statistical model can reliably infer adaptive genetic variation. To show the real-world applicability of our method, we re-analyzed RAD-seq data ([~]105k SNPs) from Willow Flycatchers (Empidonax traillii) in the USA. We found 30 genes close to loci that showed a statistically significant association with temperature seasonality. Gene ontology suggests that several of these genes play a crucial role in egg mineralization, feather development, and the ability to withstand extreme temperatures.
C_LIO_LIMoreover, the data and process models can be modified to accommodate a wide range of genetic datasets (e.g., pool and low coverage genome sequencing) and demographic histories (e.g., range shifts) to study climatic adaptation in a wide range of natural systems.

Ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has achieved mesoscopic (< 0.5 mm) imaging of angioarchitecture, revealing fine vascular details that were previously inaccessible in vivo. However, current mesoscopic MRI methods for imaging angioarchitecture face two major limitations. First, acquisition times are prohibitively long--often exceeding 40 minutes--making integration into everyday clinical practice and research projects impractical. Second, even with data successfully acquired, conventional data visualization methods--such as 2D slice browsing and 3D vessel segmentation renders--are rudimentary and have limited effectiveness for navigating and interpreting the complex vascular network. In this paper, we present a fast whole-brain MRI protocol that provides robust images of the brains venous network at 0.35 mm resolution in under seven minutes. Additionally, we introduce novel data processing and visualization techniques that enable identification of specific vessel types and more informative navigation of the complex vascular network. We demonstrate that, with these advancements, we can reproduce, in vivo and without intravenous contrast application, the seminal postmortem vasculature images of Duvernoy and Vannson (1999). Furthermore, leveraging the ability for MRI to cover the entire brain, we achieve, for the first time, whole-brain intracortical mesoscopic vein maps in humans. Our acquisition and post-processing methods lay the groundwork for detailed examination of vascular organization across individuals, brain regions, and cortical layers. More generally, these methods make mesoscopic imaging of angioarchitecture viable for broad neuroscientific and clinical applications.",NA,biorxiv

Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the etiological agent of multiple human malignancies, including Kaposis sarcoma (KS), remains a significant concern, particularly in AIDS patients. A CRISPR-Cas9 screening of matched primary rat mesenchymal stem cells (MM) and KSHV-transformed MM cells (KMM) identified key splicing factors involved in KSHV-induced cellular transformation. To elucidate the mechanisms by which KSHV-driven splicing reprogramming mediates cellular transformation, we performed transcriptomic sequencing, identifying 131 differential alternative splicing transcripts, with exon skipping as the predominant event. Notably, these transcripts were enriched in vascular permeability, multiple metabolic pathways and ERK1/2 signaling cascades, which play key roles in KSHV-induced oncogenesis. Further analyses of cells infected with KSHV mutants lacking latent genes including vFLIP, vCyclin and viral miRNAs, as well as cells overexpressing LANA, revealed their involvement in alternative splicing regulation. Among the identified splicing factors, FAM50A, a component of the spliceosome complex C, was found to be crucial for KSHV-mediated transformation. FAM50A knockout resulted in distinct splicing profiles in both MM and KMM cells, and significantly inhibited KSHV-driven proliferation, cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, FAM50A knockout altered SHP2 splicing, promoting an isoform with enhanced enzymatic activity that led to reduced STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation in KMM cells. These findings reveal a novel paradigm in which KSHV hijacks host splicing machinery, specifically FAM50A-mediated SHP2 splicing, to sustain STAT3 activation and drive oncogenic transformation.

ImportanceKaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes cancers such as Kaposis sarcoma, particularly in AIDS patients. This study uncovers how KSHV hijacks a fundamental cellular process called RNA splicing to promote cancer development. We identified key splicing events that alter critical pathways involved in vascular permeability, metabolism, and oncogenic signaling, particularly ERK1/2 and STAT3. A specific protein, FAM50A, was found to be essential for KSHV-driven cancerous transformation. Removing FAM50A disrupted splicing, weakening cancer-promoting signals. These findings provide new insights into how viruses manipulate host cells to drive cancer and highlight RNA splicing as a potential target for future therapies.",NA,biorxiv

In plants, dozens of TF families interact with distinct sets of binding sites (TFBSs) that reflect each TFs role in organismal function and species-specific adaptations. However, defining these roles and understanding broader patterns of regulatory evolution remains challenging, as predicted TFBSs may lack a clear impact on transcription, and experimentally-derived TF binding maps to date are modest in scale or restricted to model organisms. Here, we present a scalable TFBS assay that we leveraged to create an atlas of nearly 3,000 genome-wide binding site maps for 360 TFs in 10 species spanning 150 million years of flowering plant evolution. We find that TF orthologs from distant species retain nearly identical binding preferences, suggesting that regulatory evolution primarily arises from gain and loss of TFBSs. Within lineages however, conserved TFBSs are over-represented and found in regions harboring signatures of functional regulatory elements. Moreover, genes with conserved TFBSs showed a striking enrichment for cell type-specific expression in single-nuclei RNA atlases, providing a robust marker of each TFs activity and developmental role. Finally, we compare distant lineages, illustrating how ancient regulatory modules were recruited and rewired to enable adaptations underlying the evolutionary success of grasses.",NA,biorxiv

The compound 4-[[2-[[5- (1H-indol-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]sulfanyl]acetyl]amino]benzoate (C35) was recently identified as a new potential antimicrobial agent for its ability to bind Hb and hamper its interaction with the staphylococcal hemophore IsdB in vitro. Here, we show that C35 inhibits S. aureus growth by specifically targeting the hemophore-driven iron acquisition system. Our findings confirm both the potential of C35 as a first-in-class protein-protein interaction inhibitor with antimicrobial activity, and the effectiveness of targeting hemophores as a strategy to inhibit S. aureus growth. To gain information for drug discovery purposes, the X-ray structure of Hb in the presence of the compound was solved. Unexpectedly, we discovered that, rather than the predicted binding pose, the molecule binds to tetrameric Hb in a cleft between the alpha subunits, stabilizing an R2 relaxed Hb conformation. This triggered further investigation of the effect of C35 on Hb functional properties, which showed a pronounced left-shift activity on oxygen binding curve (i.e., it strongly increases the Hb oxygen affinity). These results highlight C35 as a promising dual-acting compound with both antimicrobial activity and the ability to modulate Hb function through non-covalent stabilization of a high-affinity state.

Author SummaryStaphylococcus aureus is a dangerous bacterium that can cause severe infections in humans. To grow and survive it needs iron, which it steals from our red blood cells by taking it from hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood. In this study, we focused on a small molecule, called C35, that blocks the interaction between hemoglobin and a key bacterial protein involved in heme acquisition. We found that C35 strongly inhibits the growth of S. aureus when hemoglobin is the only available source of iron, showing a potential new method to starve the pathogen and consequently fight the infection. Surprisingly, we also found that C35 increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. This dual action makes C35 a unique molecule for future therapeutic development, with potential applications both as a new antimicrobial agent and in the treatment of diseases related to hemoglobin function.",NA,biorxiv

Spatial chromatin structures comprise conserved compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and dynamic, cell-type-specific chromatin loops. Although the role of CTCF in chromatin organization is well-known, the involvement of PRC1 is less understood. In this study, we identified an unexpected, essential role for the canonical Pcgf2-containing PRC1 complex (cPRC1.2), a known transcriptional repressor, in activating bivalent genes during differentiation. Our Hi-C analysis revealed that cPRC1.2 forms chromatin loops at bivalent promoters, rendering them silent yet poised for activation. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we found that the loss of Pcgf2, though not affecting the global level of H2AK119ub1, disrupts these cPRC1.2 loops in ESCs and impairs the transcriptional induction of crucial target genes necessary for neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we identified CTCF enrichment at cPRC1.2 loop anchors and at Polycomb group (PcG) bodies, nuclear foci with concentrated PRC1 and its tethered chromatin domains, suggesting that PRC1 and CTCF cooperatively shape chromatin loop structures. Through virtual 4C and other genomic analyses, we discovered that establishing neuronal progenitor cell (NPC) identity involves a switch from cPRC1.2-mediated chromatin loops to CTCF-mediated active loops, enabling the expression of critical lineage-specific factors. This study uncovers a novel mechanism by which pre-formed PRC1 and CTCF loops at lineage-specific genes maintain a poised state for subsequent gene activation, advancing our understanding of the role of chromatin architecture in controlling cell fate transitions.",NA,biorxiv

To address this, we compared three mechanistically distinct nuclei isolation strategies with brain tissues: a sucrose gradient centrifugation-based method, a spin column-based method, and a machine-assisted platform. All methods successfully captured diverse cell types but revealed considerable protocol-dependent differences in cell type proportions, transcriptional homogeneity, and the preservation of cell-type-specific and cell-state-specific markers. Moreover, isolation workflows differentially influenced contamination levels from ambient, mitochondrial, and ribosomal RNAs. Our findings establish nuclei isolation methodology as a critical experimental variable shaping snRNA-seq data quality and biological interpretation.

MOTIVATIONSingle-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) has become an essential tool for transcriptomic analysis of complex tissues. However, the quality and efficiency of data generation depend heavily on the method used for nuclear isolation. The existing isolation techniques vary in their ability to preserve nuclear integrity, minimize ambient RNA contamination, and optimize recovery rates. Despite these differences in quality, a systematic comparison of these methods, specifically for brain tissue, is lacking. This gap poses a challenge for researchers in choosing the most suitable approach for their particular experimental requirements. To address this critical issue, our study directly compared three nuclei isolation methods and evaluated their performance in terms of yield, purity, and downstream sequencing quality.

Using density fractionation to physically separate OC fractions with varying degrees of mineral association and protection, this study aimed to assess distributions of these fractions and the geochemical factors influencing the most dominant and refractory mineral-associated, high-density fraction (HF) in mangrove soil. We conducted forest-wide soil sampling in the Gaburumata mangrove forest on Ishigaki Island, Japan, along three transects (upstream, midstream, downstream) and at five depths (until 100 cm). The OC in HF (OCHF) was the oldest (median {Delta}14C value of -13.81{per thousand}) and contributed most significantly to total soil OC (43%-63%) and nitrogen (64%-85%). Among the extractable metals analyzed (aluminum [Al], iron [Fe], calcium [Ca], and magnesium [Mg]) with different crystallinity, only organically complexed Al and Fe showed strong positive correlations with OCHF. Together with high OCHF:Fe ratios that surpassed the maximum sorptive capacity of Fe oxides, these results indicate that co-precipitation of OC and Fe was the dominant mode of organo-mineral associations. The low clay content reduced the importance of Ca and Mg on OCHF, as these divalent cations typically facilitate OC stabilization through cation bridging between negatively charged clay surfaces and organic matter. Furthermore, the {Delta}14C-OC relationship suggested efficient incorporation of mangrove-derived modern C into HF, in addition to the pre-existing old C. Thus, mangrove expansion is likely to enhance stable soil OC pools in addition to increasing plant biomass and litter. Overall, this study proposes a biogeochemical mechanism for how stable mangrove OC is newly formed, as well as maintained, with ramifications for global mangrove expansion and plantation efforts.",10.1016/j.catena.2025.109075,biorxiv

As PD has no significant cure or treatments to this day, early diagnosis, or detections of PD within potential patients is a crucial task to maximize the effect of mediations which are implemented to achieve temporal prohibition of motor failure progression. In recent research, alongside conventional diagnosis methods based on neurological examinations or MRI based brain imaging, use of deep learning based artificial intelligence models, such as CNN, are repeatedly reported to have significant progress in detecting PD in early stages with high performance. Based on current success, this research attempted to further enhance AI-driven PD diagnosis by developing a deep learning based causal representation learning framework that extracts only highly robust PD features from simple hand drawings. Specifically, convolutional VAE based reconstruction and information theory based weakly supervised learning were linked with causal representation learning methods to distinguish significant PD features from geometrical features within hand drawing images. Not only aiding conventional tests for PD diagnosis, but also giving reliable representations of PD features such as tremor and rigidity, developed framework was found to achieve high performance in both retrieving latent factors of PD in images and predicting PD diagnosis results.",NA,biorxiv

We found that SMA type II patient muscles display a reduced number of quiescent PAX7+ Muscle Stem Cells (MuSC). In SMA mice, we showed that SMN is an important regulator of myogenic progenitor fate during early postnatal growth. In Pax7 Cre-driven conditional knockout mouse models, we demonstrated that high levels of SMN are required to ensure the maintenance of the quiescent MuSC pool in adult muscle.

Herein, we evaluated the effects of menaquinone-9 (MK9), a bacterially produced form of vitamin K on bone tissue quality and density in young mice. Four-week-old male (n=32) and female (n=32) C57BL/6 mice were supplemented with 0.06 mg/kg diet or 2.1 mg/kg diet of MK9 for 12 weeks.

Gene expression profiling from postmortem brain tissue is a promising approach to identify causal pathways; however, there are challenges to definitively resolve the upstream pathologic triggers along with the downstream consequences for AD clinical manifestations. We have functionally dissected 30 AD-associated gene coexpression modules using a cross-species strategy in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) models. Integrating longitudinal RNA-sequencing and behavioral phenotyping, we interrogated the unique and shared transcriptional responses to amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles, and/or aging, along with potential links to progressive neuronal dysfunction. Our results highlight hundreds of conserved, differentially expressed genes mapping to human AD regulatory networks. To confirm causal modules and pinpoint AD network drivers, we performed systematic in vivo genetic manipulations of 357 conserved, prioritized targets, identifying 141 modifiers of A{beta}- and/or tau-induced neurodegeneration. We discover an up-regulated network that is significantly enriched for both AD risk variants and markers of immunity / inflammation, and which promotes A{beta} and tau-mediated neurodegeneration based on fly genetic manipulations in neurons. By contrast, a synaptic regulatory network is strongly downregulated in human brains with AD and is enriched for loss-of-function suppressors of A{beta}/tau in Drosophila. Additional experiments suggest that this human brain transcriptional module may respond to and modulate A{beta}-induced glutamatergic hyperactivation injury.

We previously characterized the Maintenance of Carboxysome Distribution (Mcd) system in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, where the ParA-like ATPase McdA binds the nucleoid and interacts with its partner protein, McdB, to generate dynamic gradients that distribute carboxysomes for optimal carbon fixation. Here, we investigate how nucleoid compaction impacts carboxysome positioning, particularly during metabolic dormancy when McdAB activity is downregulated. We demonstrate that a compacted nucleoid maintains carboxysome organization in the absence of active McdAB-driven positioning. This finding reveals that the nucleoid is not merely a passive substrate for positioning, but an active player in spatial organization. Given the widespread role of ParA-family ATPases in the positioning of diverse cellular cargos, our study suggests that nucleoid compaction state is a fundamental, yet underappreciated, determinant of mesoscale organization across bacteria.",NA,biorxiv

This structure includes nine outer doublet microtubules (DMTs) that house various macromolecular complexes. The nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) forms a crossbridge between adjacent DMTs, stabilizing them and facilitates sperm tail bending. Our study of ANKRD5, which is highly expressed in the sperm axoneme, reveals its interaction with DRC5/TCTE1 and DRC4/GAS8, both critical components of the N-DRC, and these interactions were found to be independent of calcium regulation. ANKRD5-/- mice exhibited reduced sperm motility and male infertility. Cryo-electron tomography analysis reveals typical ""9+2"" axoneme and intact DMT structures in Ankrd5-/- mouse sperm, but the DMTs displayed significant morphological variations and greater structural heterogeneity. Furthermore, ANKRD5 deficiency did not affect ATP level, ROS levels, or mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings suggest that ANKRD5 may weaken the N-DRCs ""car bumper"" role, reducing the buffering effect between adjacent DMTs and thereby destabilizing axoneme structures during intense axoneme motility.

The axoneme, serving as the sperms motor apparatus, features a 9+2 microtubule arrangement, with the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) providing essential structural support between outer microtubule doublets. Understanding the synergistic relationship between the N-DRCs structure and its protein composition is crucial for advancing male reproductive biology. In this study, we identify the protein ANKRD5 as a component of the axoneme that can interact with N-DRC components, which is crucial for sperm motility. This discovery enhances our understanding of sperm motility mechanisms and suggests potential targets for male contraceptive development.",NA,biorxiv

Compared to resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), tb-fMRI provides greater specificity and interpretability, making it a valuable tool for examining task-relevant networks and individual differences in brain function. In this study, we evaluated the utility of the BOLD-filter-a method originally developed to extract reliable BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) components from rs-fMRI-by applying it to tb-fMRI data as a preprocessing step for functional connectivity (FC) analysis. The goal was to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of detecting task-induced functional activity. Compared to the conventional preprocessing method, the BOLD-filter substantially improved the isolation of task-evoked BOLD signals. It identified over eleven times more activation voxels at a high statistical threshold and more than twice as many at a lower threshold. Moreover, FC networks derived from BOLD-filtered signals revealed clearer task-related patterns, including gender-specific differences in brain regions linked to everyday behaviors. These patterns were not detectable using standard preprocessing approaches. Our findings demonstrate that the BOLD-filter enhances the robustness and interpretability of FC analysis in tb-fMRI. By effectively isolating meaningful functional networks, this approach offers significant advantages over conventional preprocessing methods. The BOLD-filter holds promise for advancing both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications by enabling more precise characterization of task-induced brain activity.",NA,biorxiv

Upon stimulation, WPBs traffic to the cell surface to secrete cargo such as von Willebrand factor (VWF), essential for platelet recruitment, and P-selectin, which facilitates the capture and subsequent rolling of immune cells. While this process is critical, many aspects of WPB trafficking and exocytosis remain unclear--particularly how release sites are selected across the cell surface and how fusion is directed to either the apical (lumen-facing) or basolateral (basement membrane-facing) side. These decisions directly impact the biological consequences and effectiveness of the secreted proteins. Using live-cell imaging, fibronectin micropatterning, loss-of-function and biochemical assays, we identified trafficking and release at hot spots near focal adhesions (FAs). We also discovered that the FA-resident guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), {beta}-PIX (ARHGEF7), regulates VWF secretion. {beta}-PIX is known to activate Rho GTPases (Cdc42/Rac), triggering downstream p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) signalling and cytoskeletal remodelling. Here, depletion of {beta}-PIX impaired VWF secretion and delayed its release by perturbing cytoskeletal reorganisation. Knockdown and rescue experiments using truncated mutants further revealed which domains of {beta}-PIX are necessary for exocytosis and cytoskeletal reorganisation. This is the first demonstration of {beta}-PIXs role in VWF secretion from endothelial cells and our data provides new insights into spatial targeting of WPB exocytosis. Such targeting may be essential for guiding leukocyte transmigration or platelet binding, thereby maintaining vascular integrity.

SchematicEndothelial secretory organelles, known as Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), store von Willebrand factor (VWF), and their regulated exocytosis is critical for blood clotting and immune responses. This process can be stimulated experimentally by phorbol esters as well as physiological stimuli such as adrenaline and histamine. Cytoskeletal remodelling is required for both pre- and post-fusion events in this secretory pathway. Here, we present evidence supporting the involvement of focal adhesion (FA)-associated exocytosis in the release of WPBs. For the first time, we demonstrate a regulatory role for the FA-resident guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) {beta}-PIX in VWF secretion. Through its GEF activity toward Cdc42 and Rac, {beta}-PIX activates p21-activated kinases, driving the necessary cytoskeletal dynamics. Disruption of {beta}-PIX function results in abnormal cytoskeletal architecture that fails to respond appropriately to phorbol ester stimulation. Consequently, F-actin, nonmuscle myosin IIA (NMIIA), and septins become mislocalised, forming prominent filaments above the nucleus. These data provide a novel insight into the spatial targeting and molecular events underpinning the exocytosis of endothelial secretory organelles.

While the strength of dimerization, KD, is commonly quantified in solution (3D), many proteins like the soluble BAR domain-containing proteins also reversibly dimerize while bound to a membrane surface (2D). The ratio of dissociation constants, [Formula], defines a lengthscale that is essential for determining whether dimerization is more favorable in solution or on the membrane surface, particularly for these proteins that reversibly transition between 3D and 2D. While purely entropic rigid-body estimates of h apply well to transmembrane adhesion proteins, we show here using Molecular Dynamics simulations that even moderate flexibility in BAR domains dramatically alters the free energy landscape from 3D to 2D, driving enhanced selectivity and stability of the native dimer in 2D. By simulating BAR homodimerization in three distinct environments, 1) solution (3D), 2) bound to a lipid bilayer (2D), and 3) fully solvated but restrained to a pseudo membrane (2D), we show that both 2D environments induce backbone configurations that better match the crystal structure and produce more enthalpically favorable dimer states, violating the rigid-body estimates to drive h<<hRIGID. Remarkably, contact with an explicit lipid bilayer is not necessary to drive these changes, as the solvated pseudo membrane induces this same result. We show this outcome depends on the stability of the protein interaction, as a parameterization that produces exceptionally stable binding in 3D does not induce systematic improvements on the membrane. With h lengthscales calculated here that are well below a physiological volume-to-surface-area lengthscale, assembly will be dramatically enhanced on the membrane, which aligns with BAR domain function as membrane remodelers. Our approach provides simple metrics to move beyond rigid-body estimates of 2D affinities and assess whether conformational flexibility selects for enhanced stability on membranes.",NA,biorxiv

In a transgenic mouse line that ubiquitously overexpresses human mitochondrial catalase (mCAT), ROS is reduced 1 day after injury to the granule cell progenitors, and we demonstrate that several steps in the regenerative process of NEPs are curtailed leading to reduced cerebellar growth. We also provide evidence that microglia are involved in one step of adaptive reprogramming by regulating NEP replenishment of the granule cell precursors. Collectively, our results highlight that changes in the tissue microenvironment regulate multiple steps in adaptative reprogramming of NEPs upon death of cerebellar granule cell progenitors at birth, highlighting the instructive roles of microenvironmental signals during regeneration of the neonatal brain.",NA,biorxiv

Phylogenetic analysis of evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) in protein sequence has been shown to be effective for large-scale prediction of functional relationships and interactions. However, gene duplication, gene loss, and other sources of phylogenetic incongruence are barriers for analyzing ERC on a genome-wide basis. Here, we developed ERCnet, a bioinformatic program designed to overcome these challenges, facilitating efficient all- vs-all ERC analyses for large protein sequence datasets. We simulated proteome datasets and found that ERCnet achieves combined false positive and negative error rates well below 10% and that our novel  branch-by-branch length measurements outperforms  root-to-tip approaches in most cases, offering a valuable new strategy for performing ERC. We also compiled a sample set of 35 angiosperm genomes to test the performance of ERCnet on empirical data, including its sensitivity to user-defined analysis parameters such as input dataset size and branch-length measurement strategy. We investigated the overlap between ERCnet runs with different species samples to understand how species number and composition affect predicted interactions and to identify the protein sets that consistently exhibit ERC across angiosperms. Our systematic exploration of the performance of ERCnet provides a roadmap for design of future ERC analyses to predict functional interactions in a wide array of genomic datasets.

Only two such variants have been reported to cause ROSAH syndrome to date: 66 out of 67 patients harbour the Thr237Met variant, while a single patient carries a Tyr254Cys variant. Here we identify a family in which ROSAH syndrome is caused by a Ser277Phe variant in ALPK1. The phenotypic variability in this family is high, with four of the seven individuals legally blind. Hypohidrosis, splenomegaly and arthritis were present in several family members. In contrast to wildtype ALPK1, which is activated specifically by the bacterial metabolite ADP-heptose during bacterial infection, ALPK1[Ser277Phe] was also activated by the human metabolites UDP-mannose and ADP-ribose, even more strongly than the ALPK1[Thr237Met] variant. However, unlike ALPK1[Thr237Met], ALPK1[Ser277Phe] could additionally be activated by GDP-mannose. These observations can explain why these ALPK1 variants are active in cells in the absence of ADP-heptose and hence why patients have episodes of autoinflammation. Examination of the three-dimensional structure of ALPK1 revealed that the sidechains of Ser277 and Tyr254 interact but mutational analysis established that this interaction is not critical for the integrity of the ADP-heptose binding site. Instead, it is replacement of Ser277 by a large hydrophobic phenylalanine residue or the replacement of Tyr254 by a much smaller cysteine residue that is responsible for altering the specificity of the ADP-heptose-binding pocket. The characterisation of ALPK1 variants that cause ROSAH syndrome suggests ways in which drugs that inhibit these disease-causing variants selectively can be developed.",NA,biorxiv

Natural speech encodes cues at distinct timescales. Phonetic features have modulation frequencies of 30-50 Hz, syllables and words around 4-7 Hz, and phrases 1-2 Hz. Strikingly, these frequencies mirror frequencies of endogenous network rhythms of the brain and synaptic time constants of the underlying neural circuits. Here, we suggest that endogenous brain rhythms serve as priors for speech recognition, encoding knowledge of speech structure in the dynamics of network computations. In a network of coupled oscillators, we find that speech is readily identified when characteristic frequencies of the oscillators match frequencies of circuit rhythms in the brain. When signal and circuit rhythms are mismatched, speech identification is impaired. Compared to a baseline recurrent neural network without intrinsic oscillations, the coupled oscillatory network has significantly higher performance in speech recognition across languages, but not in the recognition of signals that lack speech-like structure, such as urban sounds.

Here, we studied the temporal evolution of large-scale cortical networks, and show that while network dynamics are stochastic, the overall ordering of their activity forms a robust cyclical pattern. This cyclical structure groups states with similar function and spectral content at specific phases of the cycle and occurs at timescales of (300-1000 ms). These results are reproduced in five large magnetoencephalography (MEG) datasets. Moreover, we show that metrics that characterize the cycle strength and speed are heritable, and relate to age, cognition, and behavioural performance.

Recent studies have shown that changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota are closely related to the onset and development of hypertension. However, the individual differences in gut microbiota species make it difficult for traditional analysis methods to effectively reveal the pathogenic mechanisms of hypertension. In contrast, the inter-individual variability in gut microbial metabolites is much smaller, allowing for better cross-individual comparisons and reducing confounding factors in analysis. The interactions between gut microbiota and metabolites are highly complex, and network analysis can systematically capture this complexity. In this study Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) was utilized to predict the metabolic flux of gut microbiota and constructed cross-feeding networks. Random Forest and XGBoost models were employed to identify metabolites associated with hypertension. A differential microbial correlation network was used to analyze important metabolically related microbial sub-networks, and ultimately, the metabolic abnormalities and metabolite-related pathways were analyzed at the network level using the metabolite correlation network and cross-feeding networks. It was observed that the interaction patterns among 25 species--collectively referred to as the KEPR guild, with the most abundant genera being Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Klebsiella, and Parabacteroides--changed, leading to alterations in 12 metabolites, such as choline (chol), 1-butanol (btoh), trimethylamine (tma), cytidine (cytd), and betaine (glyb) etc. Choline can be oxidized to form betaine, thereby affecting host blood pressure. Abnormalities in siroheme and methanethiol may result in reduced secretion of hydrogen sulfide by microbes, which in turn impacts blood pressure regulation mechanisms. The changes in these 12 metabolites may also enhance the degradation of mucin-type O-glycans and reduce butyrate metabolic activity, weakening the protective ability of intestinal epithelial cells. This may lead to inflammation and oxidative stress, exacerbating endothelial cell damage and consequently resulting in endothelial dysfunction and increased blood pressure. The findings of this study provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of hypertension and offer potential targets for clinical intervention.",NA,biorxiv

Here we identified that uridine cytidine kinase (UCK), the first and rate-limiting kinase of the pyrimidine salvage pathway, could effectively phosphorylate N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC), the active compound of molnupiravir, and thereby dictate its anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy, as well as its selectivity index. Using target engagement and enzyme kinetic assays, we demonstrate that recombinant UCK isoform 1 (UCK1) and 2 (UCK2) effectively bind and phosphorylate NHC, with UCK2 displaying 9-fold higher catalytic efficiency. Accordingly, in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, downregulation of UCK2 via siRNA hampered the intracellular accumulation of the triphosphate antiviral metabolite of NHC, resulting in 10-fold reduction of antiviral efficacy. Furthermore, we could recapitulate this using a pan-UCK small molecule inhibitor. Critically, both UCK downregulation and inhibition significantly reduced the selectivity index of molnupiravir/NHC.

On the basis of a comprehensive review of the original studies, we highlight numerous issues in this database, such as errors in insect counts, sampling biases, inclusion of noninsects driving assemblage trends, omission of drivers investigated in original studies and inaccurate assessment of local cropland cover.

These internal drivers created situations more frequently favouring an increase than a decrease in insects and were unlikely to be representative of habitat conditions worldwide. We demonstrate that when both groups were available in original freshwater studies, selecting all invertebrates rather than only insects led to an overestimation of the ""insect"" trend.

We then compared the abilities of different T cell expansion candidate models to recapitulate a novel in vitro data set of CAR T cells targeting various myeloid antigens on leukemic target cells with different TP53 genotypes. We used Bayesian parameter inference for each candidate model based on the in vitro assay. This approach enabled us to statistically compare candidate models with competing assumptions and select a model that best described the in vitro cytolytic assay longitudinal dynamics. The best-performing CAR T cell expansion model accounts for the detrimental effects of a T cells average time to eliminate a leukemia cell and for effector T cell self-interference. We validated this model on unseen data and used it to predict the expected long-term outcomes of single- and multi-dose CAR T cell therapy against acute myeloid leukemia. Our work demonstrates the utility of predator-prey-like mathematical models and Bayesian inference to investigate and assess the performance of novel CAR T cell constructs, helping to guide the translation to clinically relevant and feasible dosing strategies.",NA,biorxiv

Modelling this phenomenon in simulations can enhance our understanding of the characteristics of natural intelligence. In this work, we present a novel approach to model foraging in-silico using a continuous coupled dynamical system. The dynamical system is composed of three differential equations, representing the position of the agent, the agents control policy, and the environmental resource dynamics. Crucially, the control policy is implemented as a parameterized differential equation which allows the control policy to adapt in order to solve the foraging task. Using this setup, we show that when these dynamics are coupled and the controller parameters are optimized to maximize the rate of reward collected, adaptive foraging emerges in the agent. We further show that the internal dynamics of the controller, as a surrogate brain model, closely resemble the dynamics of the evidence accumulation mechanism, which may be used by certain neurons of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex region in non-human primates, for deciding when to migrate from one patch to another. We show that by modulating the resource growth rates of the environment, the emergent behaviour of the artificial agent agrees with the predictions of the optimal foraging theory. Finally, we demonstrate how the framework can be extended to stochastic and multi-agent settings.

Author SummaryIntelligence is a phenomenon that arises due to the interactions of an agents dynamics with the environments dynamics under the assumption that the agent seeks optimization of certain objective. Modelling both these dynamics as a single coupled dynamical system can shed light on patterns of intelligence that unfold in time. This report aims to provide a minimal in-silico framework that models the main components involved in natural phenomena, like optimal foraging, as a coupled dynamical system. Interestingly, we observe similarities between the surrogate brain dynamics of the artificial agent with the evidence accumulation mechanism that can be responsible for decision-making in certain non-human primates performing a similar foraging task. We also observe similarities between trends prescribed by theories prevalent in behavioural ecology such as the optimal foraging theory and those shown by the artificial agent. Such similarities can increase the predictability and explainability of artificial systems. We can now expect them to mimic these natural decision-making mechanisms by replicating such trends and we can thus understand the reasoning behind their actions. They can also increase the confidence of researchers to consider using such artificial agent models as simulation tools to make predictions and test hypotheses about aspects of natural intelligence.",NA,biorxiv

Human P. aeruginosa infections are predominantly caused by a small number of sequence types (ST), such as ST235, ST111, and ST175. Although ST111 is recognized as one of the most prevalent high-risk P. aeruginosa clones worldwide and frequently exhibits multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant phenotypes, the basis for this dominance remains unclear. In this study, we used a genome-wide transposon insertion library screen to discover that the competitive advantage of ST111 strains over certain non-ST111 strains is through production of R pyocins. We confirmed this finding by showing that competitive dominance was lost by ST111 mutants with R pyocin gene deletions. Further investigation showed that sensitivity to ST111 R pyocin (specifically R5 pyocin) is caused by deficiency in the O-antigen ligase waaL, which leaves lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bereft of O antigen, enabling pyocins to bind the LPS core. In contrast, sensitivity of waaL mutants to R1 or R2 pyocins depended on additional genomic changes. In addition, we found the PA14 mutants in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (waaL, wbpL, wbpM) that cause high susceptibility to R pyocins also exhibit poor swimming motility. Analysis of 5,135 typed P. aeruginosa strains revealed that several international, high-risk sequence types (including ST235, ST111, and ST175) are enriched for R5 pyocin production, indicating a correlation between these phenotypes and suggesting a novel approach for evaluating risk from emerging prevalent P. aeruginosa strains. Overall, our study sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the dominance of ST111 strains and highlighting the role of waaL in extending spectrum of R pyocin susceptibility.",NA,biorxiv

This multi-level approach balances fine-grained precision with computational efficiency, enabling conformational landscape sampling in hours rather than the weeks required by traditional simulations. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that OC2 accurately reproduces experimentally determined protein and RNA ensembles, generates conformational distributions comparable to millisecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, and captures functionally relevant transitions in important biological scenarios including allostery, induced-fit mechanisms, and cryptic pocket formation. OC2 also effectively models small molecule conformations with high validity, identifies multiple binding sites, and maintains competitive accuracy on structure prediction benchmarks, while scaling to ultra-large molecular assemblies exceeding 15,000 residues.

Previous studies in our lab have shown that administration of OT into the fourth ventricle (4V; hindbrain) elicits weight loss and stimulates interscapular brown adipose tissue temperature (TIBAT) in DIO rats. We hypothesized that OT-elicited stimulation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation of IBAT contributes to its ability to activate BAT and reduce BW in DIO rats. To test this, we determined the effect of disrupting SNS activation of IBAT on OT-elicited stimulation of TIBAT and reduction of BW in DIO rats. We first confirmed that bilateral surgical SNS denervation to IBAT was successful based on having achieved [&ge;] 60% reduction in IBAT norepinephrine (NE) content from DIO rats. NE content was selectively reduced in IBAT by 94.7 {+/-} 2.7, 96.8 {+/-} 1.8 and 85.9 {+/-} 6.1% (P<0.05) at 1, 6 and 7-weeks post-denervation, respectively, and was unchanged in liver or inguinal white adipose tissue. We then measured the impact of bilateral surgical SNS denervation to IBAT on the ability of acute 4V OT (1, 5 {micro}g) to stimulate TIBAT in DIO rats. We found that the high dose of 4V OT (5 {micro}g) stimulated TIBAT similarly between sham and denervated rats (P=NS) and that the effects of 4V OT to stimulate TIBAT did not require beta-3 adrenergic receptor signaling. We subsequently measured the effect of bilateral surgical denervation of IBAT on the effect of chronic 4V OT (16 nmol/day) or vehicle infusion to reduce BW, adiposity and energy intake in DIO rats. Chronic 4V OT reduced BW gain by -7.2 {+/-} 9.6 g and -14.1 {+/-} 8.8 g in sham and denervated rats (P<0.05 vs vehicle treatment), respectively, and this effect was similar between groups (P=NS).

The failure rate of monotherapy with conventional antibiotics is high, and invasive infections by this bacterium frequently require extensive supportive care and surgical intervention. Thus, it is important to find new compounds with adjunctive therapeutic benefits. The conserved secreted protease streptopain (Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B; SpeB) directly contributes to disease pathogenesis by inducing pathological inflammation, degrading tissue, and promoting the evasion of antimicrobial host defense proteins. This study screened 400 diverse off-patent drug and drug-like compounds for inhibitors of streptopain proteolysis. Lead compounds were tested for activity at lower concentrations and anti-virulence activities during in vitro infection. Significant inhibition of streptopain was seen for pentamidine, an anti-protozoal drug approved for the treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia, leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis. Streptopain inhibition rendered GAS susceptible to killing by human innate immune cells. These studies identify unexploited molecules as new starting points for drug discovery and a potential for repurposing existing drugs for the treatment of infections by GAS.

IMPORTANCEStreptococcus pyogenes (group A strep; GAS) is a common cause of severe invasive infections. Repeated infections can trigger autoimmune diseases such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. This study examines how targeting a specific, highly conserved virulence factor of the secreted cysteine protease streptopain, can sensitize a serious pathogen to killing by the immune system. Manipulating the host-pathogen interaction, rather than attempting to directly kill a microbe, is a promising therapeutic strategy. Notably, its benefits include limiting off-target effects on the microbiota and potentially limiting the development and spread of resistance. Streptopain inhibitors, including the antifungal and antiparasitic drug pentamidine as identified in this work, may therefore be useful in the treatment of S. pyogenes infection.",NA,biorxiv

We used the pantropical Xylopia (Annonaceae) genus to address the diversification of rain forest lineages through time, across different regions, and into novel non-rain forest habitats with a comparative phylogenetic approach.

LocationGlobal (pantropical)

MethodsWe generated a time-calibrated phylogeny of Xylopia using hybrid capture sequence data, including 88% (168/191 spp.) of species within the genus. Diversification analyses were conducted to test for the presence of rate heterogeneity (BAMM, ClaDS, CoMET) and environmental-dependent (RPANDA), geographic-dependent, and habitat dependent (GeoHiSSE) diversification in Xylopia.

ResultsSignificant diversification rate heterogeneity was detected along the backbone of the core Xylopia clade, leading to near synchronous radiations across tropical regions globally in the Miocene, with higher diversification rates in Africa, Central America, and Madagascar, and lower rates in Australia + New Guinea. Transitions from rain forest to subhumid habitats led to lower diversification rates, whereas transitions to ultramafic habitats lead to higher rates. Regional diversification models indicate sea-level changes as an important driver for Asian, Australian, Pacific, and Neotropical clades and regional temperature changes as the main diversification driver for an African clade of Xylopia.

Main conclusionsOur study shows that despite synchronous radiations across regions, different regional environmental drivers have affected the diversification of Xylopia across tropical regions globally. A noteworthy example includes radiations of all five Malagasy clades c. 7 Ma coinciding with the establishment of heavy seasonal rainfall linked with the Indian monsoon. The diversification dynamics of rain forests are complex and heterogenous, with different clade-dependent and region-dependent environmental drivers.",NA,biorxiv

Strikingly, ectopic expression of FUS intron 6&7 sequences dissolves the endogenous FUSint6&7-RNA condensates, downregulating FUS mRNA and protein.

Here, we analyze experimental and simulated time series of disease spread within populations of the model disease system Daphnia magna-Ordospora colligata for EWS of epidemic emergence. In this system, low temperatures prevent disease emergence, while sufficiently high temperatures force the system through a critical transition to an epidemic state. We found that EWS of epidemic emergence were nearly as likely to be detected in populations maintained at a sub-epidemic temperature as they were to be detected in populations subjected to a warming treatment that induced epidemic spread. Our findings suggest that the detection of false positives may limit the reliability of EWS as predictors of climate-mediated epidemic emergence.",NA,biorxiv

Similar structures, named functional amyloids, expressed mostly by microorganisms, play important physiological roles, e.g. bacterial biofilm stabilization. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identify gut microbiome functional amyloids and analyze their potential impact on human health via the gut-brain axis. The results point to taxonomically diverse sources of functional amyloids and their frequent presence in the extracellular space. The retrieved interactions between gut microbiome functional amyloids and human proteins indicate their potential to trigger inflammation, affect transport and signaling processes. We also find a greater relative abundance of bacterial functional amyloids in patients diagnosed with Parkinsons disease and specifically a higher content of the curli amyloid protein, CsgA, in Alzheimers disease patients than in healthy controls. Our results provide a rationale for the tentative link between neurodegeneration and gut bacterial functional amyloids.",NA,biorxiv

Here we demonstrate that induction of high levels of HIF2 in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells results in a rapid and profound reduction of the oncoprotein MYCN. This is followed by an upregulation of genes characteristic of noradrenergic cells in the adrenal medulla. Additionally, upon induction of HIF2, the proliferation rate drops substantially, and cells develop elongated neurite-like protrusions, indicative of differentiation. In vivo HIF2 induction in established xenografts significantly attenuates tumour growth. Notably, analysis of sequenced neuroblastoma patient samples, revealed a negative correlation between EPAS1 and MYCN expression and a strong positive correlation between EPAS1 expression, high expression levels of noradrenergic markers, and improved patient outcome. This was paralleled by analysis of human adrenal medulla datasets wherein EPAS1 expression was prominent in populations with high expression levels of genes characteristic of noradrenergic chromaffin cells. Our findings show that high levels of HIF2 in neuroblastoma, leads to drastically reduced MYCN protein levels, cell cycle exit, and noradrenergic cell differentiation. Taken together, our results challenge the dogma that HIF2 acts as an oncogene in neuroblastoma and rather suggest that HIF2 has potential tumour suppressor capacity in this particular disease.

Significance statementHIF2 has been proposed as a neuroblastoma oncogene and a tractable target for clinical intervention, this has been questioned by several studies. Thus, it is necessary to move beyond correlative studies and better determine the function of HIF2 in neuroblastoma. Our study shows that induced expression of HIF2 in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma substantially reduces MYCN protein levels and attenuates proliferation while it induces several features of noradrenergic differentiation and impedes xenograft tumour growth. Together with bioinformatic analysis of sequenced neuroblastoma patient samples and the developing human adrenal medulla, this couples HIF2 to low-risk neuroblastoma with a substantially better patient outcome. Thus, in neuroblastoma HIF2 exhibit tumour suppressor capacity rather than oncogenic capacity.",NA,biorxiv

Interpreting neural activity in such ecological conditions remains a key challenge for neuroscience. This study leverages advancements in de-noising techniques and multivariate modeling to extract interpretable EEG signals from pairs of participants (male-male, female-female, and male-female) engaged in spontaneous dyadic dance. Using multivariate temporal response functions (mTRFs), we investigated how music acoustics, self-generated kinematics, other-generated kinematics, and social coordination uniquely contributed to EEG activity. Electromyogram recordings from ocular, face, and neck muscles were also modeled to control for artifacts. The mTRFs effectively disentangled neural signals associated with four processes: (I) auditory tracking of music, (II) control of self-generated movements, (III) visual monitoring of partner movements, and (IV) visual tracking of social coordination. We show that the first three neural signals are driven by event-related potentials: the P50-N100-P200 triggered by acoustic events, the central lateralized movement-related cortical potentials triggered by movement initiation, and the occipital N170 triggered by movement observation. Notably, the (previously unknown) neural marker of social coordination encodes the spatiotemporal alignment between dancers, surpassing the encoding of self-or partner-related kinematics taken alone. This marker emerges when partners can see each other, exhibits a topographical distribution over occipital areas, and is specifically driven by movement observation rather than initiation. Using data-driven kinematic decomposition, we further show that vertical bounce movements best drive observers EEG activity. These findings highlight the potential of real-world neuroimaging, combined with multivariate modeling, to uncover the mechanisms underlying complex yet natural social behaviors.

Significance statementReal-world brain function involves integrating multiple information streams simultaneously. However, due to a shortfall of computational methods, laboratory-based neuroscience often examines neural processes in isolation. Using multivariate modeling of EEG data from pairs of participants freely dancing to music, we demonstrate that it is possible to tease apart physiologically established neural processes associated with music perception, motor control, and observation of a partners movement. Crucially, we identify a previously unknown neural marker of social coordination that encodes the spatiotemporal alignment between dancers, beyond self- or partner-related kinematics alone. These findings highlight the potential of computational neuroscience to uncover the biological mechanisms underlying real-world social and motor behaviors, advancing our understanding of how the brain supports dynamic and interactive activities.",10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2372-24.2025,biorxiv

Chronic pain-related memory impairment has susceptible and unsusceptible features. Therefore, exploring the underlying mechanisms of its vulnerability is essential for developing effective treatments. Here, combining two spatial memory tests (Y-maze test and Morris water maze), we segregated chronic pain mice into memory impairment-susceptible and -unsusceptible subpopulations in a chronic neuropathic pain model induced by chronic constrictive injury of the sciatic nerve. RNA-seq analysis and gain/loss-of-function study revealed that S1P/S1PR1 signaling is a determinant for vulnerability to chronic pain-related memory impairment. Knockdown of the S1PR1 in the DG promoted a susceptible phenotype and led to structural plasticity changes of reduced excitatory synapse formation and abnormal spine morphology as observed in susceptible mice, while overexpression of the S1PR1 and pharmacological administration of S1PR1 agonist in the DG promoted an unsusceptible phenotype and prevented the occurrence of memory impairment, and rescued the morphological abnormality. Finally, GO enrichment analysis and biochemical evidence indicated that down-regulation of S1PR1 in susceptible mice may impair DG structural plasticity via interaction with actin cytoskeleton rearrangement-related signaling pathways including Itga2 and its downstream Rac1/Cdc42 signaling and Arp2/3 cascade. These results reveal a novel mechanism and provide a promising preventive and therapeutic molecular target for vulnerability to chronic pain-related memory impairment.",NA,biorxiv

This leads to a state of relative inhibition, reducing feedforward gamma (40-90 Hz) rhythms and spiking for predictable inputs. This is called predictive routing model. It is unclear which circuit mechanisms implement this push-pull interaction between alpha/beta and gamma rhythms. To explore how predictive routing is implemented, we developed a self-supervised learning algorithm we call generalized Stochastic Delta Rule (gSDR). Development of this algorithm was necessary because manual tuning of parameters (frequently used in computational modeling) is inefficient to search through a non-linear parameter space that leads to emergence of neuronal rhythms. We used gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits and validated the algorithm on simple objectives. Then we applied gSDR to model observed neurophysiology. We asked the model to reproduce a shift from baseline oscillatory dynamics ([~]<20Hz) to stimulus induced gamma ([~]40-90Hz) dynamics recorded in the macaque visual cortex. This gamma oscillation during stimulation emerged by self-modulation of synaptic weights via gSDR. We further showed that the gamma-beta push-pull interactions implied by predictive routing could emerge via stochastic modulation of the local circuitry as well as top-down modulatory inputs to a network. To summarize, gSDR succeeded in training biophysical neural circuits to satisfy a series of neuronal objectives. This revealed the inhibitory neuron mechanisms underlying the gamma-beta push-pull dynamics that are observed during predictive processing tasks in systems and cognitive neuroscience.

Significant StatementThis study contributes to the advancement of self-supervised learning for modeling the behavior of complex neural circuits and specifically, biophysical modeling. We performed simulations in order to examine basic mechanisms in predictive routing framework. Since generalized stochastic delta rule (gSDR) is in the family of evolutionary algorithms and does not rely on specific model-based assumptions, it could improve computational neuroscience studies by adding autonomous approaches in neural network research with emphasis on neurobiology. In addition, it is allows to expand bio-plausibility by defining multiple objectives, making it capable of expanding its neurobiological constraints.",NA,biorxiv

Human and animal lesion studies show that the connections comprising the fornix are vital for specific attributes of episodic and spatial memory. The fornix, however, interconnects the hippocampal formation with an array of subcortical and cortical sites and it is not known which specific connections support spatial-mnemonic function. To address this, making use of a partly previously published dataset (Hodgetts et al., 2020), we applied a novel deterministic tractography protocol to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data from a group of healthy young adult humans who separately completed a desktop-based virtual reality analogue of the Morris water maze task. The tractography protocol enabled the two main parts of the fornix, delineated previously in axonal tracing studies in rodents and primates, to be reconstructed in vivo, namely the pre-commissural fornix (connecting the hippocampus to the medial prefrontal cortex and the basal forebrain) and the post-commissural fornix (connecting the hippocampus to the medial diencephalon). We found that inter-individual differences in pre-commissural - but not, surprisingly, post-commissural - fornix microstructure (indexed by free water corrected fractional anisotropy, FA) were significantly correlated with individual differences in spatial learning, indexed by reduction in search error as individuals learned to navigate to a hidden target location from multiple starting points. This study provides novel evidence that flexible and/or precise spatial learning involves a hippocampal-basal forebrain/prefrontal network underpinned in part by the pre-commissural fornix.",NA,biorxiv

L6CT neurons have been reported to induce multiple effects, including the up- and down-modulation of cortical and thalamic firing rates, and the enhancement of high gamma oscillations in the local field potential (LFP) of the surrounding cortex. These recently reported oscillations offer a neuronal substrate to link recurrent thalamocortical interactions, a critical connection hinging on L6CT neurons, to high frequency oscillations, that have been implicated in several cognitive and pathological conditions. We hypothesize that the high gamma oscillations induced by L6CT neurons in the cortex depend on the dynamic engagement of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. To test this hypothesis, we optogenetically activated L6CT neurons in NTSR1-cre mice selectively expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in L6CT neurons. Leveraging the vibrissal pathway of awake, head-fixed mice, we presented LED ramp- and-hold inputs of different intensities while recording neuronal activity in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1), the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm), and the reticular nucleus (TRN) of thalamus using silicon probes. First, we confirmed that the activation of L6CT neurons induces high-frequency oscillation of S1 local field potential. These oscillations are modulated in frequency, but not in amplitude, across LED intensities and over time. To identify which neuronal classes contribute to these oscillations, we examined the evolution over time of the firing rate of cortical neurons across layers and electrophysiologic cell classes, VPm, and TRN. While the firing rate of most cortical and TRN neurons was steadily suppressed over time, the firing rate of VPm and Layer 4 fast spiking (L4 FS) neurons evolved from being suppressed to being facilitated within 500 ms. Using dimensionality reduction, we found that this pattern reflects two underlying components: one stable component that is represented across all units, and one evolving component that is mainly represented in VPm and in L4 FS neurons, suggestive of differential recruitment of the cortico-cortical vs cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. Finally, we related the firing rate of each unit to the amplitude and frequency of S1 LFP, finding that the evolution of S1 LFP amplitude weakly correlates with all neurons, while its frequency selectively correlates with VPm firing rate. Taken together, our data suggests that L6CT neurons generate high gamma oscillations in S1 LFP through a combination of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways and can sculpt its oscillation frequency through the cortico-thalamo-cortical pathway. Our findings provide a neuronal substrate for linking recurrent interactions, mediated by L6CT neurons, to the modulations of high gamma oscillations observed in several brain states and pathological conditions.",NA,biorxiv

CTPR390, an experimental anti-fibrotic inhibitor targeting Hsp90, has shown success in animal models, but remains unexplored in human cardiac models. This study evaluated a cardiac three-dimensional engineered connective tissue (ECT) model treated with CTPR390, focusing on changes in the extracellular matrix and fibroblasts. Results showed that CTPR390 prevented architectural changes in TGF{beta}1-activated ECT, preserving tissue perimeter, collagen fibers alignment while reducing percentage of structured areas and degree of collagen structuration. Additionally, the treatment reduced cell area of elongated fibroblasts under tension, without changes in the internal rounded cells devoid of tension. Fibroblast recruitment to tension areas was diminished, showing biomechanical behavior similar to control ECT. This treatment also lowered the gene and protein expression of key pro-fibrotic markers. For the first time, advanced biotechnology was employed to detect the detailed structure of tissue fibrosis reduction after administering CTPR390, representing a significant advancement toward clinical application for cardiac fibrosis treatment.

In plants, the endomembrane system mediates autophagic immune responses but can also be hijacked by pathogens to facilitate successful infections. In this study, we demonstrate that vesicle trafficking machinery acts as a double-edged sword during infection by the geminivirus tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSaV) in Nicotiana benthamiana. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of eight genes encoding key vesicle trafficking regulators revealed contrasting outcomes. Silencing of NbSAR1 and NbAP-1{gamma} significantly increased systemic geminiviral DNA accumulation, whereas silencing of Nb{delta}-COP, NbARF1, and clathrin genes almost completely abolished infection. Notably, this inhibition is hypothesized to result from direct or indirect impairment in viral movement, as replication remained unaffected by gene silencing. Furthermore, the observed effects affect other geminiviruses, including tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and beet curly top virus (BCTV), but not unrelated pathogens such as the RNA potato virus X (PVX) or the plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. These findings suggest that while the vacuolar and autophagy branches of the vesicle trafficking system might mediate antiviral autophagic defense responses, the integrity of endocytosis and retrograde transport is essential for systemic geminiviral infection.",NA,biorxiv

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the forefoot and rearfoot landing on the biomechanical risk of lower limb injury prevention and performance during the stop-jumping task.

MethodTwenty-three male health subjects were recruited for this study. During a stop-jumping task, three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic, and performance data were collected under two conditions: forefoot landing at initial ground contact and rearfoot landing at initial ground contact. Statistical parametric mapping analysis was used to compare the differences between different landing strategies.

ResultSignificant differences were found in ankle internal rotation angle and ankle joint moment at foot initial contact with ground between different landing strategies. Landing with forefoot has shorter stance time compared with landing with rearfoot. In the rearfoot strike, posterior ground reaction force (GRF) and GRF inclination angle were smaller than forefoot strike in 0-14% of the stance phase.

ConclusionLanding with forefoot may decrease the risk of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injuries and have an advancement in quick reaction time, as indicated by decreased stance time, but the risk of lateral ankle sprain may increase for the stop-jump task.",NA,biorxiv

Computational chemistry and machine learning methods have been developed to investigate these tasks. Despite the encouraging performance, virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization are often studied separately by existing methods, partially because they are performed sequentially in the existing drug discovery pipeline, thereby overlooking their interdependency and complementarity. To address this problem, we propose LigUnity, a foundation model for protein-ligand binding prediction by jointly optimizing virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization. In particular, LigUnity learns coarse-grained active/inactive distinction for virtual screening, and fine-grained pocket-specific ligand preference for hit-to-lead optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of LigUnity on eight benchmarks across both tasks. In virtual screening, LigUnity outperforms 24 competing methods with more than 50% improvement on the DUD-E and Dekois 2.0 benchmarks, and shows robust generalization to novel proteins. In hit-to-lead optimization, LigUnity achieves the best performance on split-by-time, split-by-scaffold, and split-by-unit settings, further demonstrating its potential as a cost-effective alternative to free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. We further showcase how LigUnity can be employed in an active learning framework to efficiently identify active ligands for TYK2, a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases, yielding over 40% improved prediction performance. Collectively, these comprehensive results establish LigUnity as a versatile foundation model for both virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization, offering broad applicability across the drug discovery pipeline through accurate protein-ligand affinity predictions.",NA,biorxiv

When digesting the cell wall, plant protoplasts form spherical shapes, further consolidating this model. Here we challenge this apparent opposition between animal and plant cells. We show that plant protoplasts can form protrusions. More precisely, using plasma membrane markers, we reveal that 27 {+/-} 1% of the protoplasts show dot-like protrusions and 16 {+/-} 7% of protoplasts show long (typically 1-20 m, up to 200 m) protrusions that we name ""filopods"". We demonstrate that this behavior is independent of the plant species, the membrane marker or the osmolyte. Protrusions can host large and long structures, such as microtubule bundles, which in turn can impact the mechanical behavior of the protrusions. We find that filopods can form de novo when increasing osmolarity, that they most likely move passively, and that they can attach to artificial surfaces. Altogether, these observations show that forming and retaining protrusions is not exclusive to animal cells. This calls for revisiting the dynamics and probing ability of the plant cell cortex in different osmotic and mechanical environments.",NA,biorxiv

We studied the role of the Hog1/p38 and Gcn2 signal transduction pathways during adaptation of C. neoformans to oxidative stress, a physiologically relevant stressor during infection. Using a combination of molecular assays and RNA-sequencing analysis in Hog1-, Gcn2-and double-deleted mutants, we identify shared targets of these pathways, and investigate a negative feedback loop that regulates induction of the integrated stress response (ISR). We found that simultaneous loss of Hog1 and Gcn2 profoundly impacts the ability of C. neoformans to tolerate oxidative stress. We also show that Hog1 regulates induction of the ISR, and that the Hog1 and Gcn2 pathways converge on repression of abundant, pro-growth mRNA, a key step in translatome reprogramming. Our results establish Hog1 and Gcn2 as key regulators of the response to oxidative stress, and demonstrate that the interplay between these pathways is critical for ROS tolerance in C. neoformans. More broadly, our results demonstrate the extent to which signaling via Hog1/p38 and Gcn2 are linked, and point to extensive recalibration of the cellular signaling apparatus when one of these pathways is disrupted.

Author SummaryCryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes deadly infections, resulting in approximately 112,000 deaths per year. In this study, we examined two genes that are important for the ability of C. neoformans to tolerate stressors it would encounter in the human body: Hog1 and Gcn2. We found that Hog1 and Gcn2 perform overlapping functions during the fungal response to stress. These findings are important because they highlight the potential benefits of targeting these pathways in conjunction to treat infection with C. neoformans. These findings could be used to develop new drug or treatment strategies to reduce the disease burden associated with this infection.",NA,biorxiv

We show that TlyA shares the common rRNA methyltransferase catalytic triad KDK and a SAM binding motif GxSxG which differs from Mtb TlyA. Together our work demonstrates that B. subtilis tlyA is critical for ribosome assembly and we identify key residues for TlyA function in vivo.

MethodsRNA was isolated from 85 OSCC tissues and adjacent normal mucosa followed by real-time (RT) PCR to quantify HIF1 and HIF2 expression using GAPDH and {beta}-actin respectively as reference genes.

ResultsHIF1 overexpression was detected in 76.47% of case and 71.76% of controls (p=0.4906), whereas HIF2 overexpression occurred in 91.76% of cases 94.11% of controls (p=0.35). HIF1 and HIF2 expression level were not significantly different in OSCC tissues compared to adjacent normal mucosa.

ConclusionHIF1 and HIF2 play important role in hypoxia induced pathways and tumor progression, yet this study found no significant variation in expression between OSCC tissues and surrounding normal tissues. This suggest that their expression may be due to physiological adaptability to hypoxia or stress, or may be due to use of adjacent tissue as control and loss of protein expression could be due to post translational modifications.",NA,biorxiv

GI motility is regulated by the enteric nervous system (ENS), suggesting that stress alters ENS biology to cause dysmotility. While stress increases glucocorticoid levels through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, how glucocorticoids affect GI motility is not known. Glucocorticoid signaling reduces expression of specific transcriptional isoforms of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the central nervous system, altering signaling through its receptor Tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) to cause behavioral defects. However, since the nature of ENS-specific Bdnf isoforms and their response to glucocorticoids remains unknown, we are limited in studying how stress impacts the ENS to cause dysmotility. Here, in male and female mice, we establish that stress-responsive Bdnf isoforms that are transcriptionally regulated at exons 4 and 6 represent >85% of all Bdnf isoforms in the post-natal ENS, and that Bdnf and Ntrk2 (TrkB) are expressed by enteric neurons. We further show using male mice dosed with a synthetic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist dexamethasone (Dexa), that increased glucocorticoid signaling in ENS significantly reduces the expression of Bdnf transcripts and protein and that it significantly reduces GI motility. Finally, by using HIOC, a specific synthetic agonist of TrkB, we observe that HIOC treatment significantly improved GI motility of a cohort of Dexa-treated male mice, when compared to Dexa-treated and HIOC-untreated mice. Our results implicate BDNF- TrkB signaling in the etiology of stress-associated dysmotility and suggest that TrkB is a putative therapeutic target for dysmotility in DGBI patients.

Significance statementThe mechanism through which stress-associated increase in glucocorticoid signaling causes gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility is not well understood. GI motility is regulated by the enteric nervous system, which depends on optimal signaling between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tropomyosin related kinase B (TrkB). The lack of clarity on whether glucocorticoid impact BDNF signaling in the ENS, analogous to the manner they affect BDNF in brain, has limited our understanding of stress-associated dysmotility. Here, by identifying the nature of Bdnf isoforms expressed in ENS, studying their response to increased glucocorticoid signaling, and testing the effect of TrkB agonist to promote healthy gut motility in a model of glucocorticoid-driven dysmotility, we implicate altered BDNF-TrkB signaling as the mechanism driving stress-associated dysmotility.",NA,biorxiv

To identify novel therapies for aggressive meningiomas, we established a multi-step drug screening workflow, focusing on targetable genes obtained from transcriptome data of highly aggressive grade 3 meningiomas. In vitro screening of 107 targeted drugs identified nine effective inhibitors. To study these drugs in a more natural environment, we established a standardized patient-derived tumor organoid (TO) model preserving accurately the original tissues genotype and phenotype. Individual drug responses were assessed in TOs from 60 molecularly characterized meningioma cases. Especially the FDA-approved epigenetic drug panobinostat demonstrated high antimeningioma efficacy in 70% of TOs, mediated through HDAC1/2 inhibition. In addition, treatment in an orthotopic in vivo model revealed a significantly improved survival. In a heavily pretreated patient suffering from an anaplastic meningioma, oral panobinostat treatment could delay the tumor growth rate. In search of the molecular mechanism underlying a potential intrinsic panobinostat resistance, we identified upregulation of the HDAC8-TGF{beta}-EMT axis in the TO model and subsequent HDAC8 depletion substantially increased the sensitivity to panobinostat. These data highlight the utility of personalized drug screenings on TOs to identify suitable drug targets and inhibitors for a more effective treatment of clinically aggressive meningiomas and help to advance our understanding of counteracting resistance mechanisms.

We analysed hundreds of tumours with paired whole-genome sequencing and total RNA sequencing to comprehensively characterise mitochondrial mutations and expression. Following de novo assembly of strain-specific mitochondrial genomes, we devised an accurate and efficient heteroplasmy detection approach and analysed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and transcription. Across strains, there was high concordance of the number of heteroplasmies, mutation signatures, and variant allele frequencies. In contrast, the heteroplasmy rate and genic locations differed between strains, suggesting strain-specificity in DNA repair mechanisms in early tumour development. Independent of age or environmental factors, tumours had lower mtDNA content than adjacent normal liver, suggesting mitochondrial loss during tumourigenesis. Additionally, within individual strains, mtDNA content differences were associated with nuclear driver gene choice.

Often, these resources overlap by assigning identifiers to the same or related concepts. This creates a data interoperability bottleneck, as integrating data sets and knowledge bases that use identifiers for the same concepts from different resources require such identifiers to be mapped to each other. However, available mappings are incomplete and fragmented across individual resources, motivating their large-scale integration.

ResultsWe developed SeMRA, a software tool that integrates mappings from multiple sources into a graph data structure. Using graph algorithms, it infers missing mappings implied by available ones while keeping track of provenance and confidence. This allows connecting identifier spaces between which direct mapping was previously not possible. SeMRA is customizable and takes a declarative specification as input describing sources to integrate with additional configuration parameters. We make available an aggregated mappings resource produced by SeMRA consisting of 43.4 million mappings from 127 sources that jointly cover identifiers from 445 ontologies and databases. We also describe benchmarks on specific use cases such as integrating mappings between resources cataloging diseases or cell types.

These macrophages accumulate excessive lipid droplets and become apoptotic ""foam cells"", a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Most studies focus on lipid accumulation through macrophage interaction with modified monomeric LDL. However, in the intima, macrophages predominantly encounter aggregated LDL (agLDL) species. Macrophages digest agLDL and generate free cholesterol in an extracellular, acidic, hydrolytic compartment. Macrophages form a tight seal around agLDL through actin polymerization and deliver lysosomal contents into this space in a process termed digestive exophagy. It is possible that partially inhibiting digestive exophagy to slow the delivery of cholesterol to the macrophages would protect macrophages from becoming foam cells and slow the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of digestive exophagy is critical. Here, we develop and perform a high-content microscopy screen on a library of repurposed drugs for compounds that inhibit lysosome exocytosis during digestive exophagy.

Cryptosporidium is an intracellular parasite of intestinal epithelial cells, and a leading cause of diarrheal death and disease in infants worldwide. Despite this, very little is known about the cell biology of infection of this eukaryotic pathogen. Here, we designed and implemented a unique microscopy-based arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 screen to interrogate the effects of the loss of every protein-coding human gene on a Cryptosporidium infection. As the experimental readout is image-based, we extracted multiple phenotypic features of infection, including parasite growth, progression of the parasite to its sexual life stage, and recruitment of host actin to  pedestals beneath the parasite vacuole. Using this dataset, we discovered a tipping point in the host cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that controls Cryptosporidium infection. Parasite growth can either be inhibited or promoted by the intermediary metabolite squalene. A build-up of squalene in epithelial cells creates a reducing environment, with more reduced host glutathione available for uptake by the parasite. Because Cryptosporidium has lost the ability to synthesise glutathione, this uptake from the host cell is required for growth and progression through its life cycle. We demonstrate that this dependency can be leveraged for treatment with the abandoned drug lapaquistat, an inhibitor of host squalene synthase that has efficacy against Cryptosporidium in vitro and in vivo.",NA,biorxiv

Cell and tissue features are not commonly used as chironomid markers to detect toxicity, but they could be extremely helpful in identifying acute and chronic effects of pollutants. The nervous system is an excellent cellular candidate since it is reactive to toxic substances. However, a detailed description of the chironomid nervous system is required prior to considering it as a candidate for a cellular toxicity marker. The present study describes the central ganglia, nerves, axons, and the neuromuscular system of Chironomus vitellinus (Freeman, 1961) to facilitate its use as a model organism in environmental studies. We find that the structure of the C. vitellinus central nervous system is identical to that observed in other Chironomus larvae. We then focused our study on the first abdominal segment and labeled the 31 hemi-segmental muscles according to a nomenclature based on their position and orientation. We also characterized their innervation and assigned the nerves a nomenclature based on their terminals location in the muscle tissue. Finally, we investigated the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) throughout this segment and defined four types of NMJs illustrating their great variability in size and shape. We selected a model NMJ, VEL 2, and quantified its mean bouton number and muscle size. Together with documenting a neurobiological system that could be informative to insects comparative biology, these results could help establish the Chironomus NMJ as an aquatic toxicity marker.",NA,biorxiv

Top-down projections from the ventrolateral OFC, but not other frontal areas, carried predictive signals that grew with daily sound experience and suppressed A1 via somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons.

We combine deep variational auto-encoders with computational modelling to construct a dynamical model of brain networks fitted to the whole-brain dynamics measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Crucially, this allows us to infer the interaction between these networks in resting state and 7 different cognitive tasks by determining the effective functional connectivity between networks.

Even though the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) provides recommendations for variant nomenclature, discrepancies in annotation remain a significant hurdle.

MethodsThis study evaluated the annotation concordance between three tools-- ANNOVAR, SnpEff, and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)--using 164,549 two-star variants from ClinVar. The analysis used HGVS nomenclature string-match comparisons to assess annotation consistency from each tool, corresponding coding impacts, and associated ACMG criteria inferred from the annotations.

ResultsThe analysis revealed variable concordance rates, with 58.52% agreement for HGVSc, 84.04% for HGVSp, and 85.58% for the coding impact. SnpEff showed the highest match for HGVSc (0.988), while VEP bettered for HGVSp (0.977). The substantial discrepancies were noted in the Loss-of-Function (LoF) category. Incorrect PVS1 interpretations affected the final pathogenicity and downgraded PLP variants (ANNOVAR 55.9%, SnpEff 66.5%, VEP 67.3%), risking false negatives of clinically relevant variants in reports.

ConclusionsThese findings highlight the critical challenges in accurately interpreting variant pathogenicity due to discrepancies in annotations. To enhance the reliability of genetic variant interpretation in clinical practice, standardizing transcript sets and systematically cross-validating results across multiple annotation tools is essential.

This study aimed to investigate these effects using a porcine model.

Experimental ApproachNaive and anti-PEG antibody-sensitized pigs were intravenously injected with Comirnaty. Acute anaphylactic responses were assessed through hemodynamic monitoring, hematological changes, and plasma inflammatory markers. Multiorgan inflammatory effects were evaluated by qPCR detection of spike protein (SP) mRNA uptake and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in seven organs over 6 hours. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were also performed.

Key ResultsSevere cardiopulmonary distress developed within minutes of repeated i.v. injections of Comirnaty. qPCR revealed predominant SP mRNA accumulation in liver and PBMCs, with spleen, kidney, lymph nodes, heart, and brain also affected in 40-90% of animals. Repetitive PBMC transfection showed reversible mRNA peaks at 15 minutes, followed by rapid decay. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1RA, CXCL10, TNF-, CCL2) paralleled mRNA uptake, suggesting a causal relationship. Cytokine profiles varied by organ (e.g. IL- 1RA in kidney, CCL2 in PBMCs). Histologic abnormalities and SP immunopositivity were noted in kidney, heart, and brain. Booster injections replicated PBMC transfection kinetics observed at first dose.

Conclusions and ImplicationsThis porcine model reveals systemic anaphylactic reactivity and multiorgan SP mRNA transfection following i.v. injection of mRNA-LNPs, resulting in organ-specific inflammatory responses. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the rare vaccine- related AEs and may support future efforts to improve the safety of the mRNA-LNP platform technology.",NA,biorxiv

To overcome this Bacillus dominance, we developed a novel agar medium containing leaf mold extract (LME) and assessed its utility for isolating microorganisms from soil samples. For comparison, conventional yeast malt extract agar (YME agar) was used as a control. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that colonies cultured on YME agar predominantly consisted of Bacillus-related bacteria, whereas LME agar enabled the growth of a wider variety of taxa, particularly actinomycetes such as Streptomyces. Notably, LME agar supported a higher diversity of soil bacterial isolates even from samples with a low abundance of Bacillus-related species. Among the 138 isolates recovered from LME agar, some either exhibited very low 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to known species in public databases, or failed to yield 16S rRNA amplicons with conventional universal primers, suggesting the presence of previously uncharacterized or novel taxa. Furthermore, one unidentified isolate failed to grow on standard nutrient media (YME, BHI, LB10, or TSB), but proliferated in liquid leaf mold extract, indicating a specific nutrient dependency. These findings demonstrate that LME agar can facilitate the isolation of a broader spectrum of soil microorganisms (including rare and previously uncultured species) not readily recoverable on common basal media. Incorporation of ecosystem-derived substrates into culture media may greatly enhance the discovery and study of novel microbial diversity from environmental samples.

ImportanceSoil contains a vast number of microorganisms, many of which remain undiscovered due to limitations in standard laboratory methods. A major issue is the overgrowth of Bacillus species on conventional media, which suppresses the growth of other bacteria. To address this, we developed a new agar medium using leaf mold extract (LME) and found it successfully supported the growth of a much wider variety of soil bacteria, including rare species. Some of the isolated microbes could not be identified using standard genetic tools, and one unique strain only grew in LME-based media, indicating a special nutrient requirement. These findings show that using natural environmental components like leaf mold can help scientists grow and study bacteria that were previously missed. This approach can expand our understanding of microbial diversity and may lead to the discovery of new microbes with potential applications in agriculture, medicine, or environmental science.",NA,biorxiv

To uncover the underlying mechanism, we studied the correlation between Rab4 vesicle transport in axons and episodic remodeling of synapses in the central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila larvae. We found that synapse-bound traffic and presynaptic enrichment of Rab4 vesicles increase during the programmed, transient contraction of synapses in the ventral neuropil region at a specific larval stage. This coincides with the episodic activation of insulin and Vps34-mediated signaling, which elevates phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate levels on Rab4 vesicles. The presence of this phospholipid on Rab4-associated vesicles recruit a PX-domain-containing motor protein, Klp98A, accelerating synapse-directed traffic. This, in turn, increases presynaptic enrichment of Rab4 during the developmentally programmed synapse contraction phase. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanism that regulates developmental synaptic plasticity in the CNS via insulin signaling and directed axonal transport of endosomes.

Author summaryHealthy brain function relies on the growth and remodeling of synaptic connections between nerve cells. This process involves carefully orchestrated movements of proteins and membranes inside the neurites. For instance, endosome movement in the nerve cell extensions helps guide neuronal growth, recycle parts of the synapse, and alter signal transmissions between neurons. Rab GTPases, a group of small G-proteins, are crucial for these processes. Here, we aimed to understand what triggers these processes and how the supply chain within nerve cell extensions is connected to changes at the synapse. In fruit fly larvae, we observed that the movement of Rab4 vesicles in the nerve cell extensions is inversely related to gross synapse content. A further examination revealed that onset of insulin signaling accelerates the Rab4 vesicles towards synapse through a lipid kinase called Vps34, which makes a signaling lipid called phospatidylinnositol-3-phosphate. Higher levels this lipid molecule on Rab4 vesicles attract a motor protein, Klp98A, speeding up their movement during the synaptic contraction phase. Our findings reveal a new mechanism that regulates Rab4 vesicle transport and its impact on synapse stability. The study further suggests potential targets for controlling age-related dementia likely to be caused by excessive insulin signaling in neurons.",NA,biorxiv

Rhesus macaque monkeys fixated a small spot while we presented either dark or bright image patches of different contrasts within the recorded neurons response fields. Besides replicating premicrosaccadic enhancement of visual sensitivity, we observed stronger enhancement for dark contrasts. This was especially true at moderate contrast levels (such as 10-20%), and it occurred independent of an individual neurons preference for either darks or brights. On the other hand, postmicrosaccadic visual sensitivity suppression was similar for either luminance polarity.

Several control architectures have been proposed for simulating locomotor tasks, based on fully feedback, reflex-based, controllers, or on feedforward architectures mimicking the Central Pattern Generators. Recently, hybrid architectures integrating both feedback and feedforward components have been shown to represent a viable alternative to fully feedback or feedforward controllers. Current literature on controller-based simulations, however, almost exclusively presents task-specific controllers that do not generalize across different tasks. The task-specificity of current controllers limits the generalizability of the neurophysiological principles behind such controllers. Here we propose a hybrid controller for predictive simulations of cycling based where the feedforward component is based on a well-known theoretical model, the Unit Burst Generation model, and the feedback component includes a limited set of reflex pathways, expected to be active during submaximal steady cycling. We show that this controller can simulate physiological cycling patterns at different desired speeds. We also show that the controller can generalize to walking behaviors by just adding an additional control component for accounting balance needs. The controller here proposed, although simple in design, represent an instance of physiologically inspired generalizable controller for cyclical lower limb tasks.

Author SummaryPredictive simulations allow to synthesize human movements and their associated biomechanical quantities without using experimental data. Such simulations can help understand how humans may perform movement tasks in different scenarios and could provide useful information in fields like rehabilitation. One of the methodologies used for developing predictive simulations is based on creating models of the neural control architectures that generate the activation of the muscles. In this work we propose the first neural control architecture for cycling behaviors. We show that our architecture can be used to develop predictive simulations of cycling at different speeds and that the associated biomechanical quantitites are consistent with experimental data. Moreover, we show that our control architecture can also replicate walking behaviors with minimal modifications.",NA,biorxiv

Upon therapy interruption, reactivation of the persistent HIV-1 reservoir propagates viral rebound and mediates continued immunological decline. While furthering understanding of the HIV-1 reservoir is essential for HIV-1 cure, commonly used sequencing strategies are often limited by the reliance on short-read sequencing across separate assays to determine integration sites and proviral integrity - something that does not always adequately resolve complex human genomic repeats or low complexity regions. Simultaneous identification of proviral integration sites and proviral integrity at the single molecule level would enable HIV-1 reservoir characterization with minimal imputation or bioinformatic reconstruction. Here we present HIV Single Molecule Real Time Capture (HIV SMRTcap), a novel molecular and computational pipeline that directly and simultaneously identifies HIV-1 integration sites, defines proviral integrity, and characterizes clonal expansion of HIV-1 provirus-containing cells with single molecule resolution. In combination with long-read, single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing and custom analytic pipelines, HIV SMRTcap enables a highly comprehensive characterization of HIV-1 reservoirs. Moreover, we demonstrate here that HIV SMRTcap performs robustly across the major global subtypes (HIV-1 subtype A, B, C, D and A/D recombinant viruses), and can use both cell- and tissue-derived inputs, including samples from antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals with undetectable viral loads. Our results demonstrate that HIV SMRTcap serves as a comprehensive, robust method for unbiased HIV-1 reservoir characterization.

In this work we sought to characterise metabolic adaptations to gemcitabine (GEMC)-based chemotherapy exposure to discover new therapeutic targets for improving treatment efficacy. We show that GEMC resistance (GEMR) upregulates de novo lipogenesis in Panc1 and MiaPaCa2 cells through increased activity and expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). We also discovered alternate fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) activity in Panc1 cells, which led to the production of sapienic acid (FA 16:1n-10, cis) from palmitic acid (FA 16:0). Knockdown of key lipid synthesis enzymes sensitised cells to GEMC treatment, with FAS (both cell lines), SCD1 (MiaPaCa2 only) and SCD1+FADS2 (Panc1) knockdown showing the greatest reduction in cell growth when combined with GEMC treatment. In Panc1 cells, both desaturases upregulated their activity when the alternate was knocked down, necessitating the need for dual desaturase knockdown in this cell line. PDAC cells attenuated to grow in combination GEMC/paclitaxel (CombAT) also displayed enhanced de novo lipogenesis; however, combination chemotherapy significantly downregulated FADS2 expression and activity in Panc1 CombAT cells rendering them more sensitive to SCD1 knockdown.

Here, we investigated whether differences in host gene expression modulate the size of the HIV-1 reservoir during suppressive ART. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from fourteen individuals initiating ART during acute infection who demonstrated effective viral suppression but varying magnitude of total HIV-1 DNA were characterized by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways demonstrated increased monocyte activity in participants with undetectable HIV-1 reservoirs. IL1B expression in CD14+ monocytes showed the greatest fold difference. The inverse association of IL1B with reservoir size was validated in an independent cohort comprised of 38 participants with different genetic backgrounds and HIV-1 subtype infections, and further confirmed with intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA(R)) measurements of intact HIV-1 proviruses in a subset of the samples. Modeling interactions with cell population frequencies showed that monocyte IL1B expression associated inversely with reservoir size in the context of higher frequencies of central memory CD4+ T cells, implicating an indirect effect of IL1B via the cell type well established to be a reservoir for persistent HIV-1. Signatures consisting of co-expressed genes including IL1B were highly enriched in the ""TNF signaling via NF-{kappa}B"" geneset. Functional analyses in cell culture revealed that IL1B activates NF-{kappa}B, thereby promoting productive HIV-1 infection while simultaneously suppressing viral spread, suggesting a natural latency reversing activity to deplete the reservoir in ART treated individuals. Altogether, unbiased high throughput scRNA-seq analyses revealed that monocyte IL1B variation could decrease HIV-1 proviral reservoirs in individuals initiating ART during acute infection.",NA,biorxiv

This function is critical for ciliary homeostasis maintenance of signaling proteins, allowing for successfully sensing and transducing extracellular stimuli inside the cell. It is established that, upon reaching the proximal ciliary region just above the transition zone (TZ), a diffusion barrier, via retrograde IFT, the BBSome, carrying signaling proteins, disengages from IFT and diffuses through the TZ for ciliary retrieval. This TZ passage event is promoted by the Arf-like 3 GTPase, which utilizes the BBSome autonomously of IFT association as its major effector. While it is known that the intact BBSome is recruited to the basal bodies before entering cilia, the precise mechanism by which it crosses the TZ to access cilia remains elusive. In our study on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we disclose that the Ras-associated binding (Rab) GTPase RAB18 is concentrated in a basal body region that overlaps with the BBSome. Positioned at this location, RAB18 in a GTP-bound state (RAB18-GTP) is anchored to the membrane, allowing it to diffuse into cilia. Throughout this process, the BBSome functions as a RAB18 effector, binding to RAB18-GTP and subsequently being recruited to diffuse through the TZ for ciliary entry in an IFT-independent manner. This collaboration between the BBSome and RAB18 is pivotal in maintaining the signaling protein phospholipase D ciliary homeostasis, providing a precise mechanistic understanding of the inward BBSome TZ passage essential for proper ciliary signaling.

Significance statementAlthough certain ciliary signaling proteins cross the transition zone (TZ) for ciliary removal via the RABL2-ARL3 module-mediated outward BBSome TZ diffusion pathway, how the BBSome passes the TZ for ciliary entry remains unclear. Here, we show that RAB18, in its GTP-bound state, anchors to the membrane at the basal bodies. As a RAB18 effector, the BBSome is recruited to cross the TZ for ciliary entry via lateral transport between plasma and ciliary membranes. Once inside cilia, the BBSome integrates into anterograde IFT trains and subsequently functions as a phospholipase D (PLD) adaptor, ensuring PLD removal from cilia. This study highlights RAB18s pivotal role in facilitating BBSome entry into cilia, unveiling a regulatory mechanism crucial for maintaining ciliary signaling protein homeostasis.",NA,biorxiv

While highly sensitive to habitat destruction and land use change, bats have shown adaptability in human-modified landscapes. This study investigates the impact of urbanisation on the endemic Reunion free-tailed bat (Mormopterus francoismoutoui), which roosts in a variety of rapidly urbanised habitats. We analysed 412 urine samples from 11 roosts across Reunion Island, covering a gradient of urban and agricultural land use. We measured urinary cortisol, microbiome diversity and the shedding of Leptospira bacteria and paramyxovirus. After accounting for natural cortisol level variations due to circadian rhythm, age, sex, reproduction and capture-induced stress, we found that bats roosting in agricultural and urban areas were in better condition and had lower cortisol levels, suggesting adaptation to human-modified landscapes. Less-stressed bats had more diverse urinary microbiomes and reduced pathogen shedding, suggesting that landscape modifications may indirectly alter the natural epidemiology of bat-borne infectious agents. These patterns were particularly pronounced in females, supporting sex-dependent plasticity to urbanisation in bats. Our study highlights how rapid urbanisation may elicit plastic responses in bats, with potential cascading effects on zoonotic risk of transmission.",NA,biorxiv

Hi-SMdM employs a self-supervised deep-learning denoising framework with a general noise model to effectively restore the scarce signals of fast-moving single molecules, while eliminating artifact motions without relying on spatial redundancies or temporal correlations. It then provides unbiased estimations of nanoscale diffusion coefficient and improve both throughput and temporal resolution by up to an order of magnitude. We demonstrate the versatility of Hi-SMdM through time-resolved mapping of the spatially heterogeneous diffusivity of free proteins in the cytoplasm.

Here, we explore some ways that a sublinear predator-prey scaling could emerge from density-dependent interactions among predators and between predators and prey (which we call a top-down origin), rather than among prey (bottom-up origin) as proposed in Hatton et al.

First, we use phenomenological differential equations to explore the role of environmental parameters and dynamical properties in controlling the predator-prey ratio. Second, we simulate an agent-based model with tunable predator self-regulation to investigate the emergence of predator-prey scaling from plausible microscopic rules. While we cannot rule out alternative explanations, our results show that density-dependent mechanisms relative to predation and intraspecific predator interactions, including prey saturation, predator interference, and predator self-regulation, offer potential explanations for the predator-prey power law.",NA,biorxiv

As these animals glide from tree to tree in a habitat abundant with smooth-bark trees, we hypothesize that the scaly-tail organ assists with friction enhancement in their native smooth-bark habitat. Through a combination of analyses using mathematical and physical models for experimental validation, we explore whether the scaly-tail organ could improve the sliding and overturning stability during perching. Our experimental results showed that the scaly-tail organ can act as a skid-reduction mechanism by enhancing substrate engagement on intermediate roughness substrates by 58%. Mathematical models showed the scaly-tail organ enhances overturning stability by acting as an additional support point. Our model showed that the scaly-tailed squirrel can reach up to 82.5o inclination without claw force; however, without scales, it reduces to 79.6o.

Mice readily learned this task, and their performance was well-described by widely used decision models. Logistic regression of binary choices against the timing of odor pulses within the respiratory cycle revealed that mice placed higher perceptual weight to stimuli arriving during inhalation than exhalation, a phase dependency that strongly correlated with the magnitude of responses in olfactory sensory neurons. The population response of anterior piriform cortex (APCx) neurons to odor pulses was also modulated by respiration phase, although individual neurons displayed varying levels of phase-dependence. Single APCx neurons responded stochastically and transiently to odor pulses, leading to a representation that carries signatures of sensory evidence, but not its accumulation.

We identified more than 200 amino acid substitutions along the lineage that lead to placental mammals, with early substitutions concentrated in the transmembrane domain (TMD) and late substitutions clustering in the STAS domain, particularly in the intervening sequence (IVS). Structural modeling revealed that early substitutions modulate protein-lipid interactions and interhelical contacts. In placental mammals, the IVS-loop adopts a distinct conformation that places a negatively charged patch near the chloride access pathway, potentially affecting the ion dynamics and voltage responsiveness. These structural transitions occurred without major rearrangements of the global fold of prestin, supporting a notion in which the novel function evolved through distributed substitutions within a conserved scaffold.

Transferred Starships are recovered in strains with and without selection for particular Starship-encoded phenotypes. Using whole genome sequencing, we exclude alternative hypotheses such as heterokaryosis, parasex or the random uptake of exogenous DNA by showing that only Starship DNA is precisely transferred.

A promising set of newer approaches are based on genetic data, which can be cheaper to obtain and less invasive than information from more direct observation. One of these approaches is close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR), a type of method that uses genetic data to identify kin pairs and estimates population size from these pairs. Although CKMR methods are promising, a major limitation to using them more broadly is a lack of CKMR models that can deal with spatial heterogeneity both in population density and sample effort. We introduce a simulation-based approach to CKMR that uses spatially explicit individual-based simulation in concert with a deep convolutional neural network to estimate population sizes. Using extensive simulation, we show that our method, CKMRnn, is highly accurate, even in the face of spatial heterogeneity, and demonstrate that it can account for potential confounders such as unknown population histories. Finally, to demonstrate the accuracy of our method in an empirical system, we apply CKMRnn to data from a Ugandan elephant population, and show that point estimates from our method recapitulate those from traditional estimators but that the confidence interval on our estimator is reduced by approximately 30%.",NA,biorxiv

Previously, we used scRNA-Seq to characterize the cutaneous immune response in the EM lesion, focusing on B cells. Here, with an expanded sample size, we profiled T cell responses in EM lesions compared to autologous uninvolved skin. In addition to CD4+ T cell subsets known to be abundant in the EM, we identified clonal expansion of CD8+ GZMK+ IFNG+ T cells that exhibited significant differential expression of interferon-regulated genes. This subset included IFNG+ cells with low cytotoxic gene expression, which may promote inflammation. While FOXP3+ regulatory T cells were also increased in EM, they exhibited little IL10 expression. In contrast, a CD4+ FOXP3- tissue-resident T cell subset contained the largest population of cells with IL10 expression. Fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and pericytes were the principal cells that significantly differentially expressed key T cell-recruiting chemokines. These studies represent the first comprehensive interrogation of the cutaneous T cell response to Bb infection using single cell transcriptomics with adaptive immune receptor sequencing, providing insight into the skin barrier defense and orchestration of the immune response to this vector-borne pathogen.",NA,biorxiv

While previous studies focused on group-level differences, connectome-based brain fingerprinting enables deeper, individualized analysis of neural change. Applying this approach to PD patients with and without MH using resting-state fMRI, we show that each patient exhibited unique brain fingerprint, revealing rich quantifiable personalized features with medical relevance. MH-patients showed a loss of subject-specific features in brain networks linked to cognitive health, while somatosensory regions - typically less distinctive - became more prominent, emphasizing their role in MH pathogenesis. These differences enabled to identify - in an entirely data driven manner - patient-specific networks linked to early subclinical cognitive alterations, as well differential spatial fingerprinting organization linked to cortical densities of neurotransmitters.

We use DeepProfile to learn low-dimensional latent spaces for 18 human cancers from 50,211 transcriptomes. DeepProfile outperforms existing dimensionality reduction methods with respect to biological interpretability. Using DeepProfile interpretability methods, we show that genes that are universally important in defining the latent spaces across all cancer types control immune cell activation, while cancer type-specific genes and pathways define molecular disease subtypes. By linking DeepProfile latent variables to secondary tumor characteristics, we discover that tumor mutation burden is closely associated with the expression of cell cycle-related genes. DNA mismatch repair and MHC class II antigen presentation pathway expression, on the other hand, are consistently associated with patient survival. We validate these results through Kaplan-Meier analyses and nominate tumor-associated macrophages as an important source of survival-correlated MHC class II transcripts.

Reaction dynamics in cell populations is often noisy because of (i) inherent stochasticity of intracellular biochemical reactions (""intrinsic noise"") and (ii) heterogeneity of cellular states across different cells that are influenced by external factors (""extrinsic noise""). In this work, we introduce an extrinsic-noise-driven neural stochastic differential equation (END-nSDE) framework that utilizes the Wasserstein distance to accurately reconstruct SDEs from trajectory data from a heterogeneous population of cells (extrinsic noise). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and experimental data from three different systems in cell biology: (i) circadian rhythms, (ii) RPA-DNA binding dynamics, and (iii) NF{kappa}B signaling process. Our END-nSDE reconstruction method can model how cellular heterogeneity (extrinsic noise) modulates reaction dynamics in the presence of intrinsic noise. It also outperforms existing time-series analysis methods such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs).

In this study, we performed both spatial and single-nuclei transcriptomic experiments to capture the spatial pattern of soybean plant responses to Asian soybean rust infection caused by the pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi. Through the analysis of both spatial and single-nuclei transcriptomics data, we identified two distinct host cell states with specific spatial localization in response to pathogen infection: the infected regions with the presence of the pathogen and the surrounding regions bordering the infected regions. Importantly, the surrounding regions exhibited higher expression of defense response-related genes than the infected regions, despite having minimal presence of the pathogen, indicating a cell non-autonomous defense response in the surrounding regions. Additionally, gene co-expression network analysis with single-cell resolution identified a key immune response-related gene module activated in the stressed cells captured in our single-nuclei RNA-seq data.

Using generalized models, we derive conditions for the onset of different dynamical behaviors in communities of bacterial cooperators across these scenarios. These include exchanges of low-cost metabolites, costly cross-feeding, and cases where bacteria produce either most or only a small fraction of available metabolites. Stability depends strongly on metabolic production costs and the balance between metabolite uptake and production.

Here, we performed a phylostratigraphic tracking of glycosylation machinery genes and their targets -- glycosylated proteins -- in a broad phylogenetic context. Our results show that the vast majority of human glycosylation machinery genes trace back to two evolutionary periods: the origin of all cellular organisms and the origin of all eukaryotes. This indicates that protein glycosylation is an ancient process likely common to all life, further elaborated in early eukaryotes. In contrast, human glycoproteins exhibited prominent enrichment signals in more recent evolutionary periods, suggesting an important role in the transition from metazoans to vertebrates. Focusing specifically on the N-glycosylation pathway, we noted that the majority of N-glycosylation genes acting on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) trace back to the origin of cellular organisms. This sharply contrasts with the rest of the N-glycosylation pathway, which is oriented toward the ER lumen, where genes of eukaryotic origin predominate. In the Golgi, we also identified an analogous binary evolutionary origin of glycosylation machinery genes.

One potential alternative to large-scale benchtop experiments for collecting training data is high-throughput molecular dynam-ics simulation; however, to date this source of data has been largely absent from the literature.

I demonstrate that this approach can obtain very highly optimized variants based on small amounts of experimental data, greatly outperforming machine learning-guided directed evolution with the same amount of experimental data. Furthermore, I show that quantified dynamics-property relationships based on only a handful of experimentally labeled example sequences can be used to accurately predict the key residues that are most relevant to determining the property in question, even when that information could not have been known or predicted based on either the molecular dynamics simulations or the experimental data alone.

By comparing ectopic alveolar to ""classical"" airway BC, we aimed to get a better understanding of the origin and characteristics of alveolar BC in ILD.

MethodsAlveolar and airway BC were isolated from transbronchial and airway mucosal biopsies, respectively, from the same ILD patients and expanded in culture. Samples were analyzed by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), TaqMan RT-PCR, and immunochemistry.

ResultsscRNA-seq analysis revealed several differences in gene expression that suggested a shift to a more mesenchymal-like phenotype and a decrease in keratinization genes in alveolar compared to airway BC. Specific AT2 cell marker genes were not expressed in either BC type. While the morphology, wound repair and proliferation capacities of BC from both origins were not significantly different, alveolar BC formed significantly fewer organoids, expressing more MUC5B.

ConclusionDespite similar overall functionality in vitro and after instillation into bleomycin-injured mice, alveolar and airway BC differed in their transcriptomes and in their capacities to form and to differentiate in organoids. Our data provide no evidence to support their potential derivation from AT2 cells.

In Escherichia coli, the initiator protein DnaA constructs a higher-order initiation complex at the origin oriC which locally unwinds the DNA, and recruits DnaB helicase-DnaC loader complexes to the unwound region. We previously demonstrated that the two DnaA subcomplexes formed on oriC bind a specific DNA strand of the unwound origin, and tether individual DnaB-DnaC complexes via stable interactions between DnaA domain I and DnaB. A low-affinity DnaA-DnaB interaction mediated by DnaA domain III His136 is essential for DnaB-dependent origin unwinding. Here, we identified DnaB Thr86 as the critical residue mediating this low-affinity interaction. Structural modelling suggests that Thr86 is surface-exposed near the DNA entry site of DnaB. Functional analyses revealed that DnaB Thr86 was specifically required for DnaB loading onto the DnaA-bound strand of the unwound oriC. Furthermore, this strand-specific DnaB loading was required for enabling translocation of the opposing DnaB helicase loaded on the DnaA-free strand. Our findings define a novel regulatory mechanism of strand-specific helicase loading, mediated by the low-affinity DnaA-DnaB interactions, which ensures the coordinated loading and translocation of DnaB helicases for bidirectional replication from oriC.",NA,biorxiv

Non-physiological microbiota-depletion or induced gut infection in animal models, have been instrumental to link intestinal alterations to cognitive and mood dysfunctions. However, the effects of specific, controlled, physiologically relevant shifts in commensal microbiota composition on brain function remain poorly understood.

METHODSMice deficient in galectin-4 (Lgals4-KO) were used in this study. Gut microbiota was analysed by 16S-rRNA sequencing. Cognitive and mood status were evaluated with specific behavioral tests. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was tested ex vivo and in vivo by electrophysiological methods and in vitro by immunofluorescence and western blot. RNA-sequencing was used for transcriptomic analyses. Golgi-Cox staining and transmission electron microscopy were used for quantitative and morphological assessments of dendritic spines and synapses.

RESULTSLgals4-KO mice present an altered intestinal commensal microbiota in the absence of pathogens, deficient memory formation, and impaired hippocampal LTP in vivo and ex vivo. Furthermore, Lgals4-KO neurons show a reduced activation of AMPA receptors and of CaMKII upon chemically induced LTP in vitro. These mice also display significantly lower dendritic spine density and shorter spine length in hippocampal dendrites, as well as an increased area of the postsynaptic densities

CONCLUSIONSOur results define a new role for galectin-4 in the modulation of commensal bacteria. We also show that the absence of galectin-4 induces changes in gut microbial composition, along with synaptic alterations and memory impairment, supporting our hypothesis that variations in endogenous microbiota may cause or contribute to relevant neurological pathologies.",NA,biorxiv

Monopolar spindle 1 (MPS1) is a mitotic kinase that plays a pivotal role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). GBM appears to be dependent on SAC fidelity, as MPS1 is overexpressed in many GBM patients. Thus, inhibiting MPS1 seems a viable therapeutic strategy to enhance mitotic cell death by attenuating SAC fidelity. NTRC 0066-0 is an MPS1 inhibitor that combines low nanomolar potency with a relatively long on-target residence time.

MethodsWe here investigate the potential of NTRC 0066-0 as monotherapy and in combination with chemo-radiation for treatment of GBM using various in vitro and orthotopic in vivo models.

ResultsWe show that NTRC 0066-0 efficiently induces GBM cell death in vitro, following continuous exposure with IC50s in the low nanomolar range. In contrast to previous reports of studies with other MPS1 inhibitors, we did not observe synergy in vitro with anti-microtubule drugs, such as docetaxel and vincristine. We demonstrate that NTRC 0066-0 has a high brain penetration, despite being a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. However, even when using recipient Abcb1a/b;Abcg2-/- mice with superior brain penetration and administering NTRC 0066-0 using a dose-dense regimen, we did not observe antitumor efficacy against an orthotopic GBM mouse model, neither as monotherapy nor in combination with standard-of-care temozolomide chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

ConclusionThese data indicate that GBM is probably not a suitable indication for developing MPS1 inhibitors.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we propose to restore data balance through data augmentation using generative unsupervised models. We then use these augmented data to train supervised models for prediction of peptide-specific T cell receptors, or binding pairs of peptide and T cell receptor sequences.

The mechanisms controlling chromosome attachments and the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) have been extensively studied in meiosis I, but our knowledge of these mechanisms during meiosis II is rather limited. Although mammalian oocytes arrest in metaphase II for an extended period awaiting fertilization, some misattached chromosomes may persist. This suggests that the mechanism correcting misattachments is not fully functional during the arrest. In this study, we investigated whether low inter-kinetochore tension, which characterizes incorrect attachments, can be detected by Aurora B/C-dependent error correction in meiosis II. We found that low tension in early metaphase II does indeed mediate microtubule detachment by Aurora B/C and consequently, anaphase II delay through SAC activation. Surprisingly, we also found that during prolonged metaphase II arrest, Aurora B/C activity is no longer sufficient to detach low-tension attachments, concomitantly with high accumulation of PP2A at kinetochores. As a result, the SAC is not activated and sister chromatids segregate in anaphase II without delay even in the presence of low tension. Hence, during the prolonged metaphase II arrest to await fertilization, oocytes become unable to discriminate between correct and incorrect attachments and may allow errors to persist.",10.1016/j.cub.2025.03.030,biorxiv

The variability underlying these inter-individual correlations is generally attributed to factors such as genetics, life experiences, and long-term influences like aging. This study leveraged two unique longitudinal datasets to examine intra-individual correlations of structural and functional brain measures across an extended time span. By focusing on intra-individual correlations, we aimed to minimize individual differences and investigate how aging and state-like effects contribute to brain connectivity patterns. Additionally, we compared intra-individual correlations with inter-individual correlations to better understand their relationship. In the first dataset, which included repeated scans from a single individual over 15 years, we found that intra-individual correlations in both regional homogeneity (ReHo) during resting-state and gray matter volumes (GMV) from structural MRI closely resembled resting-state functional connectivity. However, ReHo correlations were primarily driven by state-like variability, whereas GMV correlations were mainly influenced by aging. The second dataset, comprising multiple participants with longitudinal Fludeoxyglucose (18F) FDG-PET and MRI scans, replicated these findings. Both intra- and inter-individual correlations were strongly associated with resting-state functional connectivity, with functional measures (i.e., ReHo and FDG-PET) exhibiting greater similarity to resting-state connectivity than structural measures. This study demonstrated that controlling for various factors can enhance the interpretability of brain correlation structures. While inter- and intra-individual correlation patterns showed similarities, accounting for additional variables may improve our understanding of inter-individual connectivity measures.",NA,biorxiv

Using highly accurate assemblies generated from long-read sequencing as part of the human pangenome, we completely characterize 169 human haplotypes (4,665 NPIP paralogs and alleles). Of the 28 NPIP paralogs, just three (NPIPB2, B11, and B14) are fixed at a single copy, and only a single locus, B2, shows no structural variation. Four NPIP paralogs map to large segmental duplication blocks that mediate polymorphic inversions (355 kbp-1.6 Mbp) corresponding to microdeletions associated with developmental delay and autism. Haplotype-based tests of positive selection and selective sweeps identify two paralogs, B9 and B15, within the top percentile for both tests.

In this study, we designed three geometrical invariants with varying levels of stability for VPL: projective (e.g., collinearity), affine (e.g., parallelism), and Euclidean (e.g., orientation) invariants, following the Kleins Erlangen program. We found that learning to discriminate low-stability invariant transferred asymmetrically to those with higher stability, and that training on high-stability invariants enabled location transfer. To explore learning-associated plasticity in the visual hierarchy, we trained deep neural networks (DNNs) to model this learning procedure. We reproduced the asymmetric transfer between different invariants in DNN simulations and found that the distribution and time course of plasticity in DNNs suggested a neural mechanism similar to the reverse hierarchical theory (RHT), yet distinct in that invariant stability--not task difficulty or precision--emerged as the key determinant of learning and generalization.

During development, DNA content remains constant but cell size evolves, necessitating a mechanism that scales chromosome compaction with cell size. In this study, we examined chromatin compaction in the developing Drosophila nervous system by analyzing the large neuronal stem cells and their smaller progeny, the ganglion mother cells. Using super-resolution 3D Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy and quantitative time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we observed that nanoscale chromatin density during interphase scales with nuclear volume according to a power law. This scaling relationship is disrupted by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity, indicating that molecular cues rather than mechanical constraints primarily regulate chromatin compaction. Notably, this power law dependency is maintained into mitosis but the scaling exponent decreases, suggesting phase separation of chromatin events during mitotic compaction. We propose that the scaling of mitotic chromosome size relative to cell size depends on the power law behaviour of interphase chromatin volume, and that scaling of mitotic chromatin compaction is an emergent property of linear polymers undergoing phase separation with their solvent.

Statement of SignificanceUnderstanding how chromatin compaction changes with cell size is essential for understanding the mechanisms ensuring accurate genome segregation during cell division. In this study, we combine Voronoi tessellation analysis of Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy and image processing methods based on fluorescence intensity spectrum analysis of live confocal images to measure chromatin volume in interphase and mitosis in cells of different sizes. This work reveals that chromatin density in Drosophila neuronal cells follows a power law relationship with nuclear volume from interphase through mitosis, suggesting a fundamental principle underlying chromosome scaling across different cell sizes. We show that this scaling is regulated by molecular cues, such as histone deacetylase activity, and is conserved through a potential phase separation during mitosis, providing new insights into the biophysical processes that govern chromatin organization. This work broadens our understanding of chromosome biology and will have implications for understanding size-dependent chromatin dynamics in other organisms.",NA,biorxiv

These changes likely result from and give insight into the reorganization within spared and injured spinal circuitry. Previously, we developed computational models of the mouse spinal locomotor circuitry controlling speed-dependent gait expression (Danner et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2022). Here, we adapted these models to the rat and used the adapted model to explore potential circuit-level changes underlying altered gait expression observed after recovery from two different thoracic spinal cord injuries (lateral hemisection and contusion) that have roughly comparable levels of locomotor recovery (Danner et al., 2023). The model reproduced experimentally observed gait expression before injury and after recovery from lateral hemisection and contusion, and suggests two distinct, injury-specific mechanisms of recovery. First, recovery after lateral hemisection required substantial functional restoration of damaged descending drive and long propriospinal connections, suggesting compensatory plasticity through formation of detour pathways. Second, recovery after a moderate midline contusion predominantly relied on reorganization of spared sublesional networks and altered control of supralesional cervical circuits, compensating for weakened propriospinal and descending pathways. These observations suggest that symmetrical (contusion) and asymmetrical (lateral hemisection) injuries induce distinct types of plasticity in different regions of the spinal cord, indicating that effective therapeutic strategies may benefit from targeting specific circuits according to injury symmetry.",NA,biorxiv

A natural theoretical question is how to formalize the computational problem of building an optimal pangenome graph, making explicit the underlying optimization criterion and the set of feasible solutions. Current approaches build a pangenome graph with some heuristics, without assuming some explicit optimization criteria. Thus it is unclear how a specific optimization criterion affects the graph topology and downstream analysis, like read mapping and variant calling.

MethodsIn this paper, by leveraging the notion of maximal block in a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), we reframe the pangenome graph construction problem as an exact cover problem on blocks called Minimum Weighted Block Cover (MWBC). Then we propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for the MWBC problem that allows us to study the most natural objective functions for building a graph.

ResultsWe provide an implementation of the ILP approach for solving the MWBC and we evaluate it on SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes, showing how different objective functions lead to pangenome graphs that have different properties, hinting that the specific downstream task can drive the graph construction phase.

ConclusionWe show that a customized construction of a pangenome graph based on selecting objective functions has a direct impact on the resulting graphs. In particular, our formalization of the MWBC problem, based on finding an optimal subset of blocks covering an MSA, paves the way to novel practical approaches to graph representations of an MSA where the user can guide the construction.",NA,biorxiv

This study demonstrates that the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is a crucial regulator of airway epithelial cell survival and homeostasis in Drosophila melanogaster. Our findings reveal that JAK/STAT activity is continuously required throughout development and adulthood, with environmental factors like cigarette smoke and hypoxia further intensifying pathway activation. Disrupting JAK/STAT signaling in airway epithelia during development is lethal, triggers apoptosis, and in adults, reduces lifespan while increasing vulnerability to chronic smoke exposure. Conversely, chronic hyperactivation of JAK/STAT signaling induces significant cell-autonomous epithelial remodeling, evidenced by epithelial thickening, tracheal narrowing, and impaired barrier structure, mirroring the pathological features of chronic lung disease. Pharmacological inhibition of this pathway effectively reverses these defects. Comprehensive transcriptomic analyses further reveal that maintaining a balance in JAK/STAT signaling is essential for preserving cellular junctions and secretory functions. These findings underscore the importance of tightly regulated JAK/STAT signaling for the integrity of airway epithelium and present a valuable in vivo model for exploring the mechanisms underlying inflammatory lung diseases and for preclinical drug testing.

HighlightsO_LIJAK/STAT signaling is active throughout the entire Drosophila respiratory system during all developmental stages.
C_LIO_LIThe signaling pathway is indispensable for the survival of the tracheal cell.
C_LIO_LIOveractivation of the signaling profoundly impacts tracheal development and exhibits a phenotype associated with human diseases in the Drosophila trachea.

However, learning-induced performance improvements are often limited to the specific stimuli and visual field locations used during training. Recent research has shown that variability along task-irrelevant stimulus dimensions during training can reduce this specificity. This has been related to higher stages of visual processing that harbor neurons which are invariant to the task-irrelevant dimension. Here, we test whether task-irrelevant trial-by-trial variability in two visual features for which invariances arise at different stages of processing, contrast and spatial phase, results in different degrees of generalization in space in an orientation discrimination task. We find that randomizing spatial phase results in complete generalization of learning to a new spatial location, contrary to randomizing contrast. Our results thus suggest that the neural population undergoing plasticity in visual perceptual learning is determined by the training task, which, in turn, affects generalization. This lends further support to the hypothesis that task-irrelevant variability is an independent factor in determining the specificity of perceptual learning.",10.1007/s41465-025-00329-1,biorxiv

Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is a major cereal crop, but suffers significant yield losses due to pathogen attack every year. Here we use an untargeted metabolomic approach to assess the diversity and shifts in key barley metabolites produced in response to Pyrenophora teres f. teres infection, a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen and causal agent of net blotch disease. Tryptophan-derived compounds, including tryptamine, serotonin, and a novel indole alkaloid - 2-oxo-tryptamine (2OT) - were among the most significantly induced and abundant compounds, with mass spectrometry imaging revealing that these metabolites accumulate at the site of infection. A transcriptomic approach identified a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO), which was functionally characterized as a 2-oxo-tryptamine synthase (2OTS). In addition, a cytochrome P450 (CYP71P10) was characterized as a tryptamine-5-hydroxylase, responsible for serotonin biosynthesis. These characterized genes are tightly co-expressed with genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis and signify a major metabolic flux towards indolic compounds after infection, potentially serving as bioactive phytoalexins. Additional microbial interactions using a biotrophic fungus (Blumeria hordei; powdery mildew), a hemibiotrophic bacterium (Pseudomonas syringae), and alternative cultivars suggest that these pathways represent a generally activated resistance response in barley.

For plasmid sequence verification using next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation, Tn5 transposase is widely used. Streamlined sequencing workflow for laboratory-scale applications is important; however, recombinant Tn5 production in-house can be laborious. In this study, we demonstrated that the addition of a large soluble tag was not essential for purification and that the fusion of a His10 tag and protein A was sufficient to purify sufficient amounts of active Tn5 transposase. In addition, we evaluated exonuclease-based genomic DNA digestion for plasmid sequencing from an E. coli lysate and the data analysis pipeline of sequences derived from the Illumina iSeq100 platform for de novo assembly, reference mapping, and annotation.

Efficient methods to design complex perturbation patterns are ur- gently needed. Can we design a spatiotemporal pattern of stimulation to steer neural activity and behavior towards a desired target? We outline a method for achieving this goal in two steps. First, we identify the most effective perturbation sites, or hubs, only based on short observations of spontaneous neural activity.

Many de novo approaches leverage deep learning but primarily focus on the architecture of neural networks, paying less attention to search algorithms.

There is still much to be learn what kind of information birds are interested and capable of gathering from conspecifics in the foraging context. We set out to test the social learning skills of a granivorous gregarious species of cardueline finch, the Serin (Serinus serinus), because they likely follow conspecifics cues to forage. We used an observer-demonstrator paradigm where observers were given the opportunity to learn to reach hidden food from observation of demonstrators that were previously trained to perform the task. Almost half of the birds tested were capable of learning (40%) from a conspecific in a colour-food association experiment, and learners were able to remember the association after fifteen days. Also, almost half of the birds tested for this revealed to be capable of reversal learning. The ability to learn was not influenced by sex or age, of both demonstrators and learners, but learners had longer wings than non-learners. We investigated whether personality could explain the differences in learning ability of these birds.

This allows one to gain functional insights into gene expression paving the way for a better understanding of the molecular risk mechanisms of conditions, such as ADHD. In this study, we performed transcriptome profiling of highly homogeneous dopamine neurons developed from induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) that were derived from an individual with ADHD and a neurotypical comparison individual. Comparative gene expression analysis between the examined lines revealed that the top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predominantly associated with nervous system functions related to neuronal development and dopaminergic regulation. Notably, 29 of the DEGs overlapped with those identified by ADHD-GWAS meta- analysis. These genes are overrepresented in biological processes including developmental growth regulation, axonogenesis, and nervous system development. In addition, gene set analysis revealed significant enrichment for meta categories such as ion channel activity, synaptic function and assembly, neuronal development and cell differentiation. Further, we observed significantly reduced projections in the ADHD dopamine neurons at the mid- differentiation stage (day 14 in vitro), providing preliminary support for the delayed neuronal maturation hypotheses of ADHD.

Here, we aimed to explore possible mechanisms contributing to these changes within the microbiome-gut-brain axis, and whether it preceded or followed central neurodegeneration. Here, we report that pre-symptomatic male MJD mice present with significantly different microbiome communities as early as 5-weeks-old. Furthermore, we show that male MJD mice have faster total gut transit times by 9-weeks-old, prior to signs of impaired motor function by 11-weeks-old. To elucidate whether these microbial and colonic functional changes are due to the presence of pathological and morphological changes in the gut, we quantified the formation of ataxin-3 protein aggregates within the gut and examined morphological changes within the gut of pre- and early symptomatic MJD mice relative to proteinopathy in the brain. Interestingly, we observed ataxin-3 aggregates within the brains of pre-symptomatic MJD mice, with significantly more aggregates present in MJD than WT mice from 7-weeks-of-age, an earlier timepoint than previously reported, coinciding with changes within the microbiome. However, we observed no ataxin-3 protein aggregates and no changes in enteric neuron populations or morphology within the gut. Analysis of endocrine factors involved in gut motility and inflammatory markers within the small intestine of 13-week-old males revealed increased expression of genes encoding cholecystokinin (Cck), ghrelin (Ghrl), heme oxygenase (Ho1), interleukin-1 beta (Il1b), and decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2). Together, we demonstrate for the first time that colonic dysfunction occurs after gut microbiome changes, but prior to the onset of motor impairments in male MJD mice. Our work suggests that whilst proteinopathy or morphological changes within the gut may not be involved in these changes, inflammation and related endocrine changes could have a role in the interplay between the gut and brain during MJD development, warranting further investigation.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we describe two orthogonal induced-proximity strategies to identify and prioritize autophagy effectors that are sufficient to degrade organelles as well as soluble targets. We show that induced proximity of different effectors such as autophagy cargo receptors, ATG8-like proteins or the kinases ULK1 and TBK1 are sufficient to trigger mitophagy. In contrast, self-oligomerizing autophagy cargo receptors outperform ATG8- like effectors and autophagy-related kinases in clearing a soluble cytosolic protein. We further explore the importance of avidity for targeted degradation via autophagy and reveal that the PB1 domain of p62 fused to a LIR peptide is a minimal degron to induce the degradation of mitochondria as well as cytosolic proteins. By developing a novel and highly selective intrabody against the autophagy cargo receptor p62 into a heterobifunctional degrader, we demonstrate that recruitment of endogenous p62 is sufficient to clear mitochondria. This biodegrader, however, is unable to induce degradation of soluble cytosolic proteins due to its inhibitory effect on p62 self-oligomerization.

Using both simulated datasets and real genomic datasets, we firmly conclude that the SAT-based method scales much better and runs faster than using ILP, being able to solve a whole new range of instances which the ILP-based method cannot solve in a reasonable amount of time. This underscores the SAT-based approach as a versatile and more powerful alternative to ILP, with promising implications for broader applications in computational biology.",NA,biorxiv

Structured regions in RNA can selectively interact with small molecules - via well-defined ligand binding pockets - to modulate the regulatory repertoire of an RNA. The broad potential to modulate biological function intentionally via RNA-ligand interactions remains unrealized, however, due to challenges in identifying compact RNA motifs with the ability to bind ligands with good physicochemical properties (often termed drug-like). Here, we devise fpocketR, a computational strategy that accurately detects pockets capable of binding drug-like ligands in RNA structures. Remarkably few, roughly 50, of such pockets have ever been visualized. We experimentally confirmed the ligandability of novel pockets detected with fpocketR using a fragment-based approach introduced here, Frag-MaP, that detects ligand-binding sites in cells. Analysis of pockets detected by fpocketR and validated by Frag-MaP reveals dozens of newly identified sites able to bind drug-like ligands, supports a model for RNA secondary structural motifs able to bind quality ligands, and creates a broad framework for understanding the RNA ligand-ome.",10.1073/pnas.2422346122,biorxiv

To address this gap, we analyzed the effect of {Delta}-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on primary CD4 T cells that were latently infected with HIV. We found that THC had no detectable effect on baseline or latency reversing agent (LRA) stimulated HIV expression, or on expression of an activation marker (CD38). However, using an integrated multiomic single-cell analysis of genome-wide chromatin accessibility and gene expression, we observed altered expression of several hundred genes in HIV infected CD4 T cells after THC exposure, including transcriptional downregulation of genes involved in protein translation and antiviral pathways, indicating that THC suppresses innate immune activation in infected cells. Additionally, chromatin accessibility analysis demonstrated upregulated chromatin binding activity for the transcriptional regulator CTCF, and reduced activity for members of the ETS transcription factor family in infected cells after THC exposure. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which cannabis use could influence the persistence of HIV within cellular reservoirs and the molecular phenotype of latently infected cells. Further elucidation of the underlying mechanisms involved in THC-mediated changes to HIV infected cells, will lead to an improved understanding of the impact of cannabis use on the HIV reservoir.

ImportanceCannabis use is common among individuals living with HIV, but the long-term effects of cannabis use on the HIV reservoir are not yet studied completely. We employed advanced single-cell technologies to reveal how cannabis components, specifically THC, influence HIV-infected immune cells and their pattern of gene expression. We found that, while THC doesnt reactivate virus in latently infected cells, it alters the molecular characteristics of these infected immune cells. These findings are important because they underscore how cannabis could regulate persistent infection in people living with HIV. Understanding these cellular changes in response to THC could be helpful for successful treatment for people living with HIV.",NA,biorxiv

Here we designed and validated a synthetic chloroplast autophagy receptor using biochemical, genetical, and imaging approaches. This synthetic receptor, LIR-SNT-BFP, was constructed by fusing a fragment containing the LC3-interacting region (LIR) of the selective autophagy receptor NBR1 and the N-terminal amphipathic -helix of the chloroplast outer envelope protein SFR2. The fusion protein LIR-SNT-BFP coated the chloroplast and attracted ATG8a in planta. Upon induction, the synthetic receptor elicited vacuole-mediated microautophagy of entire chloroplasts independent of the ATG8 conjugation machinery proteins ATG5 or ATG7. Meanwhile, it induced chloroplast division; however the induced chlorophagy was independent of PDV2. Notably, moderate chlorophagy improves rosette growth, but excessive levels are detrimental.

Whether it contributes to sleep variability in humans is not yet established. Here, we investigated if the in vivo activity of the LC is related to the variability in the quality of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep.

MethodsWe assessed the LC activity of 34 healthy younger ([~]22y) and 18 older ([~]61y) individuals engaged in bottom-up and top-down cognitive tasks using 7-Tesla functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We further recorded their sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate associations between LC fMRI measures and REM sleep EEG metrics.

ResultsTheta oscillation energy during REM sleep was positively associated with LC response in the top-down task. In contrast, REM sleep theta energy was negatively associated with LC activity in older individuals during the bottom-up task. Importantly, sigma oscillations power immediately preceding a REM sleep episode was positively associated with LC activity in the top-down task.

ConclusionsLC activity during wakefulness was related to REM sleep intensity and to a transient EEG change preceding REM sleep, a feature causally related to LC activity in animal studies. The associations depend on the cognitive task, suggesting that a balanced level of LC tonic activity during wakefulness is required for optimal expression of REM sleep. The findings may have implications for the high prevalence of sleep complaints reported in aging and for disorders such as insomnia, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons disease, for which the LC may play pivotal roles through sleep.",10.1186/s12929-025-01127-9,biorxiv

Protein glycosylation is a frequent post-translational modification; however, most EV studies focus only on proteomics, while mapping glycosylation changes of proteins are still underrepresented. To address this shortcoming, we analyzed the proteomic, N-glycoproteomic, and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) profiles of small EVs (sEVs) derived from A549 lung adenocarcinoma and BEAS-2B non-tumorigenic epithelial cell lines. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering revealed that all three profiles are highly dependent on the origin of sEV, highlighting fundamental differences not only at the proteomic but also at the N-glycopeptide and CS/DS levels. Protein expression differences were primarily associated with the upregulation of cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, metabolism, and protein synthesis, while immune-related processes were predominantly downregulated. Proteomics revealed differential expressions of 5 CS proteoglycans, anticipating that their CS profile may also change. N-glycoproteomics highlighted a shift from complex to hybrid N-glycans in cancer sEVs, alongside a significant decrease in fucosylation. Prominent glycoproteins characterized with multiple glycosylation sites included versican, galectin-3-binding protein and laminins. The total amount of CS/DS increased 3.4-fold in cancer sEVs, while the ratio of the two monosulfated disaccharides changed 2-fold, suggesting altered sulfation mechanisms. These findings highlight the potential of N-glycoproteomics and GAG profiling to enhance biomarker discovery and EV-based cancer diagnostics.

The emergence of novel protein function can be facilitated by gene duplication (neofunctionalisation); rapid morphological change is often accompanied with speciation (punctuated equilibrium); and the establishment of cultural identity is frequently driven by sociopolitical division (schismogenesis). In each case, the change resists rehomogenisation; promoting assortment into distinct lineages that are susceptible to different selective pressures, leading to rapid divergence. The traditional gradualistic view of evolution struggles to detect this phenomenon. We have devised a probabilistic framework that constructs phylogenies, tests hypotheses, and improves divergence time estimation when evolutionary bursts are present. As well as assigning a clock rate of gradual evolution to each branch of a tree, this model also assigns a spike of abrupt change, and independently estimates the contributions arising from each process. We provide evidence of abrupt evolution at the time of branching for proteins (aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases), animal morphologies (cephalopods), and human languages (Indo-European). These three cases provide unique insights: for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the trees are substantially different from those obtained under gradualist models; Cephalopod morphologies are found to evolve almost exclusively through abrupt shifts; and Indo-European dispersal is estimated to have started around 6000 BCE, corroborating the recently proposed hybrid explanation. This work demonstrates a robust means for detecting burstlike processes, and advances our understanding of the link between evolutionary change and branching events.

Inhibitory synapses are key regulators of the functional balance of neural circuits. However, due to the diversity of inhibitory presynaptic neurons, the complex composition of postsynaptic receptor subunits and the lack of typical postsynaptic dense structure, there are relatively few studies on the regulatory mechanisms for inhibitory synaptic structure and function, and insufficient understanding of the cellular and molecular abnormalities of inhibitory synapses in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we report a crucial role for endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses. We show that endophilin A1 directly interacts with the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin in excitatory neurons, and promotes organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic density and synaptic recruitment/stabilization of the {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type A receptors via its plasma membrane association and actin polymerization promoting activities. Loss of endophilin A1 by gene knockout in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells weakens inhibitory synaptic transmission and causes imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory function of neural circuits, leading to increased susceptibility to epilepsy. Our findings identify endophilin A1 as an iPSD component and provide new insights into the organization and stabilization of inhibitory postsynapses to maintain E/I balance as well as the pathogenesis of epilepsy.",NA,biorxiv

Recent research into these factors has predominantly attempted to unveil the ecological processes and structural constraints that influence network stability. Comparatively little attention has been given to the consequences of evolutionary events, despite the fact that the interplay between ecology and evolution has been recognised as fundamental to understand the formation of ecological communities and predict their reaction to change. In light of current environmental challenges, there is a compelling need for a quantitative framework to predict biodiversity loss under environmental perturbations while accounting for evolutionary processes.

We extend existing mutualistic population dynamical models by incorporating evolutionary adaptation events to address this critical gap. We relate ecological aspects of mutualistic community stability to the stability of persistent evolutionary pathways. Our findings highlight the significance of the structural stability of ecological systems in predicting biodiversity loss under both evolutionary and environmental changes, particularly in relation to species-level selection. Notably, our simulations reveal that the evolution of mutualistic networks tends to increase a network-dependent parameter termed critical competition, which places systems in a regime in which mutualistic interactions enhance structural stability and, consequently, biodiversity.

This research emphasizes the pivotal role of natural selection in shaping ecological networks, steering them towards reduced effective competition below a critical threshold where mutualistic interactions foster stability. The outcomes of our study contribute to the development of a predictive framework for eco-evolutionary dynamics, offering insights into the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes in the face of environmental change.",NA,biorxiv

It is generally imagined as unique population of cells producing one or a few signaling molecules, responsible for neural induction and for patterning the neural plate and the mesoderm. Here we use single cell and tissue transcriptomics to explore the expression of signaling molecules in the node (the amniote organizer). Although all organizer cells express the homeobox gene Goosecoid, node cells show a diversity of transcription factor signatures associated with expression of subsets of many signaling molecules, suggesting distinct cell sub-populations. Using a recently described Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) of 175 transcriptional responses to neural induction, we explore the activities of 22 of these signals and find that some of them regulate the expression of components of the GRN that are not responsive to previously described pathways associated with neural induction. These results suggest that rather than a single, static, homogeneous population, the organizer comprises a diverse collective of specialized cells that emit cooperating signals to instruct receiving neighbors to adopt their new identities.

Significance StatementThe Spemann-Mangold organizer is an embryonic region that can induce the formation of a fully patterned nervous system from non-neural embryonic cells.

Separately, the anisotropic nature of white matter axons and white matter vasculature have been shown to cause an orientation dependence on various MRI contrasts used to study the structure and function of the brain; however, little is known of the relationship between axonal and vascular orientations. Thus, the aim of this study is to compare the orientation between nerve fibers and vasculature within the white matter. To do this, we use diffusion MRI and susceptibility weighted imaging acquired in the same healthy young adult volunteers and analyze the alignment between white matter fibers and blood vessels in different brain regions, and along different pathways, to determine the degree of alignment between these structures. We first describe vascular orientation throughout the brain and note several regions with consistent orientations across individuals. Next, we find that vasculature does not necessarily align with the dominant direction of white matter in many regions, but, due to the presence of crossing fiber populations, does align with at least some white matter within each MRI voxel. Even though the spatial patterns of blood vessels run in parallel to several white matter tracts, they do not do so along the entire pathway, nor for all pathways, suggesting that vasculature does not supply/drain blood in a tract-specific manner.

Overall, these findings suggest that the vascular architecture within the white matter is closely related to, but not the same as, the organization of neural pathways.

Immune priming provides protection against previously encountered pathogens. However, causes and mechanisms of immune priming are still not well understood in most organisms. In this work, we combine RNA sequencing with transmission electron microscopy to investigate the dynamic processes during priming in the gut of a well-established model for oral immune priming, consisting of the host Tribolium castaneum and its entomopathogen Bacillus thuringiensis tenebrionis (Btt). We show that priming with specific, pathogen-derived virulence-relevant factors causes damage in the gut of T. castaneum larvae, which leads to an early physiological stress response as well as the upregulation of a specific set of immune genes. This response diminishes over time yet enables the gut to upregulate genes known to interfere with Btt virulence when T. castaneum larvae are later exposed to infectious Btt spores. The identification of these processes increases our understanding of immune priming as a dynamic process where cellular responses in concert with specific gene regulation prepare the gut tissue and thereby enable more efficient protection against infection. Such work can further help us understand the origin and mechanism of innate immune memory.

Author summaryInvertebrate animals do not possess a classical adaptive immune system. And yet, many of these animals show forms of immune memory, collectively called immune priming. In this work, we investigate the causes of oral immune priming in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum in response to its bacterial entomopathogen Bacillus thuringiensis tenebrionis. Primary exposure to Btt spent culture media supernatants enables the larvae of T. castaneum to better withstand a subsequent infection with infectious Btt spores. We show that exposing T. castaneum larvae to those supernatants leads to damage in the gut resulting in a strong stress and immune response early after priming and a targeted up-regulation of beneficial genes upon the secondary re-encounter with Btt. These results suggest fundamental stress responses can be involved in innate immune memory phenomena, which has implications in translational research across species.",NA,biorxiv

Essential tremor (ET) is a progressive neurological disease associated with cognitive impairment and, in some cases, tau accumulation. Consequently, we explored the tau assembly conformation in ET patients with tau pathology using cytometry-based tau biosensor assays. These assays quantify tau prion seeding activity present in brain homogenates based on conversion of intracellular tau-fluorescent protein fusions from a soluble to an aggregated state. Prions exhibit seeding barriers, whereby a specific assembly structure cannot serve as a template for a native monomer if the amino acids are not compatible. We recently exploited the tau prion species barrier to define tauopathies by systematically substituting alanine (Ala) in the tau monomer and measuring its incorporation into seeded aggregates within biosensor cells. The Ala scan precisely classified the conformation of tau seeds from diverse tauopathies. We next studied 18 ET patient brains with tau pathology. Only one case had concurrent high amyloid-{beta} plaque pathology consistent with Alzheimers disease (AD). We detected robust tau seeding activity in 9 (50%) of the patients. This predominantly localized to the temporal pole and temporal cortex. We examined 8 ET cases with the Ala scan and determined that the amino acid requirements for tau monomer incorporation into aggregates seeded from these ET brain homogenates were identical to those of AD and primary age-related tauopathy (PART), and completely distinct from other tauopathies such as corticobasal degeneration, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Based on these studies, tau assembly cores in a pathologically confined subset of ET cases with high tau pathology are identical to AD and PART. This could facilitate more precise diagnosis and therapy for ET patients with cognitive impairment.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we describe Jyvaskylavirus, the first giant virus isolated from Finland. This clade B marseillevirus was found in Acanthamoeba castellanii from a composting soil sample in Jyvaskyla, Central Finland. Its genome shares similarities with other marseilleviruses, including conserved Nucleocytoviricota genes, histone-like genes, and three unique ORFans. Helium ion microscopy and electron microscopy of infected cells unraveled stages of the Jyvaskylavirus lifecycle, such as single virions attached to the cell membrane, likely triggering endocytosis, and virus-rich vesicle formation within the cytoplasm. We also reconstructed the Jyvaskylavirus particle to 6.3 [A] resolution using cryo-EM. The [~]2,500 [A] diameter virion displays structural similarities to other Marseilleviridae giant viruses. The capsid comprises of 9,240 copies of the major capsid protein ORF184, which possesses a double jellyroll fold arranged in trimers forming pseudo-hexameric capsomers. Below the capsid shell, the internal membrane vesicle encloses the genome. Through cross-structural and -sequence comparisons with other Marseilleviridae using AI-based software in model building and prediction, we elucidated ORF142 as the penton protein, which plugs the twelve vertices of the capsid. Five additional ORFs were identified, with models predicted and fitted into densities that either cap the capsomers externally or stabilize them internally.

The isolation of Jyvaskylavirus, along with other virus-like particles, not only suggests that these viruses may be widespread in the boreal environment but also provide insights extendable to other marseilleviruses, addressing the previously lacking structural data on minor capsid proteins.",NA,biorxiv

Metabolizable energy (ME) was calculated to estimate energy content per kilogram of feed. The crude protein content of housefly maggots (57.8%) was comparable to that of fish meal (58.5%), which was the highest among the evaluated feeds, while mealworms had a slightly lower protein content (51.02%).

When vision is impaired, individuals adjust their walking patterns to maintain stability. This study developed a simplified sagittal model to examine how visual deprivation affects treadmill walking at a controlled speed while ensuring dynamic stability. The model provides a framework for exploring outcomes that are challenging to assess experimentally. We hypothesized that the model would align with experimental data on step frequency, step length, and stability while predicting the steps that could lead to falls without vision. This study presents a bipedal model with two degrees of freedom, controlled by a hierarchical system. Two bio-inspired constraints were implemented: a speed constraint to match with treadmill pace, and a stability constraint to maintain walking stability. The weight of the feedback signal related to joint angles was modified to simulate vision loss. Visual deprivation increased step frequency and decreased step length to prevent falls. Additionally, prolonged deprivation led to step length fluctuations and increased constraint errors, ultimately causing falls. These findings align with human data, validating the potential of the model for rehabilitation research in individuals with visual impairments.",NA,biorxiv

However, variants of concern (VOC), often containing multiple mutations within neutralizing epitopes, confer immune evasion of the response generated by current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. To assess the immunogenicity and virus-neutralisation ability of antibodies induced by individual or combination of Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca: AZ) and Comirnaty (Pfizer: PZ) vaccines and of a hybrid immunity induced in people who were also infected with SARS-CoV-2, longitudinal sera samples of participants recruited through the David Serisier Research biobank (Mater Research Hospital) or at the University of Queensland were collected.

In particular, from the local structure of two diverging sister-forks to the higher-level organization of the replication machinery into nuclear domains, the mechanistic details of chromatin duplication in the 3D nuclear space remain debated. In this study, we use a computational model of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome to explore how replication influences chromatin folding. By integrating both a realistic description of the genome 3D architecture and 1D replication timing, simulations reveal that the colocalization of sister-forks produce a characteristic ""fountain"" pattern around early origins of replication. We confirm the presence of similar features in vivo in early S-phase with new Hi-C data in various conditions, showing that it is replication-dependent and cohesin-independent. At a larger scale, we show that the 3D genome leads to forks being highly enriched at one pole of the nucleus in early S-phase, before later redistributing more homogeneously, and may favor the higher-order clustering of forks into Replication Foci, as observed in earlier microscopy experiments. Additionally, replication causes temporary chromatin slowdown and reduced mobility due to fork passage and sister chromatid intertwining. Overall, our model offers new insights into the spatial and dynamic organization of chromatin during replication in eukaryotes.",NA,biorxiv

Fusion transcripts are well-studied in cancer, but their expression and inter-individual variability in normal human tissues has not been thoroughly investigated. We conducted a genome-wide fusion transcript analysis in postmortem human brain tissues from 276 individuals, identifying 717 distinct fusion transcripts.

We found that regions with high species diversity are concentrated in temperate forests, which suggests that areas with mild seasonal variation may serve as diversity hotspots. Species range estimates revealed extensive variability, both within and across taxonomic sections; while some species are cosmopolitan, others have more restricted ranges. Furthermore, range overlap between species is generally low. The top predictors of mean species richness were the index of cumulative human impact and five bioclimatic factors, such as temperature and temperate vs non-temperate ecoregions. Our future climate analyses revealed considerable variation in species range estimates in response to changing climates; some species ranges are predicted to expand (e.g., the food spoilage and mycotoxin-producing Aspergillus versicolor), and others are predicted to contract or remain stable. Notably, the predicted range of the major pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus was predicted to decrease in response to climate change, whereas the range of the major pathogen Aspergillus flavus was predicted to increase and gradually decrease. Our findings reveal how both natural and human factors influence Aspergillus species ranges and highlight their ecological diversity, including the diversity of their responses to changing climates, which is of relevance to pathogen and mycotoxin risk assessment.",NA,biorxiv

To understand if the ATPase function is required in DC, we first demonstrated that DPY-27 is capable of hydrolyzing ATP in vitro. Then, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to generate an ATPase mutation in dpy-27 and demonstrated that this mutation results in a loss of DC. Specifically, we found that without ATPase function, DPY-27 containing condensin IDC has reduced capacity to bind DNA, condense the X chromosomes, and facilitate H4K20me1 enrichment on the X-chromosomes.

SlimVar uses rapid photobleaching to resolve tracked particles to molecular steps in intensity. By modifying widefield microscopy to minimise optical aberrations and robustly post-process few-photon signals, SlimVar mitigates performance losses at depth.

MethodsWe used an extended pan-cancer transcriptome assembly to identify potential effects of RTEs on the genes near or within which they have integrated. These were subsequently verified in test cases by further analysis of transcriptional profiles in cancer patient data, and by in vitro studies involving restoration of gene activity, and proliferation and migration assays in cancer cell lines.

ResultsWe report that cancer-specific transcriptional activation of RTEs causes frequent reduction or loss of gene function. Exonisation and alternative splicing of RTEs creates non-functional RNA and protein isoforms and derepressed RTE promoter activity initiates antisense transcription, both at the expense of the canonical isoforms. Contrary to theoretical expectation, transcriptionally activated RTEs affect genes with established tumour-promoting function, including the common essential RNGTT and the lung cancer-promoting CHRNA5 genes. Furthermore, the disruptive effect of RTE activation on adjacent tumour-promoting genes is associated with slower disease progression in clinical data, whereas experimental restoration of gene activity enhances tumour cell in vitro growth and invasiveness

ConclusionsThese findings underscore the gene-disruptive potential of seemingly innocuous germline RTE integrations, unleashed only by their transcriptional utilisation in cancer. They further suggest that such metastable RTE integrations are co-opted as sensors of the epigenetic and transcriptional changes occurring during cellular transformation and as executors that disrupt the function of tumour-promoting genes.",10.1186/s13073-025-01479-9,biorxiv

As primary decomposers of mammalian feces, dung beetles are critical in ecosystem functioning, and their community structure is closely linked to their services. However, the introduction of invasive mammals threatens these beetles and potentially disrupts their ecosystem services. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the resulting changes in communities. We developed a novel population dynamics model focusing on the interactions among mammals, feces, and dung beetles. Our results indicate that such invasions increase the risk of extinction of specialist dung beetles that cannot utilize the feces of invasive mammals. The risk of extinction is particularly high when generalist dung beetles show a preference for native feces, leading to intensified interspecific competition for resources. Additionally, the extinction risk of specialist dung beetles increases when invasive mammals display irruptive population dynamics. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that non-native mammalian invasions disrupt the coexistence of native dung beetle communities, potentially leading to losses in biodiversity and ecosystem function. These risks should be considered in future empirical studies to evaluate the impact of invasive mammals on dung beetle communities.",NA,biorxiv

Through analyses of cranial suture formation and maintenance in a fgfr3 LoF zebrafish model displaying abnormal suture morphology, we demonstrate for the first time that Fgfr3 plays a pleiotropic role during these events. Transmission electron microscopy and second harmonic generation imaging revealed that Fgfr3 is involved in the proper organization of the collagen network within the suture. By employing specific transgenic reporter lines and studying gene expression of suture mesenchymal stem cell markers via RNAscope in situ hybridization, we show that Fgfr3 is crucial for regulating osteogenesis within the suture.

Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have enabled the generation of longer sequences at a much lower price. Thus, long-read sequencing technologies have become increasingly popular in sequencing-based studies. However, classical sequence analysis algorithms face significant scalability challenges when aligning long sequences. As a result, several heuristic methods have been developed to improve performance at the expense of accuracy, as they often fail to produce the optimal alignment.

ResultsThis paper introduces QuickEd, a sequence alignment algorithm based on a bound-and-align strategy. First, QuickEd effectively bounds the maximum alignment-score using efficient heuristic strategies. Then, QuickEd utilizes this bound to reduce the computations required to produce the optimal alignment. Using QuickEds bound-and-align strategy, we reduce O(n2) complexity of traditional dynamic programming algorithms to O(n[s]), where n is the sequence length and[s] is an estimated upper bound of the alignment-score between the sequences. As a result, QuickEd is consistently faster than other state-of-the-art implementations, such as Edlib and BiWFA, achieving performance speedups of 1.6-7.3x and 2.1 - 2.5x, respectively, aligning long and noisy datasets. In addition, QuickEd maintains a stable memory footprint below 50 MB while aligning sequences up to 1 Mbp.

While temporal aspects of maternal mRNA decay are known, spatial mechanisms remain underexplored. Using CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas13d systems, we functionally dissected the contribution of maternal versus zygotic fractions and overcame challenges of studying embryonic lethal genes. We identified differentially distributed maternal mRNAs in specific cells and evidenced the critical role of five maternal mRNAs, cth1, arl4d, abi1b, foxa and lhx1a, in embryogenesis. Further, we focused on the functionally uncharacterized cth1 gene, revealing its essential role in gametogenesis and embryogenesis. Cth1 acts as a spatio-temporal RNA decay factor regulating mRNA stability and accumulation of its targets in a spatio-temporal manner through 3UTR recognition during early development. Furthermore, Cth1 3UTR drives its spatio-temporal RNA localization. Our findings provide new insights into spatio-temporal RNA decay mechanisms and highlight dual CRISPR-Cas strategies in studying embryonic development.

They also fail to account for the underlying biological mechanisms carried out by biomolecular interactions and dynamics i.e., proteins often interact with other proteins, molecules, and pathways in complex biological systems. In this work, we propose LC-PLM based on an alternative protein LM architecture, BiMamba-S, built off selective structured state-space models, to learn high-quality universal protein representations at the amino acid token level using masked language modeling. We also introduce its graph-contextual variant, LC-PLM-G, which contextualizes protein-protein interaction (PPI) graphs for a second stage of training. LC-PLM demonstrates favorable neural scaling laws, better length extrapolation capability, and a 7% to 34% improvement on protein downstream tasks than Transformer-based ESM-2. LC-PLM-G further trained within the context of PPI graphs shows promising results on protein structure and function prediction tasks.

However, the drivers underlying feeding on preferred (e.g., Acropora spp.) versus non-preferred (e.g., Porites spp.) are poorly understood. We hypothesised that coral venom may influence CoTS food preferences. We investigated whether coral venom toxin and peptide families may drive CoTS prey preferences by comparing the genomes and transcriptomes of preferred (five Acropora species) and non-preferred (five Porites species and Echinopora lamellosa) prey species of CoTS. We constructed databases of known cnidarian venom toxins, and along with the full UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Tox-Prot database, used these to identify toxin peptides and investigate function and phylogeny. The most abundant toxins across all coral species included kunitz-type neurotoxins, neurotoxic turripeptides, snake venom lectins, toxic proteases and actinoporins. There were proteins present only in certain Porites species but completely absent from all Acropora species (e.g., tereporin/conoporin, snake venom peptides) and vice versa (e.g., sarafotoxin). Further, Porites species contained a homolog to conkunitzin, a toxin known to disintegrate the tube feet of CoTS, suggesting a potential mechanism for their lower susceptibility to predation. We also observed a greater diversity of jellyfish-like proteins in CoTS-exposed Porites species compared to naive Porites species, suggesting these proteins deter CoTS.

Studying CNVs in genomes from single or few cells is significantly advancing our knowledge in human disorders and disease susceptibility. Low-input including low-cell and single-cell sequencing data for haploid and diploid organisms generally displays shallow and highly non-uniform read counts resulting from the whole genome amplification steps that introduce amplification biases. In addition, haploid organisms typically possess relatively short genomes and require a higher degree of DNA amplification compared to diploid organisms. However, most CNV detection methods are specifically developed for diploid genomes without specific consideration of effects on haploid genomes. Challenges also reside in reference samples or normal controls which are used to provide baseline signals for defining copy number losses or gains. In traditional methods, references are usually pre-specified from cells that are assumed to be normal or disease-free. However, the use of pre-defined reference cells can bias results if common CNVs are present. Here, we present the development of a comprehensive statistical framework for data normalization and CNV detection in haploid single- or low-cell DNA sequencing data called HapCNV. The prominent advancement is the construction of a novel genomic location specific pseudo-reference that selects unbiased references using a preliminary cell clustering method. This approach effectively preserves common CNVs. Using simulations, we demonstrated that HapCNV outperformed existing methods by generating more accurate CNV detection, especially for short CNVs. Superior performance of HapCNV was also validated in detecting known CNVs in a real P. falciparum parasite dataset. In conclusion, HapCNV provides a novel and useful approach for CNV detection in haploid low-input sequencing datasets, with easy applicability to diploids.",NA,biorxiv

Here, by combining gene functional analyses, pharmacological analyses, and live imaging, we propose that the gap represents the time required for sufficient cAMP accumulation to trigger metamorphosis. Not only the Gs pathway but also the Gi and Gq pathways are involved in the initiation of metamorphosis in the downstream signaling cascade of the neurotransmitter GABA, the known initiator of Ciona metamorphosis.

Using a common-garden field test gathering 20-year-old progeny trees resulting from rigorous controlled crosses including previously verified genetic identity of the parents, growth patterns and wood density differences could be observed between species and between them and their F1 hybrids. A dendroecological analytical approach relying on wood cores was used and revealed similar wood responses to climatic variations between species, both through lifetime climate sensitivity and through episodic stress response indexes. They were however differentially expressed in early- and latewood between black spruce and red spruce, differences likely driven by diverging cambial phenology adaptations to different growing season lengths. F1 hybrids exhibited hybrid vigor for cumulative growth under the test site conditions, but showed intermediate values for traits related to climate response. These results offer new perspectives for understanding the dynamics of adaptation in hybrid zones in the context of climate change, as well as for guiding conservation and genetic improvement efforts.

Treating this disease is particularly difficult since the articular cartilage lacks intrinsic repair capacity even though mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present in the joint environment and have robust chondrogenic potential. We have previously shown that there is heterogeneity of MSC sub-types within the human synovium, yet it remains unclear if any of these MSC types can regenerate cartilage and/or impact OA disease progression. Therefore, we have undertaken this study focusing on clonally derived MSC populations derived from the synovium of normal and OA patients to characterize if any MSC populations can positively impact OA disease trajectory in a rat model of OA.

MSCs were clonally isolated by indexed flow cytometry, expanded in culture and then characterized for differentiation capacity and by quantitative proteomics. MSC clones were then transplanted into a xenograft rat OA model and treatment effect was determined by histology and immunofluorescence outcomes. We identified heterogeneity in putative MSCs derived from within and between patient groups (normal vs. OA) and the ability of these cells to effect repair in a rat OA model. However, these different sub-types of MSCs could not be distinguished by traditional cell surface markers showing the need for a better understanding of these populations at the single cell level. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, CD47 was identified a novel marker of human MSCs. Using the same rat model of OA, CD47Hi expressing cells were found to have robust treatment efficacy and directly contributed to the formation of new articular cartilage tissue. Characterizing MSCs is essential to understand which sub-types are appropriate for further clinical investigation.

Xa48 is retained in indica but functionally lost in japonica rice. OsVOZ1 has also diverged into two haplotypes, indica kept both OsVOZ1A/S alleles that match XA48; while japonica only inherited OsVOZ1A that greatly decreases yield when Xa48 is reintroduced into japonica, mechanistically explaining the Xa48 loss in japonica. We resurrected wild rice broad-spectrum resistance by stacking XA48-mediated ETI with XA21-mediated pattern-triggered immunity (PTI).

But forward models can also be updated by sensory prediction errors, as in sensorimotor adaptation. Disentangling the neuronal correlates of processes related to sensorimotor incongruence detection from those related to adaptation can be challenging. Here, we approached this challenge with a novel, virtual reality based hand-target tracking task that allowed us to manipulate the behavioral relevance of delayed visual movement feedback, while recording hemodynamic brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants performed continuous right hand grasping movements to track a target oscillation with either their real, unseen hand or with a glove-controlled virtual hand. The movements of the virtual hand were delayed in a roving oddball fashion. Therefore, tracking with the virtual hand (VH task) required visuomotor adaptation, whereas tracking with the real hand (RH task) required ignoring visuomotor delays. VH > RH task execution produced stronger activity in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the bilateral extrastriate visual cortex. Delays correlated with activity in several regions, prominently including right temporoparietal regions, in both tasks. Crucially, the cerebellum showed a stronger delay dependent activation, and increased functional connectivity with the PPC, in the VH > RH task. Delay changes and errors correlated with activity in the anterior insulae (AI), and more strongly so in the VH>RH task. Thus, the instructed behavioral relevance of delayed visual movement feedback enhanced responses of the cerebellum and PPC, and their communication, likely for visuomotor adaptation. In contrast, temporoparietal regions compared predicted and actual visual movement feedback irrespective of its behavioral relevance, while the AI signaled visual mismatches particularly when these were behaviorally relevant.",NA,biorxiv

In this way we identify predicted cellular states, predictable off-target cell types based on embryology and transitional mesodermal populations with no clear in vivo equivalent.

These properties also make measurement of speech movements challenging, often requiring extensive physical sensors placed around the mouth and face that are not easily tolerated by certain populations such as young children. Recent progress in machine learning-based markerless facial landmark tracking technology demonstrated its potential to provide lip tracking without the need for physical sensors, but whether such technology can provide submillimeter precision and accuracy in 3D remains unknown. Moreover, it is also unclear whether such technology can be applied to track speech movements in young children. Here, we developed a novel approach that integrates Shape Preserving Facial Landmarks with Graph Attention Networks (SPIGA), a facial landmark detector, and CoTracker, a transformer-based neural network model that jointly tracks dense points across a video sequence. We further examined and validated this novel approach by assessing its tracking precision and accuracy. The findings revealed that our approach that integrates SPIGA and CoTracker was more precise ({approx} 0.15 mm in standard deviation) than SPIGA alone ({approx} 0.35 mm). In addition, its 3D tracking performance was comparable to electromagnetic articulography ({approx} 0.29 mm RMSE against simultaneously recorded articulograph data). Importantly, the approach performed similarly well across adults and young children (i.e., 3- and 4-year-olds). Because our framework is built upon open-source pretrained models that are fully trained, it promotes accessibility and open science while saving computing resources. Furthermore, given that this framework combines a landmark detection model (SPIGA) with a tracker model (CoTracker) to improve precision/accuracy, our novel approach serves as a proof-of-concept for enhancing the performance of a wide variety of commonly used markerless tracking applications in biology and neuroscience.

Our combined CoTracker-based approach demonstrated submillimeter precision and accuracy desired for speech kinematic recording. In addition, our approach does not involve training and validation for each population (e.g., young children vs. adults), saving time and computing resources.

We systematically analyzed the developmental role of an expanded TTR family of proteins, structurally analogous to mammalian thyroid hormone-transporting Transthyretin, and identified three paralogous proteins, TTR-15, TTR-16, and TTR-17, differentially expressed in somatic cells of the gonads and secreted around gametes in C. elegans. Simultaneous inactivation of TTR-15, TTR-16, and TTR-17 leads to a rapid reduction in reproductive capacity in middle age. While oocyte and sperm production remain unaffected in the triple mutants, late-onset infertility results from stalled ovulation. Mechanistically, the absence of TTR-15, TTR-16, and TTR-17 causes sperm to prematurely deplete the cytoplasmic pool of major sperm protein (MSP), released via non-conventional vesicle budding as a signal for ovulation.

Genes encoding for epigenetic regulators are among the most frequent targets for mutations and structural variations in AML, giving rise to profound epigenetic heterogeneity between and within tumors. Deletions of chromosome 5q [del(5q)] are among the most common copy number alterations in AML and are associated with extremely poor clinical outcome and therapy resistance, however the mechanisms linking del(5q) to leukemic progression are not understood. Analyzing DNA methylation profiles from 477 elderly AML patients using DNA methylome deconvolution, we discovered that del(5q) AML is an epigenetically distinct subgroup characterized by a signature of DNA hypermethylation, which we propose may be linked to dysregulation of H3K9me1/2 and overexpression of the leukemic stem cell marker, DNMT3B. Interrogation of the minimally deleted 5q region highlighted the H3K9me1/2 demethylase KDM3B as a likely target for haploinsufficiency in this subgroup. Our data suggest that del(5q) AML should be reconsidered as an epigenetically dysregulated subgroup, driven by heterozygous loss of KDM3B, and that the resulting imbalance of H3K9me1/2 may contribute to the progression of these aggressive leukemias.",NA,biorxiv

The granulomas necrotic core, where bacteria reside extracellularly in humans, is difficult to assess in many experimentally tractable models. Here, using necrotic mycobacterial granulomas in adult zebrafish, we develop dual RNA-seq across different host genotypes to identify the transcriptional alterations that enable bacteria to survive within this key microenvironment. Through pharmacological and genetic interventions, we find that neutrophils within mature, necrotic granulomas promote bacterial growth, in part through upregulation of the bacterial devR regulon. We identify conserved suites of bacterial transcriptional programs induced only in the context of this unique necrotic extracellular niche, including bacterial modules related to K+ transport and rpf genes. Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains across diverse lineages and human populations suggests that granuloma-specific transcriptional modules are targets for bacterial genetic adaptation in the context of human infection.

Next, we present an Astral spectral library for 10,109 protein groups expressed in human plasma. Using Astral with a throughput of 60 sample-per-day, OmniProt identifies ca 3000 to 6000 protein groups from human plasma.

Through controlled contamination experiments, we identified and validated protein biomarkers for contaminations of platelet, erythrocyte, and coagulation, respectively, in NP-based plasma proteomics experiments. We further developed an open-access software Baize for accessing plasma proteomics contamination. Finally, we validated our OmniProt workflow and Baize software in a clinical cohort of 193 patients with CT-indistinct benign nodules or early lung cancers.

However, most GlyT2 inhibitors have not progressed to clinical use because of significant side effects, partly from irreversible inhibition at analgesic doses. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of human GlyT2 bound to the potent pseudo-irreversible inhibitor ORG25543, a reversible analogue RPI-GLYT2-82, and in substrate-free state. Both inhibitors bind an extracellular allosteric site, locking the transporter in an outward-open conformation, whereas the substrate-free GlyT2 adopts an inward-open conformation. We demonstrate that RPI-GLYT2-82 has a faster off-rate, providing analgesia in mouse neuropathic pain models, with no observed mechanism-based side-effects or addiction liability.

Here we present a multiscale analysis into the structure of kDNA using a combination of high-resolution atomic force microscopy and custom-designed image analysis protocols. By capturing a notably large set of high-resolution images, we are able to look beyond individual kDNA variations and quantify population properties throughout several length scales. Within the sample, geometric fluctuations of area and mean curvature are observed, corresponding with previous in-vitro measurements. These translate to localised variations in density, with a sample-wide decrease in DNA density from the outer rim of the molecule to the centre and an increase in pore size. Nodes were investigated in a single molecule study, and their estimated connectivity significantly exceeded mean valence, with a high dependence on their position in the network. While node separation was approximately half the minicircle circumference, it followed a strong bimodal distribution, suggesting more complex underlying behaviour. Finally, upon selective digestion of the network, breakdown of the fibril-cap heterogeneity was observed, with molecules expanding less upon immobilisation on the mica surface. Additionally, selective digestion was seen in localised areas of the network, increasing pore size disproportionately. Overall, the combination of high-resolution AFM and single molecule image analysis provides a promising method to the continued investigation of complex nanoscale structures.

To achieve this functional diversity, dynein must bind to the multi-subunit complex dynactin and one of a family of cargo adaptors to be converted into an active, processive motor complex. Very little is known about the dynamic processes that promote the formation of this complex. To delineate the kinetic steps that lead to dynein activation, we developed a single-molecule fluorescence assay to visualize the real-time formation of dynein-dynactin-adaptor complexes in vitro. We found that dynactin and adaptors bind dynein independently rather than cooperatively. We also found that different dynein adaptors promote dynein-dynactin-adaptor assembly with dramatically different kinetics, which results in complex formation occurring via different assembly pathways. Despite differences in association rates or mechanism of assembly, all adaptors tested can generate a population of tripartite complexes that are very stable. Our work provides a model for how modulating the kinetics of dynein-dynactin-adaptor binding can be harnessed to promote differential dynein activation and reveals a new facet of the functional diversity of the dynein motor.",NA,biorxiv

For example, courtship behavior involves sensorimotor processing of signals by prospective partners that can result in behavioral dialogue, such as stereotyped movements and singing. The courtship behavior of Drosophila melanogaster males with their partners, which are usually female but can also be male, involves singing. To investigate how behavioral feed-back and sensorimotor processing contribute to flexible social interactions, we compared the courtship behavior and singing of male D. melanogaster towards males and females. Quantitative analysis of their interactions revealed that while underlying courtship and song rules are unaffected by the sex of the partner, the behavioral dynamics and song sequences differ by partner sex. This divergence stems from sex-specific behavioral feedback: females decelerate to song, while males orient towards the singer. Moreover, optogenetic manipulations reveal that the partners responses are driven by a specific neural circuit that links song detection with arousal and social decisions. Our findings demonstrate that flexible social behaviors can arise from fixed sensorimotor rules through a context-dependent selection facilitated by the partners behavioral feedback. More broadly, our results reveal compositionality as a key mechanism for achieving behavioral flexibility during complex social interactions such as courtship.",NA,biorxiv

The connectome of cortical networks is high-dimensional, whereas neuronal activity is often low-dimensional relative to the number of neurons. Consequently, only a small fraction of the information contained in the connectome is relevant to activity. Can this relevant information be identified? In this study, we propose that the activity of each excitatory neuron in the sensory cortex can be approximated as a point in an embedding space defined by its connectome. Using the MICrONS dataset, which provides millimeter-scale, nanometer-resolution data on proofread and coregistered neurons, we perform a correlation analysis and identify a statistically significant alignment between morphological and functional similarities. Topological analysis reveals that the structured representation spaces of both neuronal activity and connectome share a low-dimensional, hyperbolic geometry with exponential scalability. Based on these findings, we develop a simple linear model to reconstruct in vivo neuronal activity by embedding anatomical affinities using multidimensional scaling (MDS). This approach achieves an explanation ratio of 68% compared to directly using activity similarity, outperforming the 56% obtained using the full connectome. Our results high-light a clear and robust structure-function coupling: although geometry-compatible dimensionality reduction methods discard much of the connectomes detailed information, they prove more effective in predicting neuronal activity, suggesting that synaptic connections may encode an abstract low-dimensional organization.",NA,biorxiv

The challenge to robustly express experimental transgenes in differentiated pluripotent stem cells is a major bottleneck in the field for applications such as CRISPR screening. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis to systematically evaluate the impact of various promoters, transcriptional regulatory elements, insulators, and genomic integration sites on transgene silencing during neuronal differentiation. Our findings reveal that specific combinations of promoters and transcriptional stability elements are able to prevent transgene silencing during differentiation, whereas chromatin insulators had less impact on silencing and three novel safe harbor integration sites performed similarly to the CLYBL locus.

This species is likely intolerant of subfreezing temperatures and recolonizes temperate environments yearly. We generated a new chromosome-level genome assembly for Z. indianus. Using resequencing of over 200 North American individuals collected over four years in temperate Virginia, plus a single collection from subtropical Florida, we tested for signatures of recolonization, population structure, and adaptation within invasive populations. We show founding populations are sometimes small and contain close genetic relatives, yet temporal population structure and differentiation of populations is mostly absent across recurrent recolonization events. Although we find limited signals of genome-wide spatial or temporal population structure, we identify haplotypes on the X chromosome that are repeatedly differentiated between Virginia and Florida populations. These haplotypes show signatures of natural selection and are not found in African populations. We also find evidence for several large structural polymorphisms segregating within North America populations and show X chromosome evolution in invasive populations is strikingly different from the autosomes. These results show that despite limited population structure, populations may rapidly evolve genetic differences early in an invasion. Further uncovering how these genomic regions influence invasive potential and success in new environments will advance our understanding of how organisms evolve in changing environments.

To do so, we generated one of the largest dendritic reconstruction datasets of cortical neurons to date, comprising 2,363 human neurons and 16,011 mouse neurons from the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, followed by establishing a rigorous procedure to identify anatomically and functionally corresponding brain regions with minimal variability in brain mapping. Additionally, we leveraged single nucleus/cell transcriptomic data from independent groups to validate the molecular correspondence of the brain regions identified in this study. The significance of these anatomically, functionally, and molecularly corresponding mouse-human region pairs is highlighted by examining the intrinsic features of their respective cortical regions. Our findings reveal that human neuron branching patterns differ dramatically from those in mouse brains, particularly in terms of dendritic branching frequency and normalized dendritic branching intervals. This difference is pronounced in the frontal and temporal lobes, underscoring the distinct neuronal architectures between the two species. At the single-neuron level, we found that neurons from the human frontal and parietal lobes are six times more separable than those from the same regions in mouse brains. This heightened separability is also observed between the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as between the parietal and temporal lobes in humans. We thoroughly explored the entire morphological feature space, along with its characteristic subspaces, and consistently found this distinct separability. Remarkably, this neuronal separability can be partially recapitulated when examining the global functional states of these brain lobes--using newly acquired Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals as physiological measures--as well as their global metabolic states, molecular profiles, and cortical geometry.

We confirmed fast turnover of STMN2 in U2OS cells and iPSC-derived neurons and showed that degradation occurs mainly by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The membrane targeting N-terminal domain of STMN2 promoted fast turnover, whereas its tubulin binding stathmin-like domain (SLD) promoted stabilization. Proximity labeling and imaging showed that STMN2 localizes to trans-Golgi network membranes and that tubulin binding reduces this localization. Pull-down assays showed that tubulin prefers to bind to soluble over membrane-bound STMN2. Our data suggest that STMN2 interconverts between a soluble form that is rapidly degraded unless bound to tubulin and a membrane-bound form that does not bind tubulin.

While ROS inhibit the E3 ligase CUL3KEAP1 to stabilize NRF2 and elicit antioxidant gene expression, cells recovering from stress must rapidly reactivate CUL3KEAP1 to prevent reductive stress and oxeiptosis-dependent cell death. How cells restore efficient NRF2-degradation upon ROS clearance remains poorly understood. Here, we identify TRIP12, an E3 ligase dysregulated in Clark-Baraitser Syndrome and Parkinsons Disease, as a component of the oxidative stress response. TRIP12 is a ubiquitin chain elongation factor that cooperates with CUL3KEAP1 to ensure robust NRF2 degradation. In this manner, TRIP12 accelerates stress response silencing as ROS are being cleared, but limits NRF2 activation during stress. The need for dynamic control of NRF2-degradation therefore comes at the cost of diminished stress signaling, suggesting that TRIP12 inhibition could be used to treat degenerative pathologies characterized by ROS accumulation.",NA,biorxiv

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been identified as a potential therapeutic approach for preserving CMECs and mitigating CMD.

ObjectiveThis systematic review aims to present the latest evidence on TCM intervention mechanisms in CMECs under diverse injury models.

MethodsThis systematic review was performed following the parameters of the PRISMA statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis). A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and China Biology Medicine disc. Reference lists of selected articles were reviewed to identify relevant studies. The search was not limited by year and was conducted solely in English. Eligible studies comprised publications describing in vitro studies that presented the latest evidence on TCM intervention mechanisms in CMECs under diverse injury models.

ResultsA total of 63 papers were included in this study. According to the cell processing approach, 19 studies on ischemia or hypoxic injury models, 16 studies on Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) or hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury models, 10 studies on inflammatory injury models, 5 studies on metabolic injury models, 3 studies on angiotensin II injury models, and 10 studies on other models. TCM exhibits structural and functional intervention capabilities in diverse damage conditions of CMECs. Its mechanism of action involves antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory effects, as well as regulation of energy metabolism through signaling pathways such as HIF-1/VEGF, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and NF-{kappa}B.

ConclusionsThe CCM and its constituents modulate CMECs through multiple signaling pathways in response to various injury models, thereby conferring protection on the coronary microcirculation.

While most PHD fingers recognize unmodified and methylated states of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), the specific functions of many of the over 100 PHD finger-containing proteins in humans remain poorly understood, despite their significant implications in disease processes. In this study, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of one such poorly characterized PHD finger-containing protein, PHRF1. Using biochemical, molecular, and cellular approaches, we show that PHRF1 robustly binds to histone H3, specifically at its N-terminal region. Through RNA-seq and proteomic analyses, we also find that PHRF1 is intricately involved in transcriptional and RNA splicing regulation and plays a significant role in DNA damage response (DDR). Crucially, mutagenesis of proline 221 to leucine (P221L) in the PHD finger of PHRF1 abolishes histone interaction and fails to rescue defective DDR. These findings underscore the importance of PHRF1-H3 interaction in maintaining genome integrity and provide insight into how PHD fingers contribute to chromatin biology.",NA,biorxiv

Approaches with simple joint stability constraints were previously introduced imposing an upper limit on the direction of the contact force to stay within a specified stability perimeter. Such approaches predicted higher rotator cuff muscle activation than without constraints, but the estimated joint contact forces were oriented along the specified perimeter, raising questions about validity. In this study, several glenohumeral stability formulations were investigated, and tested against in vivo measurements of glenohumeral contact forces from the Orthoload dataset on one participant data in three dumbbell tasks: lateral raise, posterior raise, and and anterior raise. The investigated formulations either imposed inequality constraints on the contact force direction to remain within a stability perimeter whose shape was varied, or added a penalty term as a criterion measure to the objective function that made the objective function costly for contact force directions to deviate from the glenoid cavity center. All stability formulations predicted contact force magnitudes that agreed relatively well to the in vivo measured forces except for the strictest formulation that constrained the joint contact force to be directed at the glenoid cavity center. Models that restricted the force direction to lie within a specified shape estimated force vectors that largely lay along the perimeters. Models that instead penalized force directions that deviated from the glenoid cavity center estimated relatively more accurate contact force directions within the glenoid cavity, though still not entirely in agreement with in vivo measurements. Our findings support the proposed penalty formulations as more reasonable and accurate than other investigated existing glenohumeral stability formulations.

Author summaryIn musculoskeletal models, the glenohumeral joint is often simplified as a purely rotational joint with no translation, whereas the actual joint movement involves both rotation and some translation, requiring stabilizing forces to prevent dislocation. Models that compute muscle forces based on a minimal effort strategy without specifically addressing glenohumeral stability may underestimate co-activation of the stabilizing rotator cuff muscles, and inaccurately predict that the contact force between the humerus and the glenoid is directed outside the articular surface of the joint. In this study, we compared existing stability models and proposed a new approach that penalized joint contact force whose direction deviates from the glenoid cavity center. We integrated these approaches into a muscle redundancy solver and estimated muscle and joint forces using the thoracoscapular shoulder musculoskeletal model. We compared model estimates to in vivo measurements of joint contact forces. We found that the penalty formulation reproduced the contact force direction most accurately, and promoted greater muscle co-contraction. These findings support the proposed penalty approach as a benchmark for more accurate analysis of shoulder biomechanics using musculoskeletal simulations.",NA,biorxiv

Conceptually, the niche space constrains the size of a stem-cell pool, as the cells sharing the niche compete for its space. It has been suggested that either neutral-or non-neutral-competition of stem cells changes the clone dynamics of stem cells. Theoretically, if the rate of asymmetric division is high, the stem cell competition is limited, thus suppressing clonal expansion. However, the effects of asymmetric division on clone dynamics have never been experimentally tested. Here, using the Drosophila germline stem cell (GSC) system, as a simple model of the in-vivo niche, we examine the effect of division modes (asymmetric or symmetric) on clonal dynamics by combining experimental approaches with mathematical modeling. Our results suggest that the rate of asymmetric division positively correlates with the time a stem cell clone takes to expand. Taken together, our data suggests that asymmetric division is essential for maintaining the genetic variation of stem cells and thus serves as a critical mechanism for safeguarding fertility over the animal age or preventing multiple disorders caused by the clonal expansion of stem cells.",NA,biorxiv

Studies have often equated the effects of knocking down one synthase with broader SAM-dependent outcomes such as histone methylation or phosphatidylcholine (PC) production. Humans and many other organisms express multiple SAM synthases. Evidence in Caenorhabditis elegans, which possesses four SAM synthase genes, suggest that the enzymatic source of SAM impacts its function. For instance, loss of sams-1 leads to enhanced heat shock survival and increased lifespan, whereas reducing sams-4 adversely affects heat stress survival. Here, we show that SAMS-1 contributes to a variety of intermediary metabolic pathways, whereas SAMS-4 is more important to generate SAM for methylation reactions. We demonstrate that loss of sams-1 exerts age-dependent effects on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression, mitochondrial metabolites, and may induce mitophagy. We propose a mechanistic model where reduced SAM from SAMS-1 acts through PC to impact mitochondria, thereby enhancing survival during heat stress.",NA,biorxiv

These stimulus dependencies have been argued to render synchrony among neural assemblies encoding components of the same object difficult. Alternatively, these dependencies may shape synchrony in meaningful ways. Using the theory of weakly coupled oscillators (TWCO), we demonstrate that stimulus dependence is crucial for gammas role in perception. Synchronization among coupled oscillators depends on frequency dissimilarity and coupling strength, which in early visual cortex relate to local feature dissimilarity and physical distance, respectively. We manipulated these factors in a texture segregation experiment wherein human observers identified the orientation of a figure defined by reduced contrast heterogeneity compared to the background. Human performance followed TWCO predictions both qualitatively and quantitatively, as formalized in a computational model. Moreover, we found that when enriched with a Hebbian learning rule, our model also predicted human learning effects. Increases in gamma synchrony due to perceptual learning predicted improvements in behavioral performance across sessions. This suggests that the stimulus-dependence of gamma synchrony is adaptable to the statistics of visual experiences, providing a viable neural grouping mechanism that can improve with visual experience. Together our results highlight the functional role of gamma synchrony in visual scene segmentation and provide a mechanistic explanation for its stimulus-dependent variability.",NA,biorxiv

Its input is gene-level P-values from any source, including omicsWAS, aggregation of GWAS P-values, CRISPR screens, or differential expression analysis. It is based on the idea that genes whose P-values are low due to sampling error are distributed randomly across networks and functions, so genes with suggestive P-values that cluster in densely connected subnetworks and share common functions are less likely to reflect sampling error and more likely to replicate. FISHNET combines network and function analysis with permutation-based P-value thresholds to identify a small set of exceptional genes that we call FISHNET genes.

Applied to 11 cardiovascular risk traits, FISHNET identified 19 gene-trait relationships that missed genome-wide significance thresholds but, nonetheless, replicated in an independent cohort. The replication rate of FISHNET genes matched or exceeded that of other genes with similar P-values. FISHNET identified a novel association between RUNX1 expression and HDL that is supported by experimental evidence that RUNX1 promotes white fat browning, which increases HDL cholesterol levels. FISHNET also identified an association between LTB expression and BMI that is supported by experimental evidence that higher LTB expression increases BMI via activation of the LT{beta}R pathway. Both associations failed genome-wide significance thresholds, highlighting FISHNETs ability to uncover meaningful relationships missed by traditional methods.

We propose a novel, run-length compressed index based on the move structure that enables efficient multi-class metagenomic classification in O(r) space, where r is the number of character runs in the BWT of the reference text. Our method identifies all super-maximal exact matches (SMEMs) of length at least L between a read and the reference dataset and associates each SMEM with one class identifier using a sampled tag array. A consensus algorithm then compacts these SMEMs with their class identifier into a single classification per read. We are the first to perform run-length compressed read classification based on full SMEMs instead of semi-SMEMs. We evaluate our approach on both long and short reads in two conceptually distinct datasets: a large bacterial pan-genome with few metagenomic classes and a smaller 16S rRNA gene database spanning thousands of genera or classes. Our method consistently outperforms SPUMONI 2 in accuracy and runtime while maintaining the same asymptotic memory complexity of O(r). Compared to Cliffy, we demonstrate better memory efficiency while achieving superior accuracy on the simpler dataset and comparable performance on the more complex one.

Sign epistasis is characterized by alleles having either a beneficial or detrimental effect depending on the genetic background, which can result in elite lines that fail as parents in certain parental combinations. Hence, the objective of this study were to test the existence of sign epistasis and examine its consequences to wheat breeding. The presence of sign epistasis is expected to distort the allele frequency distribution between two interacting genes compared to neutral sites, creating strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). To test this hypothesis, analysis of interchromosomal LD in breeding families was performed and detected 19 regions in strong disequilibrium, whose allele frequency distribution matched the sign epistasis prediction and falsified the competing hypothesis of additive selection. To validate these candidate interactions while avoiding the biases of a circular analysis and the confounding effects of genetic drift, two independent sets of populations were analyzed. Genetic drift was attributed to creating the sign epistasis patterns observed in eleven interactions, but there was not sufficient evidence to reject the sign epistasis hypothesis in eight interactions. Sign epistasis may explain the poor performance of elite lines as parents, as crossing lines with complementary allelic combination re-establishes epistatic variance in the offspring. Reduction in the effective population size in certain crosses may also occur when unfavorable sign epistatic combinations are deleterious. The potential existence of di-genic and higher order epistatic interactions in elite germplasm can tremendously impact breeding strategies as managing epistasis becomes imperative for success.",NA,biorxiv

The significant sequence variability of LCs has hindered understanding of the mechanisms driving LC aggregation. Nevertheless, emerging biochemical properties, including dimer stability, conformational dynamics, and proteolysis susceptibility, distinguish AL LCs from those in MM under native conditions. This study aimed to identify a conformational fingerprint distinguishing AL from MM LCs. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) under native conditions, we analyzed four AL and two MM LCs. We observed that AL LCs exhibited a slightly larger radius of gyration and greater deviations from X-ray crystallography-determined or predicted structures, reflecting enhanced conformational dynamics. SAXS data, integrated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, revealed a conformational ensemble where LCs adopt multiple states, with variable and constant domains either bent or straight. AL LCs displayed a distinct, low-populated, straight conformation (termed H state), which maximized solvent accessibility at the interface between constant and variable domains.

This approach has been extremely successful in cloning and studying transporters, for instance, plant amino acid, sugar, urea, ammonium, peptide, sodium, and potassium were characterized using yeast mutants lacking these functions. Over the years, new strains lacking even more endogenous transporters have been developed, enabling the characterization of transport properties of heterologous proteins in a more precise way. Furthermore, these strains provide the added advantage of characterization of a transporter belonging to a family of proteins in isolation, and thus can be used to study the relative contribution of redundant transporters to the whole function. We focused on amino acid transport; starting with the yeast strain 22{Delta}8AA, developed to clone plant amino acid transporters in the early 2000s. We recently deleted two additional amino acid permeases, Gnp1 and Agp1, creating 22{Delta}10. In the present work, five additional permeases (Bap3, Tat1, Tat2, Agp3, Bap2) were deleted from 22{Delta}10 genome in up to a combination of three at a time. Unexpectedly, the amino acid transport properties of the new strains were not very different from the parent, suggesting that these amino acid permeases play a minor role in amino acid uptake in our conditions. The inability to grow on a few amino acids as the sole nitrogen sources did not correlate with lower uptake activity, questioning the well-accepted relationship between lack of growth and loss of transport properties. Finally, in order to verify the mutations and the integrity of 22{Delta}10 genome, we performed whole-genome sequencing of 22{Delta}10 using long-read PacBio sequencing technology.

Short-read genome sequencing (sr-GS) enables CNV calling for genomic intervals of variable size and across multiple phenotypes. However, unresolved challenges include an overwhelming number of false-positive calls due to systematic biases from non-uniform read coverage and collapsed calls resulting from the abundance of paralogous segments and repetitive elements in the human genome.

MethodsTo address these interpretative challenges, we developed VizCNV. The VizCNV computational tool for inspecting CNV calls uses various data signal sources from sr-GS data, including read depth, phased B-allele frequency, as well as benchmarking signals from other SV calling methods. The interactive features and view modes are adept for analyzing both chromosomal abnormalities [e.g., aneuploidy, segmental aneusomy, and chromosome translocations], gene exonic CNV and non-coding gene regulatory regions. In addition, VizCNV includes a built-in filter schema for trio genomes, prioritizing the detection of impactful germline CNVs, such as de novo CNVs. Upon computational optimization by fine-tuning parameters to maximize sensitivity and specificity, VizCNV demonstrated approximately 83.8% recall and 77.2% precision on the 1000 Genome Project data with an average coverage read depth of 30x.

ResultsWe applied VizCNV to 39 families with primary immunodeficiency disease without a molecular diagnosis. With implemented build-in filter, we identified two de novo CNVs and 90 inherited CNVs >10 kb per trio. Genotype-phenotype analyses revealed that a compound heterozygous combination of a paternal 12.8 kb deletion of exon 5 and a maternal missense variant allele of DOCK8 are likely the molecular cause of one proband.

ConclusionsVizCNV provides a robust platform for genome-wide relevant CNV discovery and visualization of such CNV using sr-GS data.",NA,biorxiv

Perception of light quality via specialised photoreceptors signals the availability of sunlight for photosynthesis. Canopy shade is depleted in red (R) and enriched in far-red (FR) light, lowering R:FR ratio, while direct sunlight and sunflecks contain UV-B. The balance of these wavelengths can determine the developmental strategy adopted by seedlings to either avoid shade, via stem elongation, or promote the expansion of photosynthetic organs. How seedlings regulate stomatal movements in different light environments is poorly understood. Using FR and UV-B supplementation to mimic aspects of canopy shade and sunlight respectively, we monitored stomatal apertures in Arabidopsis thaliana cotyledons. We show that low R:FR inhibits stomatal opening via a mechanism involving PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) and increased abscisic acid (ABA). In contrast, UV-B perceived by the UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) photoreceptor antagonises this response to promote stomatal opening in a response requiring phototropin photoreceptors. The convergence of phytochrome and UVR8 signalling to control ABA abundance enables plants to coordinate stem elongation and water use during seedling establishment in dynamic light environments.",NA,biorxiv

The identities of the cells leaving the PS depend on both the time and the position at which they exit. Three signaling molecules, BMP4, WNT3 and NODAL, play key roles in determining these identities, but it has been difficult to disentangle the contribution of each to this process in the mouse embryo. Using 2D gastruloids that recapitulate early aspects of mouse gastrulation in vitro, we have previously shown that WNT3 and NODAL promote distal PS fates on their own, and proximal PS fates in the presence of BMP4. We now detail further the impact of BMP4 on the cell identities produced in gastruloids. Single cell RNA-seq analysis shows that prolonged exposure to BMP4 results in the presence of all the cell types, including primordial germ cells, which normally form from the most proximal part of the pluripotent epiblast. We then show that reducing the duration or intensity of gastruloid exposure to BMP4 can allow the emergence of more distal cell identities, such as paraxial mesoderm, alongside anterior PS derivatives. These results, which are consistent with embryological studies, provide key elements for understanding how the varied output of the PS is controlled.",NA,biorxiv

In humans, loss of ATRX function leads to ATRX syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. ATRX mutation in human cell lines is associated with multiple phenotypes including activation of the alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT) pathway, upregulation of retrotransposons and increased sensitivity to replication stress. However, the principal role of ATRX and the reason why its mutation causes such diverse phenotypes is currently unclear. To address this, we studied the role of ATRX in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that loss of XNP-1, the C. elegans homologue of ATRX, recapitulates many human phenotypes. In addition, XNP-1 is required to repress the inappropriate activation of germline genes. Importantly, this germline misexpression correlates with most of the phenotypes observed in xnp-1 animals. Seemingly distinct xnp-1 phenotypes such as developmental abnormalities and telomeric defects are both suppressed by mutation of the germline transcription factor gsox-1. These findings suggest that the majority of XNP-1-dependent phenotypes stem from its role in maintaining proper cellular identity, offering insights into the functions of ATRX in humans.",NA,biorxiv

Corresponding theory centers around the R* rule, according to which consumers who share a single limiting resource cannot coexist. Here we model motile consumers that directly interfere while handling resources, mechanistically capturing both exploitative and interference competition. Our analytical coexistence conditions show that interference competition readily promotes coexistence. In contrast to previous theory, coexistence does not require intra-specific interference propensities to exceed inter-specific interference propensities, nor for interference behaviors to carry a direct (rather than merely an opportunity) cost. The underlying mechanism of coexistence can resemble the hawk-dove game, the dominance-discovery trade-off (akin to the competition-colonization trade-off), or a novel trade-off we call the ""dove-discovery trade-off"", depending on parameter values. Competitive exclusion via the R* rule occurs only when differences in exploitative abilities swamp other differences between species, and more easily when differences in R* reflect different search speeds than when they reflect different handling times.

The tendency of these repetitive DNA sequences to form non-B DNA structures can cause abnormal replication, leading to genomic instability. This instability contributes to disease progression, though the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We investigated the replication of DNA containing CAG and CTG trinucleotide repeats using individual components of the T7 bacteriophage replication machinery, as well as the complete replisome. Our results show that repeats in linear single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) inhibit the activity of T7 DNA polymerase and ssDNA-binding proteins, with a more pronounced effect observed in CTG repeats compared to CAG repeats. Minicircle templates containing CTG repeats exhibited robust DNA synthesis on both the leading and lagging strands, though synthesis was not enhanced by the T7 gene 2.5 ssDNA-binding protein. The lagging strand products generated from the CTG repeat minicircle were significantly longer than those from random sequence templates, and their lengths were not extended by the presence of T7 gene 2.5 protein. When the repeated sequences were incorporated into the T7 phage genome, heterogeneity was observed downstream of the repeats, depending on their length. We propose that aberrant extension occurs predominantly in the lagging strand, driven by dynamic interactions between the repeated sequences and the DNA replisome. This study may provide a foundation for understanding the mechanisms underlying the extension or deletion of repetitive genomic regions.",NA,biorxiv

Bilaterality of amniote embryos becomes recognizable as midline morphogenesis begins at gastrulation, bisecting an embryonic field into the left and right sides, and left-right asymmetry patterning follows. While a series of laterality genes expressed after the left-right compartmentalization has been extensively studied, the laterality patterning prior to and at the initiation of midline morphogenesis has remained unclear. Here, through a biophysical quantification in a high spatial and temporal resolution, applied to a chick model system, we show that a large-scale bilateral counter-rotating cellular flow, termed as  polonaise movements, display left-right asymmetries in early gastrulation. This cell movement starts prior to the formation of the primitive streak (the earliest midline structure) and the subsequent appearance of Hensens node (the left-right organizer). The cellular flow speed and vorticity unravel the location and timing of the left-right asymmetries. The bilateral flows displayed a Right dominance after six hours since the start of cell movements. Mitotic arrest that diminishes primitive streak formation resulted in changes in the bilateral flow pattern, but the Right dominance persisted. Our data indicate that the left-right asymmetry in amniote gastrula becomes detectable earlier than suggested by current models, which assume that the asymmetric regulation of the laterality signals at the node leads to the left-right patterning. More broadly, our results suggest that physical processes can play an unexpected but significant role in influencing left-right laterality during embryonic development.

Significance StatementBilaterians are defined by a bilaterally symmetrical body plan. Vertebrates exhibit external bilateral symmetry but display left-right (LR) asymmetry in their internal organs. Amniote embryos switch the patterning of internal organs from bilateral symmetry to LR-asymmetry. Using chick embryos as a model system, here we examined the initiation of LR symmetry breaking. Our biophysical approaches to quantify cellular flows inferred that LR symmetry breaking occurs before the formation of Hensens node, a LR organizer, which serves as a signaling center for LR patterning-gene programs. Our work demonstrates that quantitative biophysical parameters can help unravel the initiation of LR symmetry breaking, suggesting an involvement of physical mechanisms in this critical biological patterning process.",10.1073/pnas.2414860122,biorxiv

Two distinct mechanisms underpin multicellularity5: clonal development (serial cell division of a single precursor cell) and aggregation (in which independent cells assemble into a multicellular entity). Clonal and aggregative development are traditionally considered mutually exclusive1,6-9, and evolutionary hypotheses have addressed why multicellular development might diverge toward one or the other extreme3,4. Both animals and their sister group, the choanoflagellates, are currently thought to only develop clonally10,11, apparently supporting an exclusively clonal pre-history for animal multicellularity4,12. Here, we show that the choanoflagellate Choanoeca flexa, one of the closest living relatives of animals13, develops into motile and contractile monolayers of cells (or ""sheets"") through an unexpectedly mixed, plastic mechanism: C. flexa sheets can form by purely clonal processes, purely aggregative processes, or a combination of both. We characterize the life history of C. flexa in its natural environment, ephemeral splash pools on the island of Curacao, and show that multicellular development is controlled by salinity during natural cycles of splash pool evaporation and refilling. Different splash pools house genetically distinct strains of C. flexa between which aggregation is constrained by kin recognition, a hallmark of aggregative multicellularity14-17.

To reach this persistent state, EBV activates and drives proliferation of the infected B cell. In vitro, these EBV-infected cells can grow almost indefinitely as a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). EBVs transcription profile in LCLs (Latency III) produces six nuclear proteins (EBNAs), two latency membrane proteins (LMPs) and various non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs from the BHRF1 gene locus and the BamA-rightward transcripts (BARTs).

Here we have conducted a nanopore direct RNA-seq analysis of the LCL transcriptome of the widely used B95-8 BAC clone, including viruses with engineered variations (barcodes) in the first and last repeat of internal repeat 1 (IR1). Our pipeline ensures appropriate mapping of the W promoter (Wp) 5 exon, and corrects W1-W2 exon counts that misalign to IR1. Characterisation of EBNA reads revealed that transcripts using Wp more frequently encoded the EBNA-LP start codon than Cp transcripts; identified a novel splice donor in exon W2 and polyA site just before the EBNA2 start codon; provided insights into BHRF1 miRNA processing; and suggested co-ordination between polyA site usage and alternative splicing decisions, although improved read depth and integrity are required to confirm this. The BAC region disrupts the integrity of BART transcripts through premature polyadenylation and cryptic splice sites in the antisense of the hygromycin expression cassette. Finally, we identified a few extended reads that cross established gene boundaries, running from EBNA, to BART to LMP2 gene regions, including some novel exon usage between EBNA1 and the BART promoter that may have more relevance or abundance in other phases of the EBV lifecycle.

This work deals with a theoretical model based on the hypothesis that an intermediate ectosymbiosis might have evolved before complete endosymbiosis. Assuming an already syntrophic environment of free-living hosts and symbionts, we investigate how obligate ectosymbiosis can evolve between the individuals of different species. An asymmetric multilevel selection approach is considered to mechanistically analyze the driving factors in the formation and fixation of the symbiotic consortia. A metabolite-based growth rate and growth inhibition are utilized to effectively model the ecological selection dynamics between the host and the symbiont species. We observed that reduced metabolic growth inhibition due to the effective reduction in exposure to toxic metabolites by the common surface area of contact might be an incentive to stabilize the ectosymbiotic consortia. Furthermore, robust syntrophy between the host and their ectosymbionts might have facilitated obligacy in their association.

When the environment changes, a previously efficient energy allocation strategy may become inefficient in the new environment, and organisms are required to change their physiology, morphology, and behaviour. However, how multiple phenotypic traits interact with each other and with the characteristics of the environment to determine energy allocation is poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we develop a predictive framework, based on energetic and biophysical principles, to characterise phenotype-environment interactions. We tested this by adapting axenic populations of the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis to different environmental conditions of temperature and resource levels, and measured population growth, cell size, respiration, and movement. Movement speed and respiration rate increased with acute changes in environmental temperature in a way that could be predicted from simple physical scaling relations such as the Boltzmann-Arrhenius equation and the  viscous drag impacting movement. Based on theoretical arguments, we argue that these short-term changes of metabolic rate and movement speed introduce a mismatch between energy intake and energy expenditure and are not sustainable on the long-term. In fact, by around 3.5 days after the introduction of Tetrahymena into a novel environment, all measured quantities were further modulated in a direction that likely restored the energy allocation balance of the cells. Changes in cell size played a substantial role in mediating these adaptations, by simultaneously affecting multiple phenotypic traits, such as metabolic rate and the energetic costs of movement.

Changes in body size can therefore be effectively leveraged - alongside physiological and biochemical regulations - to cope with environmental changes.",NA,biorxiv

Many analytical tasks are performed using commercially available immunochemistry based lateral flow tests, where the results are detected via a direct observation of the color change of the test strip. However, these tests in many cases do not have the desired levels of selectivity and/or sensitivity or even in some cases introduce an unwanted degree of subjectivity and thus uncertainty. Here, we developed a novel lateral flow analysis test designed for easy-to-run and easily to-interpret detection implementing surface enhanced Raman scattering. The strip utilizes modular polymeric sections specifically engineered to simplify the separation of target analytes from complex biological samples. This separation relies on a series of carefully designed physicochemical interactions between the sample components and the polymeric materials embedded in the strip. A key feature of this detection method is an analytical area on the strip that incorporates plasmonic silver nanostructures with a possibility of further surface functionalization using various selectors. We evaluated this test on the selective detection of IgG through its antibody and Adenine, as representatives of proteins and low molecular compounds. This innovative test format combines modular design with advanced detection, offering significant potential for applications in biomedical research, diagnostic testing, and monitoring of immune function.

Targeted studies of a series of monogenic ASDs have revealed postsynaptic dysfunction as a central conserved mechanism. Presynaptic dysfunction is emerging as an additional disease locus in neurodevelopmental disorders, however it is unclear whether this dysfunction drives ASDs or is an adaptation to the altered brain microenvironment. To determine this, we performed a high content analysis of key stages of the synaptic vesicle lifecycle in a series of preclinical models of monogenic ASDs. These models were specifically selected to have perturbations in a diverse palette of genes that were expressed either at the pre- or post-synapse. However, all models displayed a common trait of hyperexcitability. We determined that SV fusion events and SV cargo trafficking were unaffected in all models investigated. However, a key convergent phenotype was revealed, a depression in activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). This suggests that the depression in ADBE is a homeostatic mechanism to correct hyperexcitability in the ASD brain.",NA,biorxiv

However, the experimental design choice of which regions of a tissue will be imaged can greatly impact the interpretation of spatial quantifications. That is, spatial relationships identified in one region of interest may not be interpreted consistently across other regions. To address this challenge, we introduce Kontextual, a method which considers alternative frames of reference for contextualising spatial relationships. These contexts may represent landmarks, spatial domains, or groups of functionally similar cells which are consistent across regions. By modelling spatial relationships between cells relative to these contexts, Kontextual produces robust spatial quantifications that are not confounded by the region selected. We demonstrate in spatial proteomics and spatial transcriptomics datasets that modelling spatial relationships this way is biologically meaningful. We also demonstrate how this approach can be used in a classification setting to improve prediction of patient prognosis.",NA,biorxiv

We then identified 19,432 age-associated CpGs (aaCpGs) that were strongly correlated with age and showed high consistency between sexes, with faster methylation changes observed in males. Most aaCpGs were identified during early and late life stages, indicating accelerated epigenetic changes during development and aging. No specific genomic enrichment was observed. Clustering analysis revealed four distinct, non-linear age-related methylation trajectories. These findings underscore the complexity of epigenetic aging and suggest that current clocks may overlook important dynamic patterns, particularly after age 65.

How mechanically interconnected tissues coordinate in organismal development remains largely unexplored. During C. elegans elongation, cyclic forces generated by muscle contractions induce remodeling of adherens junctions and the actin cytoskeleton in the epidermis, facilitating gradual embryo lengthening. While previous studies have identified key players in epidermal cells, understanding how muscle cells coordinate their activity for proper embryo elongation remains unsolved. Using a Calcium sensor to monitor muscle activity during elongation, we identified two cells in each muscle quadrant with a leader cell function that orchestrate muscle activity within their respective quadrants. Strikingly, ablation of these cells halted muscle contractions and delayed elongation. A targeted RNAi screen focusing on communication channels identified two innexins and two Deg channels regulating muscle activity, which proved required for normal embryonic elongation.

Biomechanics is an important contributor to pregnancy success, and alterations to normal uterine biomechanical functions can contribute to an array of obstetric pathologies. Few studies have characterized the passive mechanical properties of the gravid human uterus, and ethical limitations have largely prevented the investigation of mid-gestation periods. To address this key knowledge gap, this study seeks to characterize the structural, compositional, and time-dependent micro-mechanical properties of the nonhuman primate (NHP) uterine layers in nonpregnancy and at three time-points in pregnancy: early 2nd, early 3rd, and late 3rd trimesters. Distinct material and compositional properties were noted across the different tissue layers, with the endometrium-decidua being the least stiff, most viscous, least diffusible, and most hydrated layer of the NHP uterus. Pregnancy induced notable compositional and structural changes to the endometrium-decidua and myometrium, but no micro-mechanical property changes. Further comparison to published human data revealed notable similarities across species, with minor differences noted for the perimetrium and nonpregnant endometrium. This work provides insights into the material properties of the NHP uterus and demonstrates the validity of NHPs as a model for studying certain aspects of human uterine biomechanics.",NA,biorxiv

Multidrug resistant (MDR) and methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) lineages have disseminated globally in the last decade and present significant treatment challenges. However, little is known regarding the factors that contribute to the success of MDR lineages. In this study, we compared the genome sequence of 110 UK isolates of S. pseudintermedius to 2,166 genomes of S. pseudintermedius populations from different continents. A novel core genome multi-locus typing scheme was generated to allow large scale, rapid and detailed analysis of S. pseudintermedius phylogenies, and was used to show that the S. pseudintermedius population structure is broadly segregated into an MDR population and a non-MDR population. MRSP lineages are predicted to either encode certain resistance genes chromosomally, or on plasmids, and this is associated with their MLST sequence type. Comparison of lineages most frequently implicated in disease, ST-45 and ST-71, with the phylogenetically related ST-496 lineage that has a comparatively low disease rate, revealed that ST-45 and ST-71 genomes encode distinct combinations of phage-defence systems and concurrently encode a high number of intact prophages. In contrast, ST-496 genomes encode a wider array of phage defence systems and lack intact, complete prophages. Additionally, we show that distinct prophages are widespread in S. pseudintermedius and appear to account for the vast majority of genomic diversity. These findings indicate that MRSP lineages have significant structural genomic differences, and that prophage integration, and differential antiviral systems correlate with the emergence of successful genotypes.

Impact StatementStaphylococcus pseudintermedius is a major cause of soft tissue infections in dogs but may occasionally infect other companion animals and humans, most often veterinary professionals in primary care. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) have emerged worldwide and are often linked to resistance to multiple antimicrobials, resulting in a significant health burden. Here, we analysed a large collection of S. pseudintermedius genome sequences, which has allowed a detailed characterisation of the molecular epidemiology and diversity of the species using a novel typing scheme.

Here we show that closely related MRSP lineages differ in whether specific antibiotic resistance genes are encoded on potentially mobilisable plasmids, or more stably on the chromosome, indicating differing evolutionary trajectories of MRSP lineages. Comparison of the S. pseudintermedius types most frequently implicated in clinical cases to those associated with commensal carriage, showed that known genes thought to contribute to disease are universal, and therefore, not associated with the high incidence rates of disease of particular lineages. We demonstrate that MRSP sequence types linked to high disease rates lack specific phage-defence systems and are associated with a high burden of prophages.

We also exposed intertidal species to a cold exposure mimicking a freezing event in the intertidal and measured survival post-exposure. We found that IBP activity was widespread across intertidal species, and that species with the highest degree of freeze tolerance also display ice nucleating activity attributable to proteins.

This discrimination is highly specific to the affinity of the bond between ligand and T cell receptors (TCRs), as well as highly sensitive to the concentration of ligand. In this study, we examined these features of T cell mediated immunity in the context of multivalent ligand-receptor interactions between clusters of TCRs with pMHC-coated nanoparticles (NPs). Using Monte Carlo simulations of NP-T cell surface interactions, we compared the effect of TCR clustering on the dose-response profiles of various NP designs. These simulations revealed a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, mediated by the spatial clustering of TCRs and the geometry of the NP. In particular, large clusters of TCRs were more sensitive to both NP valence and ligand concentration at the expense of antigen specificity. Conversely, uniformly distributed TCR landscapes were better suited to affinity-based ligand discrimination, while sacrificing sensitivity to ligand concentration. These features of NP-mediated T cell activation depended significantly on NP size and valence rather than on the average ligand concentration. Furthermore, we demonstrated how kinetic proofreading mechanisms may help compensate for the limitations associated with TCR clustering. These findings thus highlight the importance of interacting geometries of NP design and TCR landscape in modulating the specificity and sensitivity of the T cell response.

SignificanceT cells rely on surface T cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize foreign antigens presented as peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules. TCR clustering is crucial for T cell activation, though its full role remains not entirely clear. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that TCR clustering profoundly influences both surface binding dynamics of multivalent pMHC-coated nanoparticles, used in autoimmune disease therapies, as well as downstream intracellular signals leading to T cell activation. Our findings thus provide important insights into the role of interaction geometries in shaping T cell response, with implications for optimizing nanoparticle design to enhance their therapeutic efficacy.",NA,biorxiv

Previous studies have primarily focused on comparing organic and conventional farming, with a particular emphasis on land-use intensification, with less attention on the impact of pesticides. Our study examined the impact of herbicide, fungicide, and insecticide use - both in terms of Treatment Frequency Index (TFI), i.e. intensity of application, and quantity - on weed communities in 96 non-organic cereal fields over 4 years. Interestingly, our results indicate that fungicide application intensity decreased weed abundance by 11.6% and species richness by 14.6% for each one-standard-deviation (1-SD) increase in TFI, whereas the total quantity applied (QA) did not. In contrast, for herbicides, QA had a stronger negative impact on weed communities than TFI, with a 14.3% decrease in weed abundance and a 12.4% decrease in species richness for each 1-SD increase in QA. This suggests that TFI of fungicide, which may reflect low-dose but frequent applications, could exert indirect and long-term effects on weed suppression, potentially by altering symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soil. In comparison, QA of herbicide more directly reflects the toxic load delivered to weeds and is therefore a better predictor of their suppression. Based on a combination of multivariate and univariate analyses and the study of underlying mechanisms in community changes, our results reveal that herbicides are the main factor shaping weed communities by decreasing the abundance of non-target/non-competitive species while replacing them by problematic, competitive to crops, weed species. These findings point out the potential ineffectiveness of herbicides application on problematic weeds and emphasize the need to reconsider the use of herbicides to maintain weed diversity in agricultural landscapes.",NA,biorxiv

In vivo, MyD88-CD40 CARs expanded dramatically, comprising up to 100% of peripheral T cells and significantly outperforming canonical CD28- and 4-1BB-based CARs. This expansion was associated with robust B-cell depletion across all animals. MyD88-CD40 CARs, particularly those with a CD28 hinge and transmembrane domain, demonstrated superior trafficking to secondary lymphoid tissues and persistence through study endpoint, unlike other CARs which waned by day 28. Our findings highlight the value of NHP models for screening CAR designs and identify MyD88-CD40 CARs as candidates with unmatched potency. The unique functional attributes conferred by this domain may provide key insights into features that drive enhanced CAR-T cell activity.

Key pointsO_LIWe developed the first pooled CAR-T screening platform in an immunocompetent nonhuman primate model to directly compare CAR designs.
C_LIO_LIWe identified MyD88-CD40 costimulatory domain as vastly superior to conventional domains in proliferation, trafficking and persistence.

This study reproduces and validates the AF2Rank pipeline, which utilizes AlphaFolds intrinsic confidence metrics--predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) and predicted Template Modeling score (pTM)--to evaluate and rank decoy protein structures without dependence on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). The pipeline was implemented locally using the Rosetta decoy dataset, overcoming reproducibility challenges such as software dependency conflicts, residue indexing inconsistencies, and system-level execution issues. This framework successfully enabled high-confidence evaluation of over 1000 decoys for a benchmark target (1a32), with ongoing expansion to 133 protein targets.

Notably, we discovered that AlphaFold confidence metrics encode protein-specific ""fingerprints,"" enabling reverse classification of structures to their source proteins. Our XGBoost-based classifier achieved 61.5% accuracy across 133 distinct protein targets, substantially exceeding random chance (0.75%). Feature importance analysis revealed that traditional energy functions (Rosetta normalized score, 26%) and derived interaction features (pLDDT-pTM ratio, 16%) provide the strongest discriminative power, suggesting AlphaFold metrics capture meaningful biological and structural information beyond generic quality assessment. Building upon this foundation, a novel hypothesis is introduced: Context-Aware Refinement of AlphaFold Predictions (CAR-AF). This approach postulates that AlphaFold-predicted structures may be further improved through refinement in the presence of their native binding partners--such as receptors or ligands--thereby producing conformations that are both structurally and functionally enhanced. The proposed methodology comprises four stages: generation of initial predictions via AlphaFold, structural modeling of relevant binding partners, docking of predicted proteins into these biological contexts, and refinement of the resulting complexes using molecular modeling tools such as Rosetta or HADDOCK. Structural and energetic metrics including TM-score, RMSD, and binding energy will be used to assess potential improvements in predictive quality.",NA,biorxiv

The regulation of each alternative splicing event involves the coordinated action of multiple RNA-binding proteins, creating a diverse array of alternatively spliced products. Dysregulation of alternative splicing is associated with various diseases, including neurodegeneration. Here we demonstrate that CELF2, a splicing regulator and a GWAS-identified risk factor for Alzheimers disease, binds to mRNAs associated with neurodegenerative diseases, with a specific interaction observed in the intron adjacent to exon 10 on Tau mRNA. Loss of CELF2 in the mouse brain results in a decreased inclusion of Tau exon 10, leading to a reduced 4R:3R ratio. Further exploration shows that the hinge domain of CELF2 possesses an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which mediates CELF2 condensation and function. The functionality of IDR in regulating CELF2 function is underscored by its substitutability with IDRs from FUS and TAF15. Using TurboID we identified proteins that interact with CELF2 through its IDR. We revealed that CELF2 co-condensate with NOVA2 and SFPQ, which coordinate with CELF2 to regulate the alternative splicing of Tau exon 10. A negatively charged residue within the IDR (D388), which is conserved among CELF proteins, is critical for CELF2 condensate formation, interactions with NOVA2 and SFPQ, and function in regulating tau exon 10 splicing. Our data allow us to propose that CELF2 regulates Tau alternative splicing by forming condensates through its IDR with other splicing factors, and that the composition of the proteins within the condensates determines the outcomes of alternative splicing events.",NA,biorxiv

Preclinical literature remains conflicted regarding the underlying neurobehavioral mechanisms, reporting mixed effects of CBD (increased, decreased, or no effect) on anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. Preclinical data demonstrated that CBD modulates hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis gene expression; it is unknown whether CBD changes HPA axis responsivity and how this relates to altered behavior.

ObjectivesWe aimed to evaluate whether acute or chronic CBD administration would alter physiological and behavioral measures of HPA axis responsivity in male or female mice.

MethodsC57BL/6 mice of both sexes were injected with vehicle or CBD (30 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 26 days. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels were evaluated following dexamethasone suppression and adrenocorticotropin hormone stimulation tests after acute and chronic CBD exposure. After chronic CBD, mice were tested for anxiety-like behavior using an elevated plus maze (EPM) and associative fear learning and memory using a trace fear conditioning (FC) protocol.

ResultsCompared to vehicle, CBD induced a state of HPA axis hyperactivation, an effect which was significant in males; it also normalized anxiety-like behavior in female mice classified as having HPA axis hypofunction and primed all female mice for enhanced conditioned responding. Significant sex differences were also detected: females had greater plasma CORT levels and HPA axis responsivity than males, exhibited less EPM anxiety-like behavior, and were more responsive during FC.

ConclusionsCBD potentiated physiological and behavioral markers of HPA axis function and normalized anxiety-like behavior in a sex-specific manner. This observation has implications for cannabinoid-based drug development targeting individuals with stress-related disorders involving HPA axis hypofunction pathology.",NA,biorxiv

A classic example is the perception of unfairness operationalized in the Ultimatum Game where humans readily sacrifice personal gains to punish those who violate fairness norms. While the emotional mechanism underlying costly punishments has been widely acknowledged, the distinct contributions of moral emotions (anger or disgust) remain debated, partly due to methodological limitations of the conventional experiments. Here, we capitalize on a quantitative neurofunctional dissection approach by combining recent developments in neuroimaging meta-analyses, behavioral-level, network-level, and neurochemical-level decoding and data from 3,266 participants from functional neuroimaging studies to determine the common and distinct neural representations between unfairness and the two moral emotions. Experience of unfairness engaged a widespread bilateral network encompassing insular, cingulate, and frontal regions, with dorsal striatal regions mediating the decision to reject unfair offers. Disgust engaged a defensive-avoidance circuit encompassing amygdalar, occipital, and frontal regions, while anger engaged non-overlapping systems including mid-cingulate, thalamic, and frontal regions. Unfairness and anger or disgust respectively commonly engaged the anterior and mid-insula, while the latter additionally showed common recruitment of ventrolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices. Multimodal network, behavioral, and serotonergic decoding provided a more granular and convincing dissection of these results. Findings indicate a shared neuroaffective basis underlying the impact of emotions on unfairness-induced punishment behavior and suggest a common brain circuit has been evolutionarily shaped to protect individuals from personal harm and enforce societal norms.",NA,biorxiv

However, current analysis methods often depend on a high-quality reference genome and gene annotation. Recently, de novo assembly methods have been developed to utilise long-read data in cases where a reference genome is unavailable, such as in non-model organisms. Despite the potential of these tools, there remains a lack of benchmarking and established protocols for optimal reference-free, long-read transcriptome assembly and differential expression analysis.

Here, we comprehensively evaluate the current state-of-the-art long-read de novo transcriptome assembly tools, RATTLE, RNA-Bloom2 and isONform, and compare their performance to one of the leading short-read assemblers, Trinity. We assess various metrics, including assembly quality and computational efficiency, across a range of datasets, which include simulated data and spike-in sequin transcripts, where ground truth is known, and real data from human cell lines and pea (Pisum sativum) samples, using the reference-guided assembler Bambu to define truth. To represent contemporary analysis scenarios, the datasets cover depths from 6 million to 60 million reads, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) cDNA and direct RNA sequencing, and critically, we assessed the downstream impact of assembly choice on the detection of differential gene and transcript expression.

Our results confirm that long reads generate longer assembled transcripts than short-reads for reference-free analysis, though limitations remain compared to reference-guided approaches, and suggest scope for improved accuracy and redundancy. Of the de novo pipelines, RNA-Bloom2, coupled with Corset for transcript clustering, was the best performing in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings offer guidance when selecting the most effective strategy for long-read differential expression analysis, when a high-quality reference genome is unavailable.",NA,biorxiv

We developed a genetically defined sst1-susceptible mouse model that uniquely reproduces a defining feature of human TB: the development of necrotic lung granulomas and determined that the sst1-susceptible phenotype was driven by the aberrant macrophage activation. This study demonstrates that the aberrant response of the sst1-susceptible macrophages to prolonged stimulation with TNF is primarily driven by conflicting Myc and antioxidant response pathways leading to a coordinated failure 1) to properly sequester intracellular iron and 2) to activate ferroptosis inhibitor enzymes. Consequently, iron-mediated lipid peroxidation fueled Ifn{beta} superinduction and sustained the Type I Interferon (IFN-I) pathway hyperactivity that locked the sst1-susceptible macrophages in a state of unresolving stress and compromised their resistance to Mtb. The accumulation of the aberrantly activated, stressed, macrophages within granuloma microenvironment led to the local failure of anti-tuberculosis immunity and tissue necrosis. The upregulation of Myc pathway in peripheral blood cells of human TB patients was significantly associated with poor outcomes of TB treatment. Thus, Myc dysregulation in activated macrophages results in an aberrant macrophage activation and represents a novel target for host-directed TB therapies.",NA,biorxiv

This provides information about both demographic and adaptive processes acting on the population during that period. A common approach to analyze such data is to model observed allele counts in finite samples using a Hidden Markov model (HMM) where hidden states are true allele frequencies over time (i.e. a trajectory). The HMM framework allows to compute the full likelihood of the data, while accounting both for the stochastic evolution of population allele frequencies along time and for the noise arising from sampling a limited number of individuals at possibly spread out generations. Several such HMM methods have been proposed so far, differing mainly in the way they model the transition probabilities of the Markov chain. Following Paris et al. (2019a), we consider here the Beta with Spikes approximation, which avoids the computational issues associated to the Wright-Fisher model while still including fixation probabilities, in contrast to other standard approximations of this model like the Gaussian or Beta distributions. To facilitate the analysis and exploitation of genomic time series data, we present an improved version of Paris et al. (2019a)  s approach, denoted SelNeTime, whose computation time is drastically reduced and which accurately estimates effective population size in addition to the selection intensity at each locus.

Prior work in rats suggests that reflexive apneas (produced by stimulation of trigeminal or vagal peripheral sensory targets) is highly fatal during seizure but well tolerated otherwise. These reflexes share network connectivity in the medulla, particularly the caudal solitary nucleus (NTS) and ventral respiratory column (VRC), and possibly other intermediate structures. We sought to observe the electrographic activity in these regions.

MethodsWe use urethane anesthetized long evans rats. We utilized either 125 m silver wire in the caudal NTS or a Neuropixel 1.0 probe along a dorsoventral trajectory that spanned the caudal NTS to the VRC. We additionally recorded cardiorespiratory activity via several methods. We induced a reflexive apnea - the diving reflex - by nasal irrigation of cold water for several seconds, which produces a period of apnea, then gasping, and then a gradual return to eupnea. We repeated several trials while the animal was healthy and subsequently induced continuous seizure activity with kainate and repeated the reflexes, which are ultimately fatal during seizure.

ResultsSeizure activity confounds many established methods of analyzing high-density single unit data such as provided by Neuropixels probes, and so our analyses focus on averaging responses over larger anatomical regions (120 m) covering small populations of neurons. Seizure produces broad increases in neuronal activity across the medullary tract, which by itself is not dangerous. Ictal reflexive apneas were broadly more inhibitory (producing a reduction in firing rate) than they were preictally, and fatal ictal responses resulted in a very rapid shutdown of all medullary activity. We only rarely observed ictal central apneas (apneas with no apparent stimuli), but when we did they were apparently safe, always survived, and produced no significant change in network activity (neither increase nor decrease).

ConclusionsThese data support the theory that central apnea events in seizure are relatively safe as we observed they produce little change in the medullary tract network, while stimuli-induced-reflexive-apneas are dangerous because they produce profound quieting across respiratory centers. Our data suggest that seizure spreads to this medullary tract at approximately the same rate and intensity as forebrain, as previously described in this model. These data are supportive of SUDEP mechanisms involving brainstem inhibition as a primary cause, such as spreading depolarization waves. These findings likely extend beyond nasal irrigation to any sensory reflexive apnea caused by airway irritation of any kind, and may bear relevance to similar deaths seen in infants.",NA,biorxiv

Targeting multiple features in a biopsy using molecular or chemical reagents can enhance molecular phenotyping but are limited by overlap of their spatial and chromatic properties, variations in quality of the products, limited multimodal nature and need additional tissue processing. To overcome these limitations and increase the breadth of molecular information available from tissue without an impact on routine diagnostic workup, we implemented label-free imaging modalities including stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, second harmonic generation (SHG), and two photon fluorescence (TPF) into a single microscopy setup. We visualized and identified morphological, structural, lipidomic, and metabolic biomarkers of control and diabetic human kidney biopsy samples in 2D and 3D at a subcellular resolution. The label-free biomarkers, including collagen fiber morphology, mesangial-glomerular fractional volume, lipid saturation, redox status, and relative lipid and protein concentrations in the form of Stimulated Raman Histology (SRH), illustrate distinct features in kidney disease tissues not previously appreciated. The same tissue section can be used for routine diagnostic work up thus enhancing the power of cliniopathological insights obtainable without compromising already limited tissue. The additional multimodal biomarkers and metrics are broadly applicable and deepen our understanding of the progression of kidney diseases by integrating lipidomic, fibrotic, and metabolic data.

Their lifestyle is associated with fragmented environments, limited dispersal ability, and low fecundity. These characteristics all are expected to increase inter- and intrapopulation differentiation and reduce intra- population genetic diversity, yet the published empirical data revealed the lack of generality of this pattern. This emphasizes the importance of accumulating more data on individual species to understand what factors shape the genetic dynamics of populations. This study represents the first characterization of the population genetic diversity and fine-scale genetic structure of a highly specialized subterranean vole, Ellobius talpinus. We used nine microsatellite loci and a fragment of the mitochondrial D-loop to investigate genetic patterns of two distant populations: the Novosibirsk population at the extreme northeastern edge of the species range, and the sub-peripheral Saratov population. As a result, the two populations exhibit distinct patterns of genetic structure. The Novosibirsk population showed a low nuclear diversity with an observed heterozygosity (Ho) of 0.34 and an unbiased expected heterozygosity (uHe) of 0.55. Mitochondrial D-loop was nearly monomorphic with over 90% of the observed haplotypes being identical, resulting in a haplotype diversity (Hd) of 0.14 and nucleotide diversity ({pi}) of 0.0004. In contrast, the Saratov population displayed moderate nuclear (Ho = 0.64; uHe = 0.76) and high mitochondrial variation (Hd = 0.83;{pi} = 0.034), compared to the surface-dwelling voles. Nine haplotypes representing four well-differentiated mitochondrial clades were found in the Saratov population. In a heterogeneous landscape, significant genetic differentiation was revealed at both intermediate (dozens of kilometers) and fine (several kilometers) scales. However, within the continuous suitable habitat, no fine-scale spatial structure was observed apart from that caused by kin clustering. The spatial genetic patterns revealed in E. talpinus appear to reflect a combination of effects of strong social structure, local natural and anthropogenic barriers limiting dispersal opportunities, and occasional long-distance dispersal.",NA,biorxiv

Infections are associated with growth faltering and mortality in children and are often transmitted through contact with eggs in fecally contaminated soil. Interventions, like replacing household soil floors with cement-based alternatives, may reduce exposure to Ascaris eggs, but there are currently no estimates on the removal or survival of Ascaris eggs on cement-based surfaces. This study addresses that knowledge gap by evaluating the removal of Ascaris eggs from mopping and the survival of Ascaris eggs on two cement-based mixes: an Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) mortar and an OPC mortar with fly ash, which provides a more sustainable alternative to the OPC mortar mix. We assessed egg survival at two temperatures representing the dry (15{degrees}C) and wet (34{degrees}C) seasons in Bangladesh using two different egg enumeration methods. After mopping, over 92% of viable eggs were removed from surfaces, with no significant differences between cement-based mixes (p = 0.51). The first-order decay rate constants (k) of Ascaris eggs were similar between mix designs (p = 0.62) but varied significantly between temperatures (p = 4.2 x 10-25) and egg enumeration methods (p = 2.4 x 10-8). The k values were of greater magnitude at 34{degrees}C compared to at 15{degrees}C. At 15{degrees}C, k values were not significantly different from zero, indicating no inactivation. The k values we obtained were comparable to those reported in previous studies for different matrices, indicating comparable inactivation of Ascaris eggs on cement-based surfaces compared to liquid and semi-solid matrices. These results provide some of the first estimates of removal efficiencies and inactivation times in realistic environmental conditions for Ascaris on surfaces while supporting the use of OPC mortar mix designs with fly ash in interventions to reduce Ascaris transmission in rural LMIC households.

Author SummarySoil-transmitted helminths, like Ascaris, are parasites that are major contributors to disease in children and women of childbearing age in low- and middle-income countries. Interventions, like replacing soil floors in households with cement-based flooring, may reduce exposure to Ascaris eggs which cause infections, but there is little information on how or why these interventions may be effective. This study investigates the effectiveness of simple cleaning methods, like mopping, in removing Ascaris eggs from cement-based surfaces and explores how long these eggs can survive on these surfaces under different environmental conditions. We tested two types of cement-based surfaces, a traditional cement-based mortar mix, and a more sustainable cement-based mortar mix, and found that mopping removed over 92% of Ascaris eggs, with no differences between cement mixes. Experiments simulating wet and dry seasonal conditions showed that Ascaris eggs survive longer in cooler environments, again with no differences between cement mixes. These findings provide important insights into the role of cement-based flooring in interrupting disease transmission and suggest sustainable cement-based mortar mixes are a feasible alternative to traditional cement-based mortar mixes.",NA,biorxiv

We characterized their skeletal muscle phenotype over time, utilizing computer-aided tools applied to standardized parameters of muscle pathology and function. Knock-in mice exhibited early-onset reduced muscle weight, myopathic histology, increased fibrosis, reduced collagen VI expression, muscle weakness, and impaired respiratory function. These features provide adequate outcome measures to assess therapeutic interventions. The different automated image analysis methods deployed here analyze thousands of features simultaneously, enhancing accuracy in describing muscle disease models. Overall, the Col6a1 Ki Gly292Arg mouse model offers a robust platform to deepen our understanding of COL6-RD and advance its therapeutic landscape.

The genomes of Stratiomyidae are generally larger than Asilidae and contain a higher proportion of transposable elements, many of which are recently expanded. Gene families showing more gene duplications are enriched for life history related functions such as metabolism in Stratiomyidae and proteolysis and longevity in Asilidae. Gene families showing more gene duplications that are specific to H. illucens are mostly related to olfactory and immune responses, while across the Stratiomyidae there is enrichment of digestive and metabolic functions such as proteolysis.

Self-assembled polymeric nanoparticles (SANPs) have emerged as promising candidates due to their unique structural properties, which enhance membrane interaction, drug loading, and therapeutic accumulation. The structural diversity and tunable properties of SANPs provide a flexible design platform for antibacterial applications. However, navigating the vast chemical space of SANPs remains a significant challenge due to the complex structure-activity relationships. To address this, we developed PolyCLOVER, a deep learning-guided framework for the efficient discovery of antibacterial SANPs. The framework integrates multi-stage self-supervised learning, active learning, and high-throughput experimentation to iteratively guide the discovery of SANPs with potent antibacterial activity and low toxicity. Through this framework, we identified three potent SANPs within a combinatorial library of [~]100,000 poly({beta}-amino ester)s, with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 4 g/mL and 8 g/mL against clinically multidrug-resistant S. aureus and A. baumannii, respectively. Moreover, they can also act as antibiotic carriers, restoring the sensitivity of pathogens to penicillin G. In vivo studies demonstrated their therapeutic efficacy both as monotherapies and in combination therapies with antibiotics. These results demonstrate PolyCLOVER as a powerful framework for discovering multi-functional SANPs to combat antibiotic resistance.",NA,biorxiv

For example, those with PRKN loss of function mutations have significantly earlier selective vulnerability of dopamine neurons, those with SNCA mutations have increased alpha-synuclein deposition, while those with LRRK2 mutations have additional deposition of tau. Yet all three mutation types are implicated in mitochondrial and/or lysosomal dysfunction. Direct comparison of cell models with these mutations would clarify the relative cellular dysfunctions associated with these different pathological phenotypes.

MethodsAn unbiased high-content imaging platform using orthogonal probes to assess both lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction, along with alpha-synuclein and tau protein deposition was established using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived cortical and ventral midbrain neurons. Three mutation types, SNCA A53T, LRRK2 R1441G and PRKN loss of function (lof), were selected as exemplars of divergent PD pathological phenotypes and compared to each other, and to control iPSC from subjects without PD.

ResultsDifferent PD mutations caused cell type specific dysfunctions, likely to impact on both selective neuronal vulnerability and the pathologies observed in PD. Comparison of dopamine neurons identified that both lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction were predominant with PRKN lof mutations, whereas immunofluorescent staining revealed that SNCA A53T and LRRK2 R1441G mutations had increased tau deposition. In contrast, cortical neurons with SNCA and LRRK2 mutations both had mitochondrial and autophagy impairments without protein deposition, with LRRK2 cells additionally showing decreased glucocerebrosidase activity and increased alpha-synuclein phosphorylation.

ConclusionsLysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction are predominant in dopamine neurons with PRKN lof mutations, and may drive the early selective loss of dopamine neurons in PRKN mutation carriers. More subtle cellular abnormalities in the SNCA A53T cell lines are likely to predispose to alpha-synuclein aggregation and tau protein deposition over time. The LRRK2 R1441G may also predispose to tau deposition, but despite substantial lysosomal dysfunction with increased alpha-synuclein phosphorylation, pathological alpha-synuclein accumulations were not observed. Understanding the mechanistic differences in how lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction impact on PD pathogenesis in different disease subtypes may be important for therapeutic development.",NA,biorxiv

Almost all BREX systems also contain a site-specific methyltransferase (PglX aka BrxX). Despite having determined the structure and fundamental biophysical and biochemical behaviours for the PglX methyltransferase, the BrxL effector, the BrxA DNA-binding protein and the BrxR transcriptional regulator, the mechanism by which BREX impedes phage replication remains largely undetermined. In this study, we identify a stable BREX sub-complex of PglZ:BrxB, validate the structure and dynamic behaviour of that sub-complex, and assess the biochemical activity of PglZ, revealing it to be a metal-dependent nuclease. PglZ can cleave cyclic oligonucleotides, linear oligonucleotides, plasmid DNA and both non-modified and modified linear phage genomes. PglZ nuclease activity has no obvious role in BREX-dependent methylation, but does contribute to BREX phage defence. BrxB binding does not impact PglZ nuclease activity.

Understanding how crops respond to N fertilizer has become a central topic in plant science and plant genetics, with the ultimate goal of enhancing N use efficiency (NUE) in crop production. As one of the most essential macronutrients, N significantly influences crop performance across different developmental stages of plant, phenotypic traits result from the accumulative effects of genetic factors, prevailing environmental conditions (specifically N availability), and their complex interactions. To characterize the targeting N-responsiveness and growth trajectory, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 technique to generate sorghum mutants using CRISPR technology. Using a LemnaTec plant imaging system, we obtained time series imagery data from 29 to 130 days after sowing (DAS) for these CRISPR-edited mutants under high N and low N greenhouse conditions. After imagery data analysis, we extracted a number of morphological and greenness index traits as a proxy of plant growth and N responses. Subsequently, we employed two different methods to model the temporal N-responsive traits, allowing us to estimate seven key parameters from the growth curve. Our findings revealed that the wildtype and the edited sorghum lines exhibited differences in N responses for several of the key growth-related parameters.

To understand how the F-actin network is employed for the movement of peroxisomes, essential organelles in plant metabolism, we analyzed mutants of three villin (VLN) genes, which encode the primary actin-bundling factor and are most actively expressed in vegetative tissues in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that the vln4 mutation greatly exacerbated the growth and subcellular defects in vln2 vln3. Compared to the wild-type cells, the double and triple vln mutants exhibit progressive reduction of stable F-actin bundles and rapid remodeling of the fine filaments. The defective F-actin network did not prevent peroxisomes from taking on both rapid and slow movements along the tracks but caused significantly reduced speed of movement and displacement distance of peroxisomes. Using a correlation analysis method, we classified the complex heterogeneous peroxisome movement patterns into clusters reflecting distinct movement directionalities.

The ability to lyophilize, store, and use on demand makes these sensors usable in the field, and the lack of membranes means there are no analyte transport issues and new sensors can be deployed by simply adding a different DNA molecule. The lack of membranes also enables high-throughput screening of sensor designs and reaction optimizations. While shelf stability has been demonstrated in specific cases using additives, these approaches are not universal to the myriad cell-free expression methods and formats. Here, we present new high-throughput screening methods to optimize cell-free expression formulations when embedded into paper for use as sensors. Our method leverages acoustic liquid handling to dispense reactions onto 384-well paper ticket formats and machine vision to quantify reaction performance from a colorimetric reporter enzyme. The throughput enabled shifts the bottleneck from experimental execution to selecting the experiments to execute; we therefore implement design-of-experiments to optimize the information gained from each design-build-test-learn cycle. We used these approaches to first optimize the performance of a low-cost cell-free expression formulation that was initially non-functional when embedded in paper, then further optimize it for tolerance to heat exposure.

Subsequently, several sialoglycoproteins from PA have been identified which includes flagellin. In the current study, the sialylation status of PA flagellin has been further investigated through lectin and Siglecs binding. Siglecs are immunoglobulin-like receptors which can recognize and bind to sialic acids. The sialylated PA flagellin (Fla+Sia) was observed to bind with its cognate receptor TLR5 (Toll-like receptor 5) and also with Siglec-9 on dendritic cell (DC) surface. DCs are potent antigen-presenting phagocytic immune cells which can activate other immune cells through costimulation. Immature DCs undergo maturation upon encountering antigens; which involves changes in the cell morphology, receptors expression, cytokine secretion etc. Here, immature DCs stimulated with Fla+Sia or desialylated-Fla+Sia (ds-Fla+Sia) underwent maturation but exhibited different phenotypic and functional profiles. The Fla+Sia matured DCs showed relatively lower expression of costimulatory molecules, lower pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion, higher phagocytic activity and induced the generation of more Th (T helper) and Treg (regulatory T) cells. The impact of these two antagonistic signaling pathways-TLR5-based immune-activatory and immunosupressive Siglec-9 signaling on DC maturation was further explored in DCs generated from THP-1 cell line. Here, Fla+Sia stimulated DCs showed increased Siglec-9-SHP1 association while ds-Fla-Sia stimulation showed an increased TLR5 association with its interacting partners-MyD88/TRAF-6/IRAK-4. The TLR5/Siglec-9 signaling was disrupted through siRNA transfections or chemical inhibitor treatment which revealed that flagellin-based TLR5 stimulation was crucial for the initiation of robust cell signaling events. However, Fla+Sia treatment activated Siglec-9 signaling, which directly inhibited TLR5 pathway. Interestingly, downregulating Siglec-9 signaling resulted in enhanced TLR5 activation upon Fla+Sia stimulation, along with increased MAP kinase signaling and activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Thus, Siglec-9 silenced DCs responded to Fla+Sia with increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, the altered profile and T cell polarization ability of Fla+Sia matured DCs is caused by the Siglec-9-based disruption of TLR5 signaling.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we explore some ways that a sublinear predator-prey scaling could emerge from density-dependent interactions among predators and between predators and prey (which we call a top-down origin), rather than among prey (bottom-up origin) as proposed in Hatton et al.

First, we use phenomenological differential equations to explore the role of environmental parameters and dynamical properties in controlling the predator-prey ratio. Second, we simulate an agent-based model with tunable predator self-regulation to investigate the emergence of predator-prey scaling from plausible microscopic rules. While we cannot rule out alternative explanations, our results show that density-dependent mechanisms relative to predation and intraspecific predator interactions, including prey saturation, predator interference, and predator self-regulation, offer potential explanations for the predator-prey power law.",NA,biorxiv

To make strides towards this goal in a rapidly changing, exemplar marine ecosystem, the Baltic Sea, we studied basin-scale nitrifier spatio-temporal dynamics, coupled with enrichment-enabled comparative genomics. Based on metagenomes and rRNA gene sequencing, we found nitrifiers to be persistently relatively abundant throughout deep depths (>25 m), and from late-fall to spring in surface waters, as revealed by twice-weekly sampling across two years in the southwest Baltic Sea surface waters. In these surface waters, we observed time-lagged dynamics between ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizers, which were positively correlated with nitrite, nitrate, and diverse other prokaryotes, and negatively correlated with day length, light, and chlorophyll. For the dominant nitrifiers, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), we enriched five novel species including the dominant deep Baltic Sea species, and obtained genomes from all dominant AOA phylotypes. Among these genomes, which enabled fine-scale niche-differentiation, we observed a high degree of gene conservation, with most differences related to genes associated with interactions with the external environment, including genes involved in signal transduction, cell wall/membrane biogenesis, and inorganic ion transport, indicating these may be the primary drivers of strain-variability. We also observed differences in nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism between two dominant surface types. Together our study provides key insights into the niche of nitrifiers, and begins the process of understanding the mechanisms and functional implications of these patterns.",NA,biorxiv

Here, the results from more than 23 laboratories are presented. The primary purpose was to design experiments simulating typical casework circumstances; collect data and to implement Bayesian networks to assess the value (i.e., likelihood ratio) of DNA results given activity level propositions. Two different experimental designs were used to simulate a robbery, where a screwdriver was used to force a door or window. Propositions and case information were chosen following laboratory feedback listing typical casework circumstances (included in the paper). Whereas the proposition representing prosecutions view is applicable to many cases: the defendant forced the door/window with his screwdriver; the proposition representing defences view are more variable depending on what is alleged to have happened. In a direct transfer experiment, the defendant owned and used the screwdriver, but he did not force the door/window in question. An unknown person used the defendants stolen screwdriver. In an indirect transfer experiment, the defendant neither owned, saw, nor used the screwdriver, nor did they force the door or window. Instead, an unknown individual--someone with whom the defendant had interacted (e.g., by shaking hands or touching the same objects)--used the recovered tool to force entry. In the first experiment, if the defendant forced the door/window, then s/he is the last handler of the screw driver, whereas if the tool was stolen and used by an unknown person, the defendant is the first handler. For the second experiment, given the defence view, the defendant never held the screwdriver. We envisaged the situation where an object manipulated by the defendant (or the defendant himself/herself) would be touched by the unknown offender who would then force the window. The time delay between the touching of the object and the forcing of the window was 0, 1h, and 2h. This was accomplished by handshaking experiments, where the person forcing the door would shake a persons hand, and then use the screwdriver either immediately after hand-shake or after 1, 2 hours. It was found for the direct transfer experiment that unless a single contributor profile aligning with the known persons of interest profile was retrieved, the results did not allow to discriminate propositions. On the other hand, for the indirect transfer experiment, both single and major contributor profiles that aligned with the person of interest (POI) supported the proposition that the person used the tool rather than an unknown person who had touched an object, when indeed the former was true. There was considerable variation in median recoveries of DNA between laboratories (between 200pg - 5ng) for a given experiment if quantities are taken into account. These differences affect the likelihood ratios given activity level propositions. More than 2,700 samples were analysed in the course of this study. Two different Bayesian Networks are made available via an open source application written in Shiny R: Shiny_React(). For comparison, all datasets were analysed using a qualitative method categorised into absent, single, balanced or major given contributors.

The relative toxicity of dissolved arsenic is related to its speciation, with As(V) being less toxic than As(III). Microorganisms have various mechanisms of arsenic resistance, including efflux and methylation. Microorganisms may also perform reduction/oxidation of As(V)/As(III) as part of their detoxification and/or metabolic pathways. We characterized the microbial communities along two aquifer transects associated with thermally mobilized arsenic near Northeastern Alberta oil sands deposits. 16S rRNA amplicons and metagenomic sequencing data of biomass from filtered groundwater indicated major changes in the dominant taxa between wells, especially those currently experiencing elevated arsenic concentrations. Annotation of arsenic-related genes indicated that efflux pumps (arsB, acr3), intracellular reduction (arsC) and methylation (arsM) genes were widespread amongst community members but comparatively few organisms encoded genes for arsenic respiratory reductases (arrA) and oxidases (arxA, aioA). While this indicates that microbes have the capacity to exacerbate arsenic toxicity by increasing the relative concentration of As(III), some populations of iron oxidizing and sulfate reducing bacteria (including novel Gallionella and Thermodesulfovibrionia populations) show potential for indirect bioremediation through formation of insoluble iron/sulfide minerals which adsorb or coprecipitate arsenic. An unusually high proportional abundance of a single Paceibacteria population that lacked arsenic resistance genes was identified in one high-arsenic well, and we discuss hypotheses for its ability to persist. Overall, this study describes how aquifer microbial communities respond to thermal and arsenic plumes, and predicts potential contributions of microbes to arsenic biogeochemical cycling under this disturbance.",NA,biorxiv

To test this, we recently introduced a functional measure of network-level E/I ratio (fE/I). Here, we applied fE/I and other quantitative EEG measures to alpha oscillations from source-reconstructed data in the EU-AIMS compilation of 267 EEG recordings from children-adolescents and adults with ASD and 209 controls. We analyzed these quantitative measures alongside evaluating for qualitative EEG abnormalities ranging from slowing of activity to epileptiform patterns aiming to replicate the findings from the SPACE-BAMBI study (Bruining et al., 2020). EEG abnormalities were only identified in a few adults and could not be statistically assessed. ASD children-adolescents with EEG abnormalities exhibited lower relative alpha power and lower fE/I compared to children-adolescents without abnormalities; however, the EEG-abnormality scoring did not stratify the behavioral heterogeneity of ASD using clinical measures. Surprisingly, several controls presented with qualitative EEG abnormalities and showed a strikingly similar anatomical distribution of lower fE/I to the one observed in the ASD group, suggesting a shift towards inhibition-dominated network dynamics, in regions associated with altered sensory processing. The robustness of this association between EEG abnormalities and reduced fE/I was further supported by re-analysis of the SPACE-BAMBI study in source space. Stratification by the presence of EEG abnormalities and their associated effects on network activity may help understand neurodevelopmental physiological heterogeneity and the difficulties in implementing E/I targeting treatments in unselected cohorts.",NA,biorxiv

We specifically recorded from foveal superior colliculus (SC) neurons when a visual image only overlapped with their response fields (RFs) after foveating saccades but not pre-saccadically. When we rapidly changed the target features intra-saccadically, the foveal neurons post-saccadic visual reafferent responses were elevated, even though the neurons did not directly sample the pre-saccadic extrafoveal target features. This effect did not occur in the absence of saccades, and it also scaled with the extent of the introduced intra-saccadic image feature discrepancies. These results suggest that foveal SC neurons may signal a trans-saccadic prediction error when the foveated image stimulating them is inconsistent with that expected from pre-saccadic extrafoveal representations, a potential perceptual stability mechanism.",NA,biorxiv

Alternative genotyping methods such as RADseq and complementary data from near-infrared spectroscopy could help improve the cost-effectiveness of genomic selection. However, the impact of these factors and alternative approaches on predictive ability beyond experimental populations still need to be investigated. In this study, we evaluated 137 prediction scenarios varying the described factors and alternative approaches, offering recommendations for implementing genomic selection in apple breeding. Our results show that extending the training set with germplasm related to the predicted breeding material can improve average predictive ability across eleven studied traits by up to 0.08. The study emphasizes the usefulness of leave-one-family-out validation, reflecting the application of genomic selection to a new family, although it reduced average predictive ability across traits by up to 0.24 compared to cross-validation. Similar average predictive abilities across traits indicate that imputed RADseq data could be a suitable genotyping alternative to SNP array datasets. The best-performing scenario using near-infrared spectroscopy data for phenomic prediction showed a 0.35 decrease in average predictive ability across traits compared to conventional genomic prediction, suggesting that the tested phenomic selection approach is impractical.

The aged brain is rejuvenated by youth-associated plasma factors, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), which we have shown acts on the extracellular matrix (ECM) to regulate synaptic plasticity. Given emerging roles for microglia in these processes, we examined the impact of TIMP2 on microglial function. We show that TIMP2 deletion exacerbates microglial phenotypes associated with aging, including transcriptomic changes in cell activation, increased microgliosis, and increased levels of stress and inflammatory proteins measured in the brain extracellular space by in vivo microdialysis. Deleting specific cellular pools of TIMP2 in vivo increased microglial activation and altered myelin phagocytosis. Treating aged mice with TIMP2 reversed several phenotypes observed in our deletion models, resulting in decreased microglial activation, reduced proportions of proinflammatory microglia, and enhanced phagocytosis of physiological substrates. Our results identify TIMP2 as a key modulator of age-associated microglia dysfunction.

This  haplobank approach relies on knowledge of the HLA genotypes of the population to identify the most beneficial haplotypes for patient coverage, and ultimately identify donors or cord blood units carrying two copies of the target haplotype. A potentially more efficient alternative to a national bank approach is to assess the haplotypes required to provide global patient coverage and to produce a single, global haplobank. Toward that end, we have developed an algorithm to prioritize HLA haplotypes that optimize coverage across the global population.

We analyzed data from eighteen countries participating in the Global Alliance for iPS Therapy (GAiT). A representative pool of HLA genotypes, reflecting the HLA of patients, was derived by sampling from each countrys WMDA hematopoietic stem cell donor registry, or surrogate population. An algorithm was created based on HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 haplotype homozygous types with population HLA matching coverage defined by the absence of Host versus Graft (HvG) mismatches at these loci. HLA matching coverage was determined by iteratively selecting HLA haplotypes that provide the largest coverage against patient HLA genotypes sampled from the same population, excluding genotypes compatible with previous iterations. The top 10 haplotypes for each of the 18 countries were identified with patient coverage ranging from 19.5% in Brazil to 63.8% in Japan, with a mean coverage of 33.3%. In a  global model, utilizing the 180 most frequent haplotypes across all 18 populations (equivalent to 10 lines pe country), the patient coverage ranged from 54.6% in India to 81.7% in Sweden, with a mean of 68.4%. Our findings demonstrate that global collaboration could more than double the potential for patient HLA matching coverage.

Interrogation of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donor registry and cord blood bank HLA data demonstrated that HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 homozygous donors for the top 180 global haplotypes are widely available. These results show that a globally coordinated strategy for haplobanking would reduce redundancy and allow more patients to be treated with the same investment.

This study analysed the physiological and biochemical indexes of A. dahurica seedlings and soil enzyme activities under a series concentration of root, stem and leaf extracts from A. philoxeroides. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to detect the rhizosphere microorganism diversity of A. dahurica. Results showed that with the increase of extract concentration and the extension of treatment time, the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT) in seedlings increased and then decreased, and the inhibitory effect of root extract was the most significant. The extract effect on soil enzyme activity followed the descending sequence: root stem leaf. The activities of soil enzymes S-{beta}-GC, S-LAP and S-ALP showed an upward trend with the increase of extract concentration, and the highest enzyme activity was found at 80 g/L. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroides and Sphingomonas were the dominant species of rhizosphere soil bacteria under the treatment of each extract at phyla level.

An important cause of isoform-specific decay is the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, which degrades transcripts with premature termination codons (PTCs) and other features. Understanding NMD functions requires strategies to quantify isoform kinetics; however, current approaches remain limited. Methods like nucleotide-recoding RNA-seq (NR-seq) enable insights into RNA kinetics, but existing bioinformatic tools do not provide robust, isoform-specific degradation rate constant estimates. We extend the EZbakR-suite by implementing a strategy to infer isoform-level kinetics from short-read NR-seq data. This approach uncovers unexpected variability in NMD efficiency among transcripts with conserved PTC-containing exons and rapid decay of a subset of mRNAs lacking PTCs. Our findings highlight the effects of competition between NMD and other decay pathways, provide mechanistic insights into established NMD efficiency correlates, and identify transcript features promoting efficient decay.",NA,biorxiv

Despite advances in computational and experimental methods, identifying enhancers and their target genes essential for specific biological processes remains challenging. Determining target genes for enhancers is also complex and often relies on indirect, low-resolution, and/or assumptive methodologies. To identify and functionally perturb enhancers at their endogenous sites without altering their sequence, we performed a pooled tiling CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screen surrounding PHOX2B, a master regulator of neuronal cell fate and a key player in neuroblastoma development. This screen allowed the de novo identification of CRISPRa responsive elements (CaREs) that alter cellular growth within the 2 Mb genomic region. To determine CaRE target genes, we developed TESLA-seq (TargEted SingLe cell Activation), which combines CRISPRa screening with targeted single-cell RNA-sequencing and enables the parallel readout of the effect of hundreds of enhancers on all genes in the locus. While most TESLA-revealed CaRE-gene relationships involved neuroblastoma-related regulatory elements already active in the system, we found many CaREs and target connections normally active only in other tissue types or with no previous evidence and induced out of context by CRISPRa. This highlights the power of TESLA-seq to reveal gene regulatory networks, including edges active outside of a given experimental system.

To elucidate how the brain transforms visual inputs into neural representations of navigationally relevant information, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) responses to diverse indoor and outdoor scenes along with behavioral annotations of locomotive action affordances (e.g., walking, cycling), object annotations, and low-level image features to model distinct types of scene information. Using representational similarity analysis, we examined the neural representation of locomotive action affordances over time, their co-localization within scene-selective cortex, and their computational alignment with deep neural networks (DNNs). Our results show that locomotive action affordance representations emerge within 200 ms of visual processing, showing unique contributions to EEG responses at temporally distinct time-points from objects and low-level properties. Spatiotemporal fusion with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings in scene-selective brain regions reveals that both the parahippocampal (PPA) and occipital place region (OPA), but not the medial place region (MPA), contribute to locomotive action affordance representations, with a distinct temporal hierarchy between them. While DNNs exhibit good predictivity of early EEG responses, they primarily capture low-level features and show limited alignment with affordance processing.

Sample-wise assembly has become the standard due to its computational efficiency and strain-level resolution. It requires dereplication, the removal of near-identical genomes assembled in different metagenomic samples. We present MAGmax, an efficient dereplication tool that enhances both the quantity and quality of MAGs through a strategy of bin merging and re-assembly. Unlike dRep, which selects a single representative bin per genome cluster, MAGmax merges multiple bins within a cluster and reassembles them to increase coverage. MAGmax produces more dereplicated, higher-quality MAGs than dRep at 1.6x its speed and using three times less memory.

While the molecular mechanisms underlying vertebrate and insect immune responses have been studied extensively, those of aquatic invertebrates remain unexplored, despite their critical role in ecosystem stability and aquaculture. Here, we use the Daphnia magna-Pasteuria ramosa system to investigate the hosts immune response and the molecular mechanisms underlying host-parasite interactions. We inoculated 800 D. magna hosts with 20,000 mature spores of P. ramosa and tracked the progression of infection by measuring the proportion of infected individuals and the developmental stages of the parasite at multiple time points post-inoculation (hereafter p.i.). RNA sequencing was performed at key infection phases, early (Cauliflower stage), mid (Cauliflower and Grape stages), and terminal (Cauliflower, Grape, and Mature spore stages), to capture gene expression changes linked to infection dynamics. Our transcriptomic analyses revealed key immune genes involved in host defense, including genes involved in Toll signaling pathways, thereby revealing significant changes in pathways related to immune function, host metabolism, and resource allocation. Our findings suggest that iron sequestration may serve as a host defense strategy to restrict parasite growth, representing a form of nutritional immunity. Furthermore, pathways associated with infection-induced phenotypic traits, such as somatic growth, red coloration, and castration, were significantly upregulated, underscoring the impact of the infection on host physiology. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into the interplay between hosts and parasites at a molecular level in an ecologically relevant system, advancing our understanding of infection strategies in aquatic invertebrates.",NA,biorxiv

In Drosophila melanogaster, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) together with intestinal cell renewal play a key role in eliminating gut microbes. A complementary mechanism would be to isolate and treat pathogenic bacteria while allowing colonization by commensals. Using real-time imaging to follow the fate of ingested bacteria, we demonstrate that while commensal Lactiplantibacillus plantarum freely circulate within the intestinal lumen, pathogenic strains such as Erwinia carotovora or Bacillus thuringiensis, are blocked in the anterior midgut where they are rapidly eliminated by antimicrobial peptides. This sequestration of pathogenic bacteria in the anterior midgut requires the Duox enzyme in enterocytes, and both TrpA1 and Dh31 in enteroendocrine cells. Supplementing larval food with hCGRP, the human homolog of Dh31, is sufficient to block the bacteria, suggesting the existence of a conserved mechanism. While the IMD pathway is essential for eliminating the trapped bacteria, it is dispensable for the blockage. Genetic manipulations impairing bacterial compartmentalization result in abnormal colonization of posterior midgut regions by pathogenic bacteria. Despite a functional IMD pathway, this ectopic colonization leads to bacterial proliferation and larval death, demonstrating the critical role of bacteria anterior sequestration in larval defense. Our study reveals a temporal orchestration during which pathogenic bacteria, but not innocuous, are confined in the anterior part of the midgut in which they are eliminated in an IMD pathway dependent manner.

AUTHOR SUMMARYTypically, when considering the immune response of animals to infection, we focus on classical immunity, encompassing both innate and adaptive aspects such as antimicrobials and circulating immune cells. However, a broader perspective on immunity includes additional strategies that enhance host protection, such as behavioral avoidance and internal mechanisms that restrict pathogen propagation. In our study using Drosophila larvae as a model, we uncovered spatially and temporally interconnected events that are crucial for effectively combating intestinal infections. Our findings reveal a two-step defense mechanism: first, the larvae rapidly discriminate between bacterial strains, effectively confining hazardous ones in the anterior section of the intestine. These blocked bacteria trigger the synthesis and release of antimicrobial peptides by the host, which ultimately eradicate the entrapped pathogens. Our experiments show that larvae capable of both limiting bacteria spreading and producing antimicrobial peptides withstand infections. In contrast, the absence of either one of these sequential defenses results in high mortality among the larvae, emphasizing the importance of each step and the necessity of their precise coordination in the immune response.",NA,biorxiv

Here, we describe the use of microbeads as a focus aid for long-term live cell imaging to address these autofocus issues. This protocol is inexpensive to implement, without extensive additional sample preparation and can be used to capture focused images of transparent cells in a label-free manner. To validate this protocol, a widefield inverted microscope was used with software-based autofocus to image overnight in time-lapse format, demonstrating the use of the beads to prevent focal drift in long-term experiments. This improves autofocus accuracy on relatively inexpensive microscopes without using hardware-based focus aids.

While oscillations or waves in key developmental pathways, such as Wnt, have been widely observed, the principles governing how cells decode these signals remain unclear. By leveraging optogenetic control of the Wnt signaling pathway in both HEK293T cells and H9 human embryonic stem cells, we systematically map the relationship between signal frequency and downstream pathway activation. We find that cells exhibit a minimal response to Wnt at certain frequencies, a behavior we term anti-resonance. We developed both detailed biochemical and simplified hidden variable models that explain how anti-resonance emerges from the interplay between fast and slow pathway dynamics. Remarkably, we find that frequency directly influences cell fate decisions involved in human gastrulation; signals delivered at anti-resonant frequencies result in dramatically reduced mesoderm differentiation. Our work reveals a previously unknown mechanism of how cells decode dynamic signals and how anti-resonance may filter against spurious activation. These findings establish new insights into how cells decode dynamic signals with implications for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and cancer biology.

Significance StatementWnt signaling is responsible for driving stem cell differentiation. Our study explores a wide range of temporal patterns of Wnt activation using state-of-the-art optogenetics, advanced imaging and modeling.

We confirm this anti-resonant suppression for two human cell lines, HEK and embryonic stem cells, and expect that it also occurs in other pathways, as it arises from the interplay of different timescales along the pathway.

While there have been many advancements in determining the structures of protein-metal complexes, numerous metal-binding proteins still need to be identified through computational methods and validated through experiments. To address this need, we have developed the ESMBind workflow, which combines evolutionary scale modeling (ESM) for metal-binding prediction and physics-based protein-metal modeling. Our approach utilizes the ESM-2 and ESM-IF models to predict metal-binding probability at the residue level. In addition, we have designed a metal-placement method and energy minimization technique to generate detailed 3D structures of protein-metal complexes. Our workflow outperforms other models in terms of residue and 3D-level predictions.

The ASC-1 complex splits stalled ribosomes into 40S subunits and nascent chain-tRNA-associated 60S subunits (60S RNCs). 60S RNCs associate with NEMF that promotes recruitment of the RING-type E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase Listerin (Ltn1 in yeast), which ubiquitinates nascent chains. RING-type E3s mediate the transfer of Ub directly from the E2[~]Ub conjugate, implying that the specificity of Ub linkage is determined by the given E2. Listerin is most efficient when it is paired with promiscuous Ube2D E2s. We previously found that TCF25 (Rqc1 in yeast) can impose K48- specificity on Listerin paired with Ube2D E2s. To determine the mechanism of TCF25s action, we combined functional biochemical studies and AlphaFold3 modeling and now report that TCF25 specifically interacts with the RING domain of Listerin and the acceptor ubiquitin (UbA) and imposes K48-specificity by orienting UbA such that its K48 is directly positioned to attack the thioester bond of the Ube2D1[~]Ub conjugate.

The precise pathophysiological mechanism(s) underling this association remains an active topic of research. We propose that maternal immune activation (MIA) triggered by IAV infection can disrupt selective permeability at the maternal-fetal interface, leading to increased transfer of blood-derived molecules into the fetal compartment. Some of these molecules might be responsible for the initiation of inflammatory cascades implicated in NDD etiology. Using a murine model of seasonal IAV infection during pregnancy, we examined placental and fetal brain barrier properties following maternal IAV challenge. Our findings demonstrate an enhanced transplacental transfer of fluorescently labeled tracers from maternal circulation to key neurodevelopmental regions, including the subventricular zone (SVZ) and choroid plexus (ChP) of fetal brains. This effect was most pronounced in fetuses from dams exposed to the highest dose of IAV. Notably, a similar pattern was observed for accumulation of the bloodborne neuroinflammatory molecule fibrinogen in these same brain regions, which was further amplified in response to the highest IAV dose. Moreover, fibrinogen accumulation was positively correlated with Iba1+ cell immunofluorescence, suggesting a potential interaction between fibrinogen and Iba1+ cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that IAV-induced MIA enhances transplacental transfer of blood-derived molecules into fetal tissues, potentially activating proinflammatory pathways in Iba1+ cells.

However, their full genomic spectrum has not yet been fully elucidated. This study comprehensively characterised the expression of signature junctions of these nt-RNA (termed 'toxic junctions' here) of both known and novel nt-RNA across multiple cancer types and investigated their potential as biomarkers. Methods: RNA-seq data of ~6,000 samples, including the tumor and normal samples for 13 cancer types were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) together with data from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project. Due to the difficulty in quantifying the entire transcript isoform of nt-RNA, we pioneered an algorithm to focus exclusively on the expression of junctional reads, which also circumvented the limitation of non-directional RNA-seq of TCGA data. We showed that the majority of nt-RNA is associated with at least one toxic junction. We built a comprehensive catalogue of known nt-RNA toxic junctions from genome databases. And novel toxic junctions were also identified by a new junction-focused algorithm from the higher quality discovery subsets of TCGA data. Splicing in Ratio (SiR) was used to quantify ASE leading to nt-RNA, enabling: 1. Differential expression analysis between cancer and normal tissue and across cancer types.2. Identification of different profiles of nt-RNA abundance and various factor which may be the causes of differential nt-RNA abundance and SiR results 3. Identification of specific nt-RNA and toxic junctions that were expressed in various cancer (and/or normal tissue) types. 4. Assessment of nt-RNA and their toxic junction expression as biomarkers or prognosis indicators. Results: We profiled the expressed known nt-RNA (toxic) junctions of known transcripts and discovered ~22,000 novel toxic junctions out of ~250,000 novel junctions found in the transcriptome data. The expression of nt-RNA was as high as 10% of all transcripts of the corresponding gene in cancer transcriptomes. Interestingly, some signature toxic junctions of nt-RNA are expressed in even higher quantities, e.g. up to 50% or more, which is reminiscent of a heterozygous mutation. We identified distinct patterns between cancer and normal samples, including example of nt-RNA expressing toxic junctions exclusively in normal or tumor samples. Clinically relevant examples included ANXA6 in breast cancer, where the nt-RNA isoform showed significantly higher expression in tumors (p=1.8e-15). In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), a significant isoform switch of ESYT2 based on the RNA-seq data was confirmed. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that samples with the higher expression ratio of ESYT2-L are associated with better survival (p=2.0e-06). Unsupervised clustering showed that SiR results of 150 toxic signatures defined 4 subgroups of patients with different prognosis. Through principal component analysis (PCA), PC1 and PC2 can be used as an independent prognosis biomarkers. nt-RNA accounting for these PCs included splicing factors SRSF3 and CLK1, where CLK1 phosphorylates SRSF3 to promote exon 4 inclusion in both genes. Conclusions: In summary, the expression profiles of all known and novel toxic junctions were explored using pan-cancer RNA-seq data. A dual 10% rule emerged from this study: ~10% of novel junctions were toxic junctions associated with nt-RNA, and up to 10% of RNA transcripts inside a cell were also nt-RNA. The SiR metric enables accurate quantification of unproductive splicing and identification of cancer biomarkers. Our findings reveal that unproductive splicing represents functionally important post-transcriptional regulation in cancer. These expression profiles allow researchers to study the expression of nt-RNA signature junctions or novel signature junctions in or near the genes they are interested in, which could provide a new direction for their research. The SRSF3-CLK1 regulatory mechanism provides insights into splicing dysregulation. Our comprehensive toxic junction catalogue serves as a valuable resource, suggesting that targeting unproductive splicing pathways may offer novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

In contrast with this view, here we show that cells exposed to micropatterned fibronectin gradients exhibit a complex repertoire of trajectories, including directed haptotactic migration up the gradient but also linear oscillations and circles with extended periods of migration down the gradient. To explain this behavior, we developed a biophysical model of haptotactic cell migration based on a coarse-grained molecular clutch model coupled to persistent stochastic polarity dynamics. While initial haptotactic migration is explained by the differential friction at the front and back of the cell, the observed complex trajectories over longer time scales arise from the interplay between differential friction, persistence, and physical confinement. Overall, our study reveals that confinement and persistence modulate the ability of cells to sense and respond to haptotactic cues and provides a framework to understand how cells navigate complex environments.",NA,biorxiv

Striated muscle cells contain a specialized membrane system known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that controls calcium homeoastasis and contraction, however the biochemical and physiological relationship between the ER and SR and how both compartments participate in protein synthesis remains incompletely understood.

MethodsProtein quantification and imaging of selected marker proteins for ER and SR functions was performed to characterize the relationship of the ER and SR and its individual involvement in protein synthesis in neonatal and adult cardiac myocytes. Superresolution microscopy was used to examine the interaction of ribosomes and the SR in adult cardiac myocytes.

ResultsQuantification of ER and SR-associated proteins of isolated ventricular cardiac myocytes showed that relative expression of ER/SR resident protein quality elements, as well as relative ribosome levels are decreased in adult cells, whereas SR-associated Ca2+ handling proteins increase. Immunocytoflourescence revealed that the membrane compartment that exists in early postpartum resembles mostly the ER and decreases in postnatal development. The SR is the main membrane network that exists in the adult cardiac myocytes, replacing the ER, in all but the perinuclear region. Immunocytoflourescence staining further indicated that both networks perform overlapping but distinct, specialized functions, such as localization of excitation-contraction coupling exclusively to the SR or initiation of secretion via the classical secretory pathway mainly from the ER. Ribosomes and mRNA were localized both in close proximity to the ER and the SR of adult ventricular cardiac myocytes. Superresolution microscopy confirmed that both the ER as well as the developed SR bind ribosomes and are direct sites of protein synthesis and protein homeostasis in adult cardiac myocytes.

ConclusionOur findings suggest molecular differentiation and structural organization of the ER/SR in cardiac muscle development, resulting in the development of a protein synthesis network at the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum in adult cardiac myocytes.",NA,biorxiv

While reaction-diffusion and patch-based models with simple flux assumptions for emigration have played a predominant role in modeling mosquito dispersal, mosquito behavioral ecology - in particular, the process of searching for resources - is usually ignored by diffusion-based models. We thus set out to analyze mosquito movement using highly mimetic models, to see what we could learn from a different approach. Here, we explore mosquito dispersal in behavioral state microsimulation models, in which mosquitoes are in behavioral states and search for the required resources that are distributed on a landscape. Models of this sort are laborious and challenging to work with, so we developed ramp.micro, an R package to build, solve, analyze, and visualize behavioral state microsimulation models for mosquitoes. We show that even when resources are distributed randomly and uniformly, mosquito populations tend to form highly spatially structured communities. We also show that some heterogeneity in mosquito population densities is attributed to features of a network defined by searching and the spatial distribution of resources. These models highlight the importance of understanding mosquito behaviors and resource availability as factors structuring mosquito population movement. Motivated by these dynamics, spatial models for mosquito ecology and mosquito-borne pathogen transmission would benefit from considering resource availability as a factor affecting mosquito movement and dispersal.

Author summaryWe develop highly realistic population dynamic models for mosquito behavioral ecology where mosquitoes move around on landscapes made up of resource point sets. The mosquitoes are in behavioral states - blood feeding, egg laying, or sugar feeding - and they end each search at a point where the resource they need can be found. Even with simple resource landscapes, mosquito populations are highly structured. Because mosquitoes tend to leave areas that lack a resource, and they tend to stay in areas that have all required resources, the scarcest resources end up determining the structure of mosquito populations.",NA,biorxiv

CBSV VPg interacts with all five cassava eIF4E-family members. Simultaneously knocking out eIF4E-family genes nCBP-1 and nCBP-2, in cultivar 60444, strongly reduces CBSD root symptoms and viral titer but does not result in complete resistance, likely due to gene family redundancy. To test for redundancy, we generated single and double mutants for each clade of the eIF4E gene family in farmer preferred cultivar TME419. Double mutants for the eIF(iso)4E and nCBP clades both exhibited reduced symptom severity, with ncbp-1 ncbp-2 having the strongest phenotype.

One major control point of this process is the Golgi apparatus, whose dysfunction causes numerous connective tissue disorders. Golgi function is tightly linked to its structure, which is maintained by the cytoskeleton and Golgi organising proteins. We sought to investigate the role of two of these organising proteins, the golgins GMAP210 and Golgin-160, in ECM secretion. We found that loss of either protein had distinct impacts on Golgi organisation. GMAP210 loss caused cisternal fragmentation and dilation, alongside the accumulation of tubulovesicular structures. Meanwhile, Golgin-160 knockout lead to Golgi fragmentation and vesicle build-up. Nonetheless, loss of each protein had a similar impact on ECM secretion and glycosaminoglycan synthesis. We therefore propose that golgins are collectively required to create the correct physical-chemical space to support efficient ECM protein secretion and modification. This is the first time that Golgin-160 has been shown to be required for ECM secretion.

The study aimed at deriving equations that can be fitted to both theoretically and empirically derived data for the quantitation of other thermodynamic parameters and its cognate dimensionless equilibrium constant; some of the derived equations addressed the issue of viscosity and the concentration of cholesterol in particular as they affect translational velocity needed for the delivery of biomolecules to the site of need. The instantaneous velocities before terminal velocity are: [~] 0.046674 m/s (cytosol); 0.141837 m/s (water). The terminal velocities were approximately equal to 3.548614 nm/s for the cytosol and 99.590626 nm/s for the water; these values were computed using literature values of translational diffusion coefficients (Di) of glucose in cytoplasm and in water. The value in water is higher than in the cytosol because of higher cytosolic viscosity than aqueous viscosity. These support the view that cholesterol and viscosity have a dual-edged effect on the pathophysiologic state orchestrated by SARS-CoV-2; higher viscosities in the membrane and in the cytoplasm enhance binding and infection and can diminish the progress of infection, respectively. Higher feasibility and rates were observed at lower thermodynamic temperatures than at higher ones, according to the outcome of the analysis of the viral binding free energy and activation energy, respectively. The dimensionless constant values were higher at the earlier time of the infection and decreased with time, exhibiting a power law relationship. It is advised, among others, that pharmaceuticals (including airborne surfactants) and drugs in solution be given at temperatures above body temperature. Swab testing should be performed on a regular basis to detect significant infections early. Future in vitro and in vivo studies on viral infection might focus on various time periods at different temperatures, above and below body temperature.

However, the precise composition of these structures remains largely unknown, although it is key to unravelling colour production mechanisms and morphogenesis. The longhorn beetle Doliops similis displays vibrant green patterns on its otherwise dark elytra. These patterns are formed by arrays of minute scales that encompass a three-dimensional photonic crystal made of orderly packed nanospheres. We found that these nanospheres are composed of carbonated amorphous calcium phosphate biomineral. By accurately parameterizing the structure and calculating the refractive index deduced from the relative fractions of the organic and inorganic phases, we derived reflection wavelengths that match the observed green hue, demonstrating the biominerals role in colour production. Our study further reveals that biomineralization is widespread in the Lamiinae subfamily, with colour diversity achieved through variations in nanosphere size, packing, and composition. This study opens new avenues for developing bioinspired mineral-based optical devices with high refractive indices and defect-resistance, overcoming the shortcomings of current polymer-based designs.",NA,biorxiv

A critical area of cancer research is organizing patient cohorts into subtypes and associating subtypes with clinical and biological outcomes for more effective prognosis and treatment. Large-scale studies have collected a plethora of omics data across multiple tumor types. These studies provide an extensive dataset for stratifying patient cohorts. Network-based stratification (NBS) approaches have been presented to classify cancer tumors using somatic mutation data. A challenge in cancer stratification is integrating omics data to yield clinically meaningful subtypes. In this study, we integrate somatic mutation data with RNA sequencing data within the NBS framework and investigate the effectiveness of integrated NBS on three cancers: ovarian, bladder, and uterine cancer. We show that integrated NBS subtypes are more significantly associated with overall survival or histology. Integrated NBS networks also reveal highly influential genes that drive cancer initiation and progression. This comprehensive approach underscores the significance of integrating genomic data types in cancer subtyping, offering profound implications for personalized prognosis and treatment strategies.",NA,biorxiv

Whereas some iflaviruses cause severe diseases in insects, numerous iflaviruses that were detected in healthy populations of butterflies and moths (order: Lepidoptera) do not show apparent symptoms. Compared to other hosts, only few iflavirus genomes for lepidopteran hosts could be found in publicly available databases and we know little about the occurrence of iflaviruses in natural and laboratory lepidopteran populations. To expand the known diversity of iflaviruses in Lepidoptera, we developed a pipeline to automatically reconstruct virus genomes from public transcriptome data. We reconstructed 1,548 virus genomes from 55 different lepidopteran species that we were identified as coding-complete based on their length. To include incompletely assembled genomes, we developed a reference-based patching approach, resulting in 240 patched genomes. By including publicly available genomes, we inferred a phylogeny consisting of 139 non-redundant iflavirus genomes. Of these, 65 represent novel complete genomes, of which 39 might even belong to novel virus species. Our analysis expanded virus host range, where highly similar viruses were found in the transcriptomes of different lepidopteran species, genera or even families. Additionally, we find two groups of lepidopteran species depending on the diversity of viruses that infect them: some species were only infected by closely related viruses, whereas other species are infected by highly diverse viruses from different regions of the phylogeny. Finally, we show that the evolution of one virus species, Iflavirus betaspexiguae, is impacted by recombination within the species, which is also supported by the co-occurrence of multiple strains within data sets. Our analysis demonstrates how data mining of publicly available sequencing data can be used at a large scale to reconstruct intra-family viral diversity which serves as a basis to study virus host range and evolution. Our results contain numerous novel viruses and novel virus-host associations, including viruses for relevant insect pests, highlighting the impact of iflaviruses in insect ecology and as potential biological control agents in the future.",NA,biorxiv

Hearing loss is a key early marker of such decline and is linked to numerous comorbidities in older adults. Yet, [~]10% of middle-aged individuals who report hearing difficulties show normal audiograms. Cochlear neural degeneration (CND) could contribute to these hidden hearing deficits, though its role remains unclear due to a lack of objective diagnostics and uncertainty regarding its perceptual outcomes. Here, we employed a cross-species design to examine neural and behavioral signatures of CND. We measured envelope following responses (EFRs) - neural ensemble responses to sound originating from the peripheral auditory pathway - in young and middle-aged adults with normal audiograms and compared these responses to young and middle-aged Mongolian gerbils, where CND was histologically confirmed. We observed near identical changes in EFRs across species that were associated with CND. Behavioral assessments revealed agerelated speech-in-noise deficits under challenging conditions, while pupil-indexed listening effort increased with age even when behavioral performance was matched. Together, these results demonstrate that CND contributes to speech perception difficulties and elevated listening effort in midlife, which may ultimately lead to listening fatigue and social withdrawal.",NA,biorxiv

However, their populations are in decline due to habitat degradation and unsustainable agriculture. This study assesses the effectiveness of color traps for bee monitoring in two distinct yet geographically close habitats in ""Jenaer Forst"" natural reserve in Germany. Over a 23-week period in spring and summer 2023, we tested six trap colors (blue, yellow, white, violet, blue-yellow, and violet-white) and analyzed their performance in terms of bee abundance, diversity, and species composition. Our results indicate that violet and blue-yellow traps captured the highest bee abundance and species richness. While overall bee community composition did not differ significantly between trap colors, specific species showed color preferences. The blue-yellow trap emerged as a versatile option, potentially capturing a diverse range of species through its contrasting colors. Moreover, despite the close proximity of the two sites, differences in community composition suggest that habitat-specific factors influence bee color preferences. Minor habitat changes significantly impacted trap effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of tailored trap designs. These findings highlight the importance of considering both color contrast and habitat context when designing bee monitoring strategies and understanding bee foraging behavior. This study contributes valuable insights to improve trap designs and enhance our understanding of the interactions between bees and their environments.",NA,biorxiv

We show that HYZ selectively targets 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO) by chelating its metal cofactor and alkylating one of its ligands. This covalent inactivation slows entry of proteins into the Cys/N-degron pathway that ADO initiates. HYZs capacity to stabilize regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS4/5) normally marked for degradation by ADO explains its effect on blood vessel tension and comports with prior associations of insufficient RGS levels with human preeclampsia and analogous symptoms in mice.

Yet the impact of using contact tracing, a type of non-uniform sampling used in public health applications such as infectious disease outbreak investigations, has not been investigated in the molecular epidemiology field. To understand how contact tracing influences a recovered phylogeny, we developed a new simulation tool called SEEPS (Sequence Evolution and Epidemiological Process Simulator) that allows for the simulation of contact tracing and the resulting transmission tree, pathogen phylogeny, and corresponding virus genetic sequences. Importantly, SEEPS takes within-host evolution into account when generating pathogen phylogenies and sequences from transmission histories. Using SEEPS, we demonstrate that contact tracing can significantly impact the structure of the resulting tree, as described by popular tree statistics. Contact tracing generates phylogenies that are less balanced than the underlying transmission process, less representative of the larger epidemiological process, and affects the internal/external branch length ratios that characterize specific epidemiological scenarios. We also examined real data from a 2007-2008 Swedish HIV-1 outbreak and the broader 1998-2010 European HIV-1 epidemic to highlight the differences in contact tracing and expected phylogenies. Aided by SEEPS, we show that the data collection of the Swedish outbreak was strongly influenced by contact tracing even after downsampling, while the broader European Union epidemic showed little evidence of universal contact tracing, agreeing with the known epidemiological information about sampling and spread. Overall, our results highlight the importance of including possible non-uniform sampling schemes when examining phylogenetic trees. For that, SEEPS serves as a useful tool to evaluate such impacts, thereby facilitating better phylogenetic inferences of the characteristics of a disease outbreak.

We find that females that were more socially integrated with other females in the year before giving birth had higher offspring survival to age 1 (the period of highest mortality) and age 5 (the approximate age of weaning). Furthermore, social integration remained a strong predictor of offspring survival among females without close female kin.

While viromics has expanded genomic catalogs, host identification for these viruses remains challenging due to the limitations in scaling cultivation-based approaches and the uncertain reliability and relative low resolution of in silico predictions - particularly for understudied viral taxa. Towards this, Hi-C proximity ligation uses sequenced, cross-linked virus and host genomic fragments to infer virus-host linkages and has now been applied in at least nine studies. However, its accuracy remains unknown. Here we assess Hi-C performance in recovering virus-host interactions using synthetic communities (SynComs) composed of four bacterial strains and nine phages with known interactions and then apply optimized protocols to natural soil samples. In SynComs, standard Hi-C sample preparations and analyses showed poor normalized linkage score performance (26% specificity, 100% sensitivity, incorrect matches up to class level) that could be dramatically improved by Z-score filtering (Z [&ge;] 0.5, 99% specificity), though at reduced sensitivity (62% down from 100%). Detection limits were established as reproducibility was poor below minimal phage abundances of 105 PFU/mL. Applying optimized protocols to natural soil samples, we compared Hi-C inferred virus-linkages with in silico bioinformatic predictions. Prior to Z-score thresholding, agreement was relatively high at the phylum to family levels (72%), but not at the genus (43%) or species (15%) levels. Z-score thresholding reduced sensitivity (only 34% of predictions were retained), with only modest improvements in congruence with bioinformatic methods (48% or 18% at genus or species levels, respectively). Regardless, this led to 79 genus-level-congruent virus-host linkages and 293 new ones revealed by Hi-C alone - i.e., providing many new virus-host interactions to explore in already well-studied climate-critical soils. Overall, these findings provide empirical benchmarks and methodological guidelines to improve the accuracy and reliability of Hi-C for virus-host linkage studies in complex microbial communities.",NA,biorxiv

We assessed and compared Aedes aegypti population dynamics and dengue (DEN) and yellow fever (YF) epidemic risks among peri-urban and intra-urban villages during the 2023-2024 DEN outbreaks in Cocody-Bingerville, southern Cote dIvoire.

MethodsFrom August 2023 to July 2024, we sampled Aedes eggs, larvae and pupae in the domestic and peridomestic ecozones of three peri-urban and three intra-urban villages. We compared Ae. aegypti larval infestation, container productivity, Stegomyia indices (house index: HI, container index: CI, and Breteau index: BI) and pupal indices (pupae per house index: PHI, pupae per container index: PCI, and pupae per person index: PPI) between the study villages.

ResultsAedes aegypti widely dominated Aedes fauna in both peri-urban (98.1%) and intra-urban (99.8%) villages. Immatures were sampled from seven container types. However, the most productive containers were small containers, tires and medium containers which produced 81.8% of all the pupae in the peri-urban villages, and tires and small containers yielding 83.2% in the intra-urban villages. These key containers produced substantially more pupae in the domestic ecozones (70.9%) in the peri-urban villages, but equitably between the domestic (48.8%) and peridomestic (51.2%) ecozones in the intra-urban villages. In each study village, they yielded around 90% and 80% of pupae during the short dry and long rainy seasons, respectively. CI, HI and BI were comparable between the peri-urban (29.9%, 35.9% and 41.4) and intra-urban (36.7%, 48.0% and 56.2) villages, and surpassed the World Health Organization (WHO) DEN and YF epidemic thresholds. PCI (1.26 vs. 3.38 pupae/container) and PHI (1.75 vs. 5.18 pupae/house) were lower in the peri-urban than in the intra-urban villages, while PPI (0.54 vs. 1.25 pupae/person) was similar between the villages. Unlike temperature and relative humidity, all indices were strongly associated with rainfall in all the study villages.

ConclusionIn Cocody-Bingerville, all sampled peri-urban and intra-urban villages exhibited high densities of Ae. aegypti immatures and habitats. Although larval habitats were diverse, a limited number of container types accounted for over 80% of pupal production. Stegomyia indices remained consistently elevated, exceeding WHO epidemic thresholds for DEN and YF across all study villages, potentially contributing to ongoing DEN outbreaks. Therefore, vector surveillance and outbreak responses should be extended to peri-urban villages, as they could act as arbovirus re-introduction sources. Community-based interventions targeting the identified key containers could help control the outbreaks. This study provides a baseline for strategically reducing human exposure to arboviruses in the study villages.",NA,biorxiv

The RVFV genome consists of three single-stranded, negative-sense RNA segments differing in size: Small (S), Medium (M) and Large (L). Segment S encodes the virus nucleoprotein N and the virulence-associated factor non-structural (NSs) protein in opposite orientations, separated by an intergenic region (IGR). To overcome the current need of using secondary techniques to detect the presence of RVFV in infected cells, we used T7-driven polymerase plasmid-based reverse genetics to generate replication-competent recombinant (r)RVFV expressing Nanoluciferase (Nluc) or Venus fluorescent proteins. These reporter genes were used as valid surrogates to track the presence of RVFV in mammalian and insect cells. Notably, we explored the genome plasticity of RVFV and compared four different strategies by modifying the viral segment S in order to introduce the reporter gene foreign sequences. The reporter-expressing rRVFV were stable and able to replicate in cultured mammalian and insect cells, although to a lesser extent than the recombinant wild-type (WT) counterpart. Moreover, rRVFV expressing reporter genes were validated to identify neutralizing antibodies or compounds with antiviral activity. In vivo, all mice infected with the reporter-expressing rRVFV displayed an attenuated phenotype, although at different levels. These rRVFV expressing reporter genes provide a novel approach to better understand the biology and pathogenesis of RVFV, and represent an excellent biotechnological tool for developing new therapeutics against RVFV infections.

Vocal cord injection is a commonly utilized therapeutic approach to rectify this gap by augmenting vocal cord volume; however, the optimal injectable material remains undetermined. Dedifferentiated fat cells (DFATs), derived from mature adipocytes, exhibit robust proliferative capacity and multipotency, establishing them as potential candidates for treating glottic insufficiency. This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of DFATs in a rat model of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. In the experimental design, the recurrent laryngeal nerve of each rat was resected unilaterally, and 5 weeks later, the atrophied vocal cord muscles were injected with either 10 l of saline (control), 1.0 x 106 DFATs in 10 l (DFAT group), or 1.0 x 106 DFATs combined with 500 ng of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in 10 l (DFAT + bFGF group). At 4 weeks post-injection, laryngeal endoscopy was performed to evaluate the glottic gap, followed by histological analyses to assess vocal muscle atrophy, collagen deposition, and markers of cellular proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (TUNEL). To confirm DFAT engraftment, GFP-labeled DFATs were evaluated at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-injection. Results indicated that both the DFAT and DFAT + bFGF groups exhibited significantly reduced glottic gaps, increased collagen deposition, and decreased TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells compared to controls. Notably, the DFAT + bFGF group displayed superior outcomes, including a greater vocal muscle area and enhanced Ki-67-positive cell proliferation, indicating mitigation of muscle atrophy. GFP-positive DFATs were detectable in the tissue for up to 6 weeks, confirming engraftment. These findings underscore the potential of DFATs, particularly in combination with bFGF, as an innovative and effective therapeutic approach for glottic insufficiency secondary to recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis.",NA,biorxiv

Here, using patient brain tissues and genome-edited mice, we identified glial progenitor cells (GPCs), including oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), as the glioma-originating cell type harboring the IDH mutation as the initial driver mutation. We conducted comprehensive deep sequencing, including droplet digital PCR and deep panel and amplicon sequencing to 128 tissues from 62 patients (29 IDH-mutant gliomas and 33 IDH-negative controls) comprising tumors, normal cortex or normal subventricular zone (SVZ), and blood. Surprisingly, low-level IDH mutation was found in the normal cortex away from the tumor in 38.5% (10 of 26) of IDH-mutant glioma patients, whereas no IDH mutation was detected in the normal SVZ. Furthermore, by analyzing cell-type-specific mutations, the direction of clonal evolution, the single-cell transcriptome from patient brains and novel mouse model of IDH-mutant glioma arising from mutation-carrying OPCs, we determined that GPCs, including OPCs, harboring the initial driver mutation are responsible for the development and evolution of IDH-mutant gliomas.

Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy can prevent marrow failure and lower leukemia risk, but mucosal gene therapy to lower HNSCC risk remains untested. Major knowledge gaps include an incomplete understanding of how rapidly gene-corrected cellular lineages could spread through the oral epithelium, and which delivery parameters are critical for ensuring efficient gene correction. To answer these questions, we extended an agent-based model of the oral epithelium to include the delivery of gene correction in situ to FA cells and the competitive dynamics between cellular lineages with and without gene correction. We found that only gene-corrected lineages with substantial proliferative advantages (probability of resisting displacement out of the basal layer [&ge;] 0. 1) could spread on clinically relevant timelines, and that these lineages were initially at high risk of loss in the generations following correction. Delivering gene correction to many cells minimizes the risk of loss, while delivery to many distinct locations within a tissue maximizes the rate of spread. To determine the impact of mucosal gene therapy in preventing the clonal expansion of pre-cancerous mutations, we compared the expected burden of TP53 mutations in simulated tissue sections with and without gene correction. We found that when FA cells have elevated genome instability or a TP53-dependent proliferative advantage, gene correction can substantially reduce the accumulation of pro-tumorigenic mutations. This model illustrates the power of computational frameworks to identify critical determinants of therapeutic success to enable experimental optimization and support novel and effective gene therapy applications.

Author summaryWe investigated factors influencing the success of oral mucosal gene therapy for Fanconi Anemia (FA), a genetic syndrome marked by DNA repair defects in conjunction with a heightened risk of cancer. We used a computational model of the oral epithelium to determine how gene therapy corrected cells compete with FA background cells and the best gene delivery approaches to promote effective tissue replacement by gene-corrected cells. We find that gene-corrected cells require strong proliferative advantages to spread effectively, and that initially delivering gene correction to more cells reduces the chance that these cells are stochastically eliminated before they can spread. We also demonstrate that gene correction reduces the accumulation of pro-tumorigenic TP53 mutations in an FA context, where genomic instability can elevate the mutation rate and FA-specific selective pressures could favor accelerated TP53 clonal expansion. This research provides a useful framework for guiding mucosal gene therapy experiments and the development of effective oral gene therapy protocols for cancer prevention in FA.",NA,biorxiv

Their detection represents a significant challenge due to their diversity, size, and enrichment in repetitive regions. With the use of high quality long-read technologies, the majority of these challenges can now be mitigated. However, many downstream applications ranging from clinical diagnostics and genome-wide association studies to large-scale aggregation of population variants continue to rely on short-read-sequencing data due to its high through-put and cost-effectiveness. Thus, the challenges of short-read sequencing SV detection remain a constant and relevant obstacle. We created dicast, a machine-learning method to improve the identification of true-positive SVs from short-read sequencing using genomic context and alignment features. Dicast is driven by a novel and comprehensive benchmark call-set created through the combination of several sequencing technologies and rigorous manual curation. This benchmark set served as the basis for a systematic evaluation of five sequencing platforms and fifteen SV detection methods across different SV classes, sizes, and genomic contexts, enabling us to quantify the strengths and weaknesses of each and inform the training of our model. Leveraging these insights, dicast outperforms state-of-the-art short-read-based callers and consensus approaches, identifying considerably more true-positive variants while maintaining a high precision. We also demonstrate the methods applicability in diagnostic scenarios using putative pathogenic candidates in a limb malformation cohort, as well as known pathogenic variants in atrial fibrillation and neuromuscular disease cohorts. Dicast identifies all known pathogenic variants and 20% more manually confirmed candidate deletions than a consensus approach, and therefore can be used to reliably reduce time-consuming manual inspection in diagnostics.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms driving these persistent alterations remain poorly understood. Here, we used brain-wide transcriptomic profiling to define the molecular landscape of parity-induced neural plasticity, identifying the dorsal hippocampal formation (dHF) as a key site of transcriptional remodeling. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing with a maternal-pup separation paradigm, we additionally demonstrated that chronic postpartum stress significantly disrupts dHF adaptations by altering dopamine dynamics, leading to changes in the dopamine-dependent histone post-translational modification - H3 dopaminylation, with further alterations in transcription, cellular plasticity, and behavior. In human dorsal subiculum, a brain structure within the dHF, we uncovered conserved patterns of parity-dependent alterations in H3 dopaminylation and transcription. We further established the sufficiency of dopamine modulation in regulating these parity-induced adaptations via chemogenetic suppression of dopamine release into the dHF, which recapitulated key epigenomic and behavioral features of parity in virgin female mice. In sum, our findings establish dopamine as a central regulator of parity-induced neuroadaptations in humans and mice, revealing a fundamental transcriptional mechanism by which female reproductive experiences remodel the brain to sustain long-term behavioral adaptations.",NA,biorxiv

We developed the tool Seed2LP, addressing the inverse problem of predicting source nutrients, or seeds, from a GSMN and a metabolic objective. The originality of Seed2LP is its hybrid model, combining a scalable and discrete Boolean approximation of metabolic activity, with the numerically accurate flux balance analysis (FBA).

Here, we identify a novel regulatory mechanism by which cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity controls the abundance and chromatin recruitment of the origin firing factors TRESLIN and MTBP to promote dormant origin activation. Inhibition of WEE1 kinase during S phase increases CDK activity, which blocks the PCNA-dependent degradation of TRESLIN and enhances its chromatin association along with MTBP. This increased loading is required for elevated helicase recruitment and DNA synthesis under CDK-hyperactive conditions. These effects are reversed by CDK inhibition and depend on both TRESLIN and MTBP. We define a conserved sequence within TRESLIN required for its CDK-sensitive degradation. Significantly, the recruitment of TRESLIN-MTBP and loading of helicase exceed levels observed in unperturbed S phase, supporting a model in which dormant origin firing is actively upregulated through CDK-mediated stabilization of the initiation machinery. These findings uncover a new control point in replication origin usage with implications for genome stability and therapeutic kinase inhibition.",NA,biorxiv

With the advent of fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) and other technological advances in microscopy techniques, much more is now known about how the filamentous actin (F-actin) and microtubule (MT) networks work within cells to give rise to the vast array of functions which require them. A current challenge to the imaging field is to improve the utility and accuracy of the computational approaches required to analyze large and complex imaging datasets. Here, we present the results of a computational method that, when applied to FSM time-lapse series, can capture the instantaneous state of the rapidly changing, dense, and multi-directional speckle flows often exhibited by cytoskeletal dynamics in living systems. Re-analysis of previously published FSM image sets demonstrates that this method, which we call the Instantaneous Flow Tracking Algorithm (IFTA), can accurately detect speckle flows in mitotic spindles and F-actin meshworks, even in regions of high dynamicity of overlapping, anti-parallel flows where previous methods failed.

MethodsThe anti-parallel flow at the metaphase plate of the mitotic spindle is a well-known phenomenon during the initial stages of chromosome segregation and it has been measured by several approaches, mostly in stationary spindles which do not exhibit any polar rotation. The mitotic spindle is the target of many cancer and neurodegenerative drugs and as such, there has been many attempts at inhibiting its basic functions with the objective of preventing chromosome segregation and the formation of new daughter cells. Such attempts have largely been focused on the inhibition of the action of MT plus-end directed motors, for instance the kinesin KIF11. Spindles with inhibited kinesins have been thought to exhibit no MT flux, however IFTA measured regional flux of up to 2.7 {micro}m/min, which reveals the activity of potent secondary flux mechanisms. These results suggest novel, additional, approaches toward arresting cells in mitosis during patient treatment.

ResultsThe traditional tracking methods erroneously measure zero flux in areas where contractile F-actin flows meet, denoted as a ""convergence zone"" and commonly found in the lamella of motile cells and the neck of growth cones. When IFTA was used to analyze FSM datasets derived from these structures, we detected high rates of protein turnover, anti-parallel speckle motion, and fast flux of actin subunits in both directions in the same ""convergence zones"". This demonstrates the presence of a molecular machinery based on contractility in the lamella/lamellipodium of migrating cells and at the base of growing neurons, which can be exploited in the clinic. When applied to FSM data of migrating kangaroo rat kidney epithelial PtK1 cells overexpressing different isoforms of the actin-based motor tropomyosin, IFTA revealed distinct, isoform-specific effects on contractile F-actin flows. Specifically, we found that decreased affinity between tropomyosin and F-actin correlated with an increase in speckle velocity heterogeneity.

ConclusionsSuch quantitative imaging analysis offers the ability to reliably test novel therapeutics ex vivo.

Significance statementThe main discoveries presented in the manuscript are related to the ability of the cell to adapt to a range of biochemical and mechanical perturbations. As cell therapy is becoming the forefront of precision medicine, it would be critical to anticipate the mechanisms of action of engineered immune cells. The pathways activated during therapy can be pinpointed by measuring its effects on the target proteins in patient-derived living cells. The clinical application of the approach outlined in this manuscript pertains to analyzing drug resistance in cancer therapy and the treatment of neurodegeneration. Our hypothesis is that targeting actin in resistant tumors could sensitize cancer cells to tubulin inhibitors. If this proves true, it will have implications in the clinic.",NA,biorxiv

Morphology, gene expression, cell death and functional assessments detected no apparent alterations of EHTs and NOs in co-culture under normal conditions. By contrast, NOs significantly ameliorated glucolipotoxicity in EHTs. Transcriptomic and protein secretion assays identified the extracellular matrix protein versican as a key molecule that was transferred from NOs into EHTs in the high-glucose/fatty acid condition.

Regularly outnumbered tenfold by phages, bacteria have responded to the constant threat of phage predation by evolving a vast array of sophisticated defense systems. Among these, prokaryotic Argonautes (pAgos) are nucleic acid-guided endonucleases that target complementary sequences of invading mobile genetic elements (MGEs). However, as the preference for targeting MGE sequences has been demonstrated in only a limited number of pAgos, their precise physiological functions remain elusive. Here, we discovered a pAgo in Exiguobacterium sp. AB2, EsAgo, encoded in close proximity to other putative defense systems on the E. AB2 genome. Such clustering into genomic ""defense islands"" is a common phenomenon among prokaryotic defense systems, further implicating pAgos with a role in host defense. Accordingly, we had sought to characterize EsAgo as a nucleic acid-guided nucleic acid-targeting nuclease against MGEs for bacterial defense in this study.

ResultsUsing sequence to structure homology tools, we show that the predicted model of EsAgo exhibits the structural characteristics typical of a full-length, catalytically active, DNA-guided pAgo. Akin to other pAgos, EsAgo uses a divalent cation cofactor to indiscriminately ""chop"" plasmids in vitro. Furthermore, a site-directed double mutant of EsAgo bearing two missense mutations at the catalytic site exhibited significantly reduced levels of this random plasmid-degrading activity. Lastly, when EsAgo was supplied with synthetic 5-P ssDNA guides, random nuclease activity was attenuated and may have resulted in the sequence-specific cleavage of dsDNA at 37{degrees}C.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that EsAgo functions as a DNA-interfering nuclease with or without DNA guides. Within the cell, it is possible that EsAgo utilizes this mechanism to screen and destroy foreign genetic elements. Moreover, the potential capacity for specific dsDNA cleavage at moderate temperatures gives rise to intriguing possibilities of repurposing EsAgo as a programmable nuclease for future biotechnological use.",NA,biorxiv

Electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and pupillometric records were obtained from 65 adults during the performance of a sustained attention to response task (SART). Thought probes were intermittently administered during the SART to collect subjective reports of attentional state (i.e., on-task, mind-wandering, mind-blanking) and vigilance level (i.e., alertness vs. sleepiness). Mind-wandering and mind-blanking reports increased in frequency with time-on-task and were accompanied by decreases in alertness and pupil-linked arousal, but evinced distinct psychophysiological and behavioural profiles. While mind-wandering was associated with greater heart-rate variability and late modulation of the heartbeat-evoked potential, mind-blanking was characterised by greater decreases in heart-rate, pupil size, and brain-heart coupling.

Despite extensive research, we have limited understanding of the mechanisms coupling obesity to cancer risk, and separately, of the contexts where obesity does or does not exacerbate disease. Here, we show that chronic high-fat diet induced obesity has no significant effect on the Trp53R270H/+ mouse, a model of human Li-Fraumeni multi-cancer syndrome. Surprisingly, despite inducing rapid and highly penetrant obesity and long-term differences in adiposity, greater than one year of HFD had no significant effect on survival or tumor burden. These findings were replicated in two separate cohorts totaling 359 mice and thus provide important negative data for the field. Given strong publication bias against negative data in the literature, this large murine cohort study represents a clear case where chronic diet-induced obesity does not accelerate or aggravate cancer outcomes. The data thus carry high impact for researchers, funders, and policymakers alike.",NA,biorxiv

This study aimed to integrate EPNs into sustainable organic potato cultivation through an innovative three-stage release technology. The efficacy of Steinernema feltiae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was evaluated using three different application methods: 1) waterless release through alginate capsules, 2) mixing multiple isolates in an aqueous suspension, and 3) field distribution via Agrotis segetum larvae. The pathogenic potential of the EPNs was assessed based on pest mortality rates and their persistence under different conditions. Results indicated that alginate capsules extended EPN activity by up to 30%, while the aqueous suspension increased pest mortality by 20%. Nematodes distributed via Agrotis segetum larvae achieved the highest mortality rates, providing direct pest targeting. Among the tested methods, S. feltiae exhibited up to 96.3% efficacy against potato pests under laboratory conditions, while H. bacteriophora demonstrated 86.4% efficacy in field trials. The three-stage release technology proved to be a sustainable and effective approach for pest management in organic potato cultivation, making it a promising strategy for broader implementation.",NA,biorxiv

This fMRI study fills that gap by varying the number of English words presented while holding the amount of visual stimulation constant. We adapted the ""simultaneous suppression"" paradigm, which has demonstrated that the response to multiple stimuli presented simultaneously is typically smaller than the sum of responses to the same stimuli presented sequentially. On each trial, participants viewed rapid sequences of three frames. Each frame contained two character strings, most of which were pseudo-letters with visual features matched to familiar letters. The experimental conditions differed in the number of English words in the sequence: zero words; one word; two words sequentially; or two words simultaneously. Behaviorally, participants performed worse at detecting two words presented simultaneously than sequentially. In the brain, the BOLD response increased linearly with the number of words presented in several reading-related regions of the left hemisphere: the inferior frontal sulcus, the intraparietal sulcus, the superior temporal sulcus, and text-selective occipito-temporal regions. But the mean response magnitudes did not differ between sequential and simultaneous presentation of two words. Nonetheless, the sensitivity of ventral temporal text-selective regions to two words lexical frequencies was attenuated by simultaneous presentation. This suggests that words were processed less deeply when they competed simultaneously. Our new paradigm, therefore, reveals processing capacity limits in the reading circuitry.",NA,biorxiv

In FLT3-mutant AML, the selection of clones harboring heterogeneous RAS mutations drives resistance to FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i). RAS activation is also associated with resistance to other AML targeted therapies, including the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. Despite the critical need to inhibit RAS/MAPK signaling in AML, no targeted therapies have demonstrated clinical benefit in RAS-driven AML. To address this unmet need, we investigated the preclinical activity of RMC-7977, a multi-selective inhibitor of GTP-bound active [RAS(ON)] isoforms of mutant and wild-type RAS in AML models. RMC-7977 exhibited potent antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity across AML cell lines with MAPK-activating signaling mutations. In cell line models with acquired FLT3i resistance due to secondary RAS mutations, treatment with RMC-7977 restored sensitivity to FLT3i. Similarly, RMC-7977 effectively reversed resistance to venetoclax in RAS-addicted cell line models with both RAS wild-type and mutant genetic backgrounds. In murine patient-derived xenograft models of RAS-mutant AML, RMC-7977 was well tolerated and significantly suppressed leukemic burden in combination with gilteritinib or venetoclax. Our findings strongly support clinical investigation of broad-spectrum RAS(ON) inhibition in AML to treat and potentially prevent drug resistance due to activated RAS signaling.",NA,biorxiv

We set out to examine memory reactivations associated with a serial reaction time task (SRTT). 48 human participants performed the SRTT, and then slept in the lab while we deliberately induced reactivation in Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) using a Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) design. We detected reactivation after TMR cues using multiclass classification that adapted to sleep data by using sleep activity for training and wake activity for testing. We then examined the temporal properties of reactivation in relation to behavioural performance and sleep spindles. In keeping with the rodent literature, the observed reactivation was 3 to 20 times faster than waking activity. Furthermore, we report an inverted-U shaped relationship between TMR-related behavioural improvement and encoding strength, with very strong and very weak memories benefiting little from cueing while medium-strength memories benefit the most. Finally, reactivation was more frequently observed in trials with high sigma power, supporting the idea that sleep spindles are associated with memory reactivation during sleep. These findings bring us closer to understanding the characteristics of human memory reactivation after TMR, demonstrate when cueing is effective, and provide evidence for the positive relationship between the detectability of reactivation and memory consolidation.",NA,biorxiv

With winter wheat cultivar Rubisko as a case study, we propose to apply a calibration protocol to estimate the parameters of this new cultivar with multi-trials experimental data. We tested the calibration protocol in different conditions including or not LAI and/or biomass experimental data and we found that the resulting LAI and biomass dynamics strongly diverge. Several key findings emerge from this study: (1) RUE parameters should be excluded from the calibration process, as their critical role in biomass dynamics causes the optimization algorithm to treat them as adjustment parameters, resulting in unrealistic values for multiple parameters; (2) either LAI or biomass variables alone are sufficient for calibration, enabling experimental efforts to focus on one variable rather than both; and (3) the use of a synthetic dataset has facilitated the identification of the optimal type and timing of data collection needed to parameterize a new variety in the model. Moreover, the proposed methodology offers extrapolatable solutions applicable to other contexts (e.g., different models or datasets) and provides guidance on acquiring the most effective dataset for optimal calibration. The unbalanced structure of our dataset also highlighted the need to mobilize other calibration criteria (weighted RMSE) and alternative solutions to bridge the gap between quantitative metrics and empirical visual assessments.",NA,biorxiv

Aberrant activity of striatal D1- and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-/D2-MSNs) underlies LID, but the mechanisms driving its progression remain unclear. Using the 6-OHDA mouse model of PD/LID, we combined in vivo and ex vivo recordings to isolate the effect of repeated treatment in LID worsening and other motor fluctuation-related phenotypes. We found that LID worsening is linked to potentiation of levodopa-evoked responses in both D1-/D2-MSNs, independent of changes in dopamine release or MSN intrinsic excitability. Instead, strengthening of glutamatergic synapses onto D1-MSNs emerged as a key driver. Moreover, we found changes in D2-MSN activity that specifically influenced LID duration, potentially contributing to motor fluctuations, which paralleled a reduction in D2R sensitivity. These findings reveal striatal adaptations contributing to worsening of levodopa-related complications.",NA,biorxiv

Here we use cryo-EM to visualize the continuous motion of nucleosomal DNA induced by human chromatin remodeler SNF2H, an ISWI family member. Our work reveals conformational changes in SNF2H, DNA and histones during nucleosome sliding and provides the structural basis for DNA translocation. ATP hydrolysis induces conformational changes in SNF2H that pull the DNA tracking strand, distorting DNA and histones at SHL2. This is followed by SNF2H rotation on the nucleosome, which first pulls the DNA guide strand and creates one-base pair bulge at SHL2, and then releases the pulled DNA. Given the high conservation of the catalytic motors among ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, the mechanisms we describe likely apply to other families.",NA,biorxiv

While Plx3397 administration increased synaptic density in 5xFAD mice, it also reduced the percentage of neurons phase-locked to gamma oscillations. This neural decoupling was closely associated with gene expression changes related to synapse organization. These observations prompted us to investigate whether gamma-frequency entrainment could counteract the neural circuit alterations induced by Plx3397 administration. We thus enhanced gamma phase-locking in neurons using non-invasive patterned sensory light stimulation. Remarkably, restoring gamma oscillations improved neural function, reshaped gene expression signatures, and improved learning and memory in Plx3397-treated 5xFAD mice.
